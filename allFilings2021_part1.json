Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us.",
        "Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions, may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us.",
        "Certain environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility.",
        "We are named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.",
        "In 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.",
        "To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $4 million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. Costs could also increase as a result of additional test and remediation obligations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency or California Regional Water Quality Control Board. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. We believe that the potential liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.",

The ERGs at AEP include Abled and Disabled Allies Partnering Together, the African-American ERG, the Asian-American ERG, the Hispanic Origin Latin American ERG, the Military Veteran ERG, the Native American ERG and the Pride Partnership.  Our ERGs reflect the diverse makeup of our workforce and enable us to gain valuable insight into the diverse communities we serve.  They also help increase engagement across AEP by providing employees with a safe space to discuss work-related issues and to develop innovative solutions.  ERGs also play an active role in AEP’s diversity and inclusion efforts, including recruitment of new employees.  In addition to the ERG’s, AEP also sponsors the AEP Women’s Leadership Council.  The mission of this council is to educate, inspire and encourage women to build confidence and reflect on their goals as they strive for career and personal growth.",

Accordingly, we have insinuated that belief throughout the fabric of our operations in our approach toward our employees. Indeed, the first two core values underlying our commitment to sustainability (see, 2017/2018 Sustainability Report, www.american-vanguard.com under ESG tab) are “Safety First” – which is a culture that begins with highly-regulated manufacturing plants, continues into the design of science-backed products and extends into market-leading delivery systems – and “Making a Difference” – under which, by rewarding achievement and giving our employees a voice, we attract diverse employees who want to make a difference in their careers, in the company and in the communities that we serve.

Trump said, “If you work in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the Department of Homeland Security, such as healthcare services and pharmaceutical and food supply, you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule [emphasis added].” We have found that state COVID-19 orders and, indeed, even those of countries in which the outbreak has been most pronounced, have consistently excepted food supply as an area essential to the survival of its populations and, as such, had given special permission to companies, such as ours, to continue to operate during the pandemic.  ",
        "In light of our status within the critical infrastructure, at the outset of the pandemic, the Company took swift action to understand, contain and mitigate the risks posed by this pandemic. Specifically, we formed a Pandemic Work Group to design and implement protocols for social distancing, make provisions for the workforce to work remotely where possible, establish quarantine, tracing and leave-of-absence policies for those who present COVID-like symptom or may have been in touch with those who have. Further, the group has kept current with local, state, federal and international laws and restrictions that could affect the business; provided real-time information to the workforce including with respect to testing and vaccinations; and drawn from political commentary and news statements concrete directions on how best to continue operations. We have also prepared contingency plans to permit the continued operation of our factories, in the event that there are critical staffing issues due to attrition. Further, we have continuously monitored supply chain, transport, logistics and border closures and have reached out to third-parties to make clear that we are continuing to operate, that we have our own policies relating to health and safety (e.g., all staff who can work remotely were instructed so to do and were provided with the necessary IT equipment, no third-party visitors, no face-to-face meetings) and are committed to compliance with COVID-19 policies of our business partners. Our CEO and the Pandemic Work Group have held regular “state of the company” calls with the functional heads of our businesses across the globe to ensure that our information is shared in a timely manner and that our direction is clear. ",
        "In keeping with our charge to operate as an essential business and by virtue of our efforts to contain and mitigate the risks posed by the pandemic, we have been able to manage our business with minimal disruption during the reporting period. As referred to in this Form 10-K (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the coronavirus has affected our overall performance to a degree. Lost opportunities for certain new product launches, inability to meet both existing and potential new customers face-to-face, reduced demand for commodity crops sold to restaurants, and foreign exchange effects in Brazil, Mexico and Australia, have likely limited the Company’s top-line growth by up to several million dollars and the associated profitability, to an indeterminate degree, since the inception of the pandemic.  ",
        "Risk Management",
        "The Company regularly monitors matters, whether insurable or not, that could pose material risk to its operations, the safety of its employees and neighbors, and its financial performance. The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (“Board”) was formed in 2010, consists of four members of the Board and meets regularly. However, all members of the Board are invited to and regularly attend Risk Committee meetings. Working with senior management, the committee continuously evaluates the Company’s risk profile, identifies mitigation measures and ensures that the Company is prudently managing these risks. ",
        "8",
        "Further, in support of the Risk Committee, senior management has appointed a risk manager who is focused on addressing each of the most material risks facing the Company. The top risks identified by management (in no particular order) include: adverse political and regulatory climate; managing inventory and optimizing manufacturing efficiency; succession planning and bench strength; maintaining a competitive edge in the marketplace; the possibility of an environmental event; undervaluation of the Company; availability of acquisition and licensing targets and cyber-terrorism. In addition, the Company continually evaluates insurance levels for product liability, property damage and other potential areas of risk. Management believes its facilities and equipment are adequately insured against loss from usual business risks including cyber-terrorism.",
        "Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)",
        "At the center of our ESG commitment is the principle of Sustainable Agriculture. While this concept has been used by many to mean many different things, we have given it a very clear meaning. In our parlance, Sustainable Agriculture is broad enough to encompass a comprehensive ESG program, but clear enough to give us direction in our outlook and purpose in our activities. Please click on the “ESG” tab at www.american-vanguard.com to access the documents mentioned below. ",
        "Access to food is a basic human right and is at the core of our commitment to sustainable agriculture. All people should be able to rely on a stable, affordable food supply both now and into the future. We are committed to meeting that need upon a foundation of social responsibility and equity. In that vein, we believe that sustainable agriculture must include these three principles:",
        "Climate Equity – as outlined in our Climate Change Commitment, we are committed to making enterprise-wide, progressive and measurable efforts to do our part to help to arrest the trend of global warming. In making decisions, taking actions and conducting our operations we are mindful of climate equity, which holds that climate change has three primary effects – generational, regional and individual. To that end, we believe that reducing our carbon footprint and, through our products and services, enabling others to do so will advance climate equity consistent with the goal of a 2-degree warmer world, as outlined in the Paris Agreement. Whether in terms of eco-friendly products – such as natural oils from Envance (used in Proctor & Gamble’s Zevo product line), microbial High Yield solutions from Agrinos (that enhance soil health and promote carbon sequestration) or tailored bionutritional products from Greenplants – or delivery systems, such as our SIMPAS precision application system that maximizes yield while minimizing the environmental footprint – we are endeavoring to making the planet a better place than we found it. ",
        "Environmental Equity – we recognize that our planet has limited resources and that what we do with them has an effect on the habitat for both humans and other species, both for today and tomorrow. We also recognize that our activities can affect the environment generationally, regionally and individually. We are, therefore, committed to environmental equity in our operations. Specifically, and as more fully outlined in our sustainability reports, we seek to conserve finite resources such as water, land and energy while protecting the environment and enhancing biodiversity, so that these resources are available in amounts and quality to support our neighbors and future generations. In addition, we have committed significant resources toward supporting growers with precision application technology – like SIMPAS and Ultimus – that enable growers to manage, optimize and trace the use of crop and soil inputs, and to use only what is needed, precisely where it is needed. Furthermore, we are mindful of those who might be disproportionately affected by what we do, such as loaders and applicators of our products. To that end, we have been at the forefront of user-friendly, closed delivery systems (from Lock ‘n Load to SMARTBox to SIMPAS/SmartCartridges) to minimize exposure and maximize safety for those on-the-ground. ",
        "Food Equity – we are committed to the proposition that access to food is a basic human right. Implicit in that commitment is the principle of food equity, which has three aspects, once again, generational, regional and individual. First, food security – we believe it is essential to ensure the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of the global agricultural industry. We contribute toward food security by investing in eco-friendly solutions and in new technology, like SIMPAS, that give growers the best tools possible to ensure that their operations are viable, both today and tomorrow. Second, food availability – ensuring that food gets from field to table. As we saw in the pandemic, the supply chain for food can be broken, and those who suffer most are often those farthest from the fields. To that end, we support farm-to-field efforts and programs to reduce food waste. Third, food affordability – ensuring that food prices can be maintained for all, including the impoverished. We do this by giving farmers effective tools, including precision application equipment, that optimize their costs, boost their yield, and enable them to produce and market food at reasonable prices. ",
        "Social Responsibility – our discussion of Sustainable Agriculture would not be complete without specific mention of our commitment to social responsibility. This concept is inherent in all forms of equity, be they climate, environmental or food related. However, social responsibility gives us pause to consider factors of a more fundamental nature, such as human rights. Our Human Rights Policy details our essential belief that we respect and support human rights, both within and without our operations. We believe that it is fundamental to our corporate responsibility and, indeed, to our humanity, that we recognize, respect and nurture the freedom and dignity of all persons. To that end, we support the tenets of the International Bill of Human Rights, including the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN framework on Corporate Responsibility to Respect Human Rights (which is one section of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights) and the UN International Labor Organization on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.  ",
        "9",
        "Under the umbrella of Sustainable Agriculture, we are committed to operating our business with a sense of mindfulness – toward the climate, toward the environment and toward the good of humans and other species. We consider ourselves to be part of a broader mission – one of ensuring that people can rely upon a stable, affordable food supply both now and in the future. It is a privilege to be part of that mission. With that privilege comes responsibility, and we take that responsibility seriously.  "

We have robust leadership development review and succession planning processes, which provide individually targeted development opportunities for our team members. Development, which emphasizes on-the-job development and coaching, also includes live and on-line training, special projects and in some cases cross-functional or cross-regional work assignments.  Diversity & Inclusion  A diverse global workforce and an inclusive culture are essential to our remaining at the forefront of materials science and manufacturing. One way we support our employees to bring their whole selves to the workplace is through our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). ERGs bring together employees who have shared interests and a common desire to make our company a more open and inclusive workplace. Our ERGs currently include 13 groups focused on driving inclusion and advancement for women, employees of color, LGBTQ+ employees, veterans and others.  Pay & Benefits  Our compensation philosophy is to offer market-based, competitive wages and benefits in all markets where we compete for talent – all of our employees were paid at least the applicable legal minimum wage, and 97% of our employees were paid above the applicable legal minimum wage at year-end 2020. Pay is positioned around the market median, with variances based on knowledge, skills, years of experience and performance. In addition to base wages, our compensation and benefit programs – which vary by region, country and business unit – include short-term incentives, long-term incentives (e.g., cash- and stock-based awards), employee savings plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, flexible work arrangements, and employee assistance programs. We regularly evaluate pay equity, expanding our review in 2020 to include race/ethnicity in addition to gender, and we make adjustments to compensation where needed.

In 2020, our global Recordable Incident Rate of 0.21 in 2020 was significantly lower than the Occupational Safety and Health Administration manufacturing industry average of 3.0 in 2019 (the most recent available industry average).  Employee Engagement  Because we believe that an engaged workforce is a more innovative, productive and satisfied workforce, promoting retention and minimizing employee turnover, we annually conduct a global employee engagement survey. Our business and functional teams use the results of our survey to identify and implement actions to address noted areas of improvement. While employee engagement is the result of many factors, we believe strong, encouraging and open leadership, as well as a continued effort to foster a collaborative, supportive culture, leads to strong workforce engagement.

Pay is positioned around the market median, with variances based on knowledge, skills, years of experience and performance. In addition to base wages, our compensation and benefit programs – which vary by region, country and business unit – include short-term incentives, long-term incentives (e.g., cash- and stock-based awards), employee savings plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, flexible work arrangements, and employee assistance programs.

Synovus supports our employees’ involvement in external development programs, such as specialty banking schools and other technical training. As a part of our learning and development program, Synovus offers a tuition assistance program for employees seeking undergraduate and graduate degrees and other continuing educational programs.",
        "In addition, we regularly conduct employee engagement surveys and touchpoints to gauge employee satisfaction.",
        "Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DE&I”)",
        "Since launching the CEO-sponsored initiative in 2018, Synovus has continued its work to improve employee diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition to revising job posting guidelines, enhancing leadership training related to unconscious bias and hiring a diversity and inclusion officer who reports directly to the Chief Strategy and Customer Experience Officer, Synovus has continued to make progress toward its DE&I objectives in 2020. As a result, representation of women in senior leadership roles improved from 33% at the launch of the initiative to 37% at the end of 2020, and people of color in senior leadership roles improved from 8% at launch to 14% at the end of 2020. Moreover, we have set targets of 40% female and 15% people of color representation in senior leadership by the end of 2021.",
        "To build and attract a diverse workforce, in 2020, Synovus continued to identify key organizations and partnerships to strengthen our recruiting efforts. We expanded our campus recruiting and scholarship programs, recruiting at Latinx organizations and additional historically black colleges and universities and funding a $1.0 million contribution to the United Negro College Fund for the establishment of a scholarship for African American students in our footprint. We continued to partner with diverse external professional organizations such as the Latin American Association Unidos in Finance program and leveraged our employee resource groups for internal referrals. We also revitalized our internship and accelerated banker recruiting and selection process in 2020, having an intern class that was 26% people of color and 26% female and an accelerated banker class that was 30% people of color and 40% female.",
        "As to the existing workforce, in 2020, Synovus continued to focus on foundational progress toward increasing DE&I, launching five employee resource groups to assist with talent acquisition, development and community outreach, increasing the internal dialogue through fireside chats and listen and learn events, enhancing unconscious bias training across the organization and developing robust DE&I strategies across each business unit. In 2020, we established an internal advisory council to the CEO, comprised of certain senior African American leaders, to assist and advise executive management on these critical issues. Executive management was also required to submit DE&I self-assessments for the year 2020.",
        "In 2020, Synovus launched an initiative to analyze ethnicity pay, and we are in the process of completing that analysis. In 2021, we will refresh our gender pay analysis to augment our pay equity work of 2018 and 2019. In August 2020, Synovus was named by Forbes as one of America’s best employers for women.",
        "Employee Health and Safety",
        "Synovus is committed to operating in a safe, secure and responsible manner for the benefit of our employees, customers and communities. Synovus provides a range of programs to improve the physical, financial and emotional well-being of our employees, including a range of health and wellness benefits, and strives to create a safe and healthy workplace for all employees.",

This re-entry was carefully designed by employees themselves and carefully monitored through re-entry surveys and touchpoints. We remain committed to employee safety and well-being as we continue to manage through the ongoing pandemic. ",
        "Supervision, Regulation and Other Factors ",
        "We are extensively regulated under federal and state law. The following is a brief summary that does not purport to be a complete description of all regulations that affect us or all aspects of those regulations. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions described below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to the Company’s and Synovus Bank’s business. In addition, proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal levels. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, and the impact such changes may have on us and Synovus Bank, are difficult to predict. In addition, bank regulatory agencies may issue enforcement actions, policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us or to Synovus Bank. Changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory guidance, or their interpretation by regulatory agencies or courts may have a material adverse effect on our and Synovus Bank’s business, operations, and earnings. ",
        "Synovus Bank, Synovus Trust, and in some cases, we and our nonbank affiliates, must undergo regular examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency, which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities. A bank regulator conducting an examination has complete access to the books and records of the examined institution. The results of the examination are confidential. Supervision and regulation of banks, their holding companies and affiliates is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and customers, the DIF of the FDIC, and the U.S. banking and financial system rather than holders of our capital. ",
        "Regulation of the Company",
        "We are registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act and have elected to be treated as a financial holding company. As such, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve and are subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. Federal law subjects bank holding companies, such as the Company, to restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. In addition, the GA DBF regulates bank holding companies that own Georgia-chartered banks, such as us, under the bank holding company laws of the State of Georgia. Various federal and state bodies regulate and supervise our non-bank activities including our brokerage, investment advisory, insurance agency and processing operations. These include, but are not limited to, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, federal and state banking regulators and various state regulators of insurance and brokerage activities.",
        "Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in regulatory agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company. Like all bank holding companies, we are regulated extensively under federal and state law. Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, state banking regulators, the Federal Reserve Board, and separately the FDIC as the insurer of bank deposits, have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if they determine that we have insufficient capital or other resources, or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under this authority, our regulators can require us or our subsidiaries to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which we would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions.",
        "If we become subject to and are unable to comply with the terms of any future regulatory actions or directives, supervisory agreements, or orders, then we could become subject to additional, heightened supervisory actions and orders, possibly including consent orders, prompt corrective action restrictions and/or other regulatory actions, including prohibitions on the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock. If our regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial condition, and the value of our common stock and preferred stock. See “Part ",

        "” of this Report.",
        "Activity Limitations",
        "As a financial holding company, we are permitted to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bank holding company that has not elected to be a financial holding company.",
        "Bank holding companies are generally restricted to engaging in the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and certain other activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking. Financial holding companies may also engage in activities that are considered to be financial in nature, as well as those incidental or, if determined by the Federal Reserve, complementary to financial activities.",
        "If Synovus Bank ceases to be “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards, or if Synovus Bank receives a rating of less than satisfactory under the CRA, the Federal Reserve Board may, among other things, place limitations on our ability to conduct these broader financial activities or, if the deficiencies persist, require us to divest the banking subsidiary or the businesses engaged in activities permissible only for financial holding companies.",
        "In addition, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any nonbanking activity or terminate its ownership or control of any nonbank subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company.",
        "As further described below, each of the Company and Synovus Bank is well-capitalized under applicable regulatory standards as of December 31, 2020, and Synovus Bank has an overall rating of “Satisfactory” in its most recent CRA evaluation.",
        "Source of Strength Obligations",
        "A bank holding company, such as us, is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank.",
        "The term “source of financial strength” means the ability of a company, such as us, that directly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution, such as Synovus Bank, to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of financial distress. The appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution (in the case of Synovus Bank, this agency is the Federal Reserve) may require reports from us to assess our ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements by requiring us to provide financial assistance to Synovus Bank in the event of financial distress. If we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the Dodd-Frank Act, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of Synovus Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the FDIC, as appropriate, and entitled to a priority of payment. In addition, the FDIC provides that any insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or any assistance provided by the FDIC to, a commonly controlled insured depository institution. Synovus Bank is an FDIC-insured depository institution and thus subject to these requirements.",
        "Acquisitions",
        "The BHC Act permits acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies, such that we and any other bank holding company, whether located in Georgia or elsewhere, may acquire a bank located in any other state, subject to certain deposit-percentage, age of bank charter requirements, and other restrictions. The BHC Act requires that a bank holding company obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any additional bank or bank holding company, (ii) taking any action that causes an additional bank or bank holding company to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company.",
        "The Federal Reserve may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider: (1) the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including performance under the CRA; and (4) the effectiveness of the company in combatting money laundering.",
        "Change in Control",
        "Federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as the Company, or before acquiring control of any state member bank, such as Synovus Bank. Upon receipt of such notice, the Federal Reserve ",
        "7",
        "may approve or disapprove the acquisition. The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a person or group acquires the power to vote 10% or more of our outstanding common stock. The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of the Company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock.",
        "Governance and Financial Reporting Obligations",
        "We are required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the PCAOB, and the NYSE. In particular, we are required to include management and independent registered public accounting firm reports on internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have evaluated our controls, including compliance with the SEC rules on internal controls, and have and expect to continue to spend significant amounts of time and money on compliance with these rules. Our failure to comply with these internal control rules may materially adversely affect our reputation, ability to obtain the necessary certifications to financial statements, and the values of our securities. The assessments of our financial reporting controls as of December 31, 2020 are included in this report under “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.”",
        "The Federal Reserve also requires bank holding companies meeting certain asset size thresholds, such as us, to establish and maintain a risk committee of its board of directors and appoint a chief risk officer, each meeting certain requirements.",
        "Volcker Rule",
        "Section 13 to the BHC Act, commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule,” generally prohibits us and our subsidiaries from (i) engaging in certain proprietary trading, and (ii) acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a “covered fund,” all subject to certain exceptions. The Volcker Rule also specifies certain limited activities in which we and our subsidiaries may continue to engage and required us to implement a compliance program. The Federal Reserve permits limited exemptions, upon application, for divestiture of certain “illiquid” covered funds, for an additional period of up to 5 years beyond that date. In the first quarter of 2017, we obtained a five-year extension from the Federal Reserve to the divestiture requirement of certain funds held by us and covered by this rule. In 2020, amendments to the proprietary trading and covered funds regulations issued by the federal banking agencies, the SEC, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission took effect, simplifying compliance and providing additional exclusions and exemptions.",
        "Incentive Compensation",
        "The Dodd-Frank Act required the banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint rules or guidelines for financial institutions with more than $1 billion in assets, such as us and Synovus Bank, which prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that the agencies determine to encourage inappropriate risks by the institution. The federal banking agencies issued proposed rules in 2011 and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies. In 2016, the federal banking agencies also proposed rules that would, depending upon the assets of the institution, directly regulate incentive compensation arrangements and would require enhanced oversight and recordkeeping. As of December 31, 2020, these rules have not been implemented. We and Synovus Bank have undertaken efforts to ensure that our incentive compensation plans do not encourage inappropriate risks, consistent with three key principles - that incentive compensation arrangements should appropriately balance risk and financial rewards, be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance.",
        "Other Regulatory Matters",
        "We and our subsidiaries are subject to oversight by the SEC, the FINRA, the PCAOB, the NYSE and various state securities and insurance regulators. We and our subsidiaries have from time to time received requests for information from regulatory authorities in various states, including state attorneys general, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, concerning our business practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business.",
        "Capital Requirements",
        "We and Synovus Bank are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the Federal Reserve may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks, are important factors that are to be taken into account in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on our capital levels.",
        "8",
        "We and Synovus Bank are subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a CET1 risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total risk-based capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.",
        "CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock plus retained earnings less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, certain “high volatility” commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings.",
        "The leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average total consolidated assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. The required minimum leverage ratio for all banks and bank holding companies is 4%.",
        "In addition, effective January 1, 2019, the capital rules required a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total capital), which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress.",
        "These buffer requirements must be met for a bank or bank holding company to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without restriction.",
        "The FDICIA, among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: “well capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized”, and “critically undercapitalized”. A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC, are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans for regulatory approval. A depository institution's holding company must guarantee any required capital restoration plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution's assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. Federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution's capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. ",
        "To be well-capitalized, Synovus Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios:",
        "•",
        "6.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;",
        "•",
        "8.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets;",

        "10.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and",
        "•",
        "5.0% leverage ratio.",
        "The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the current capital rules applicable to banks. For purposes of the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y, including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company, bank holding companies, such as the Company, must maintain a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater to be well-capitalized. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to bank holding companies as that applicable to Synovus Bank, the Company’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. Also, the Federal Reserve may require bank holding companies, including the Company, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company’s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.",
        "Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition.",
        "Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Company’s or Synovus Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth.",

        "In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which introduced CECL as the methodology to replace the current “incurred loss” methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost, and changed the approaches for recognizing and recording credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased credit impaired financial assets. Under the incurred loss methodology, credit losses are recognized only when the losses are probable or have been incurred; under CECL, companies are required to recognize the full amount of expected credit losses for the lifetime of the financial assets, based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This change results in earlier recognition of credit losses that the Company deems expected but not yet probable. The Company began its compliance beginning with the first fiscal quarter of 2020.

        "A continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act broadened the application of anti-money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as broker-dealers, investment advisors and insurance companies, and strengthened the ability of the U.S. Government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal provisions of Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act require that regulated financial institutions, including state member banks: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components; (ii) comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account; (iii) take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned accounts; and (iv) perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act’s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. Synovus Bank has augmented its systems and procedures to meet the requirements of these regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures and controls to reflect changes required by law.

We have always had exposures to loans secured by CRE due to the nature of our markets and the loan needs of both retail and commercial customers. We believe our long-term experience in CRE lending, underwriting policies, internal controls, and other policies currently in place, as well as our loan and credit monitoring and administration procedures, are generally appropriate to managing our concentrations as required under the Guidance.",

Following the enactment of the GLB, CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual CRA reports must be made to a bank’s primary federal regulator. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become or remain a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under GLB may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a “satisfactory” CRA rating in its latest CRA examination.

Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to customers annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to comply with state law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than the GLB.

Use of such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V on a uniform, nationwide basis, including credit reporting, prescreening, and sharing of information between affiliates and the use of credit data. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act, permits states to enact identity theft laws that are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the provisions of that Act. Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused.

As a result, financial institutions, like Synovus and Synovus Bank, are expected to establish multiple lines of defense and to ensure their risk management processes address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution. A financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient processes to effectively respond and recover the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if a critical service provider of the institution falls victim to this type of cyber-attack. Our information security protocols are designed in part to adhere the requirements of this guidance.",

A bank may, however, offer combined-balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products.

The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years of the loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43%. While “qualified mortgages” will generally be afforded safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements will attach to “qualified mortgages” that are “higher priced mortgages” (which are generally subprime loans). In addition, the securitizer of asset-backed securities must retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities, unless subject to an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as “qualified residential mortgages.”",
        "The CFPB has also issued rules to implement requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act pertaining to mortgage loan origination (including with respect to loan originator compensation and loan originator qualifications) as well as integrated mortgage disclosure rules. In addition, the CFPB has issued rules that require servicers to comply with certain standards and practices with regard to: error correction; information disclosure; force-placement of insurance; information management policies and procedures; requiring information about mortgage loss mitigation options be provided to delinquent borrowers; providing delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower’s mortgage loan account; and evaluating borrowers’ applications for available loss mitigation options.

The costs of providing benefits and related funding requirements of these plans are subject to changes in the market value of the assets that fund the plans and the discount rates used to estimate the pension benefit obligations. The funded status of the plans and the related costs reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, particularly in the current economic environment. Future losses of asset values and further declines in discount rates may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans to meet minimum federal government requirements and may result in higher pension expense in future years. Adverse changes in the benefit obligations of our pension plans may require us to record higher pension expense and fund obligations earlier than originally planned, which would have an adverse impact on our cash flows from operations, decrease borrowing capacity and increase interest expense.",

A significant portion of our natural gas distribution, propane operations and natural gas transmission revenue is derived from the sales and deliveries to residential, commercial and industrial heating customers during the five-month peak heating season (November through March). Other than our Maryland natural gas distribution businesses (Maryland division, Sandpiper Energy and Elkton Gas) which have revenue normalization mechanisms, if the weather is warmer than normal, we sell and deliver less natural gas and propane to customers, and earn less revenue, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Likewise, if the weather is colder than normal, we sell and deliver more natural gas and propane to customers, and earn more revenue, which could positively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Variations in weather from year to year can cause our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition to vary accordingly. ",
        "Our electric distribution operation is also affected by variations in weather conditions and unusually severe weather conditions. However, electricity consumption is generally less seasonal than natural gas and propane because it is used for both heating and cooling in our service areas.",

Natural disasters and severe weather may damage our assets, cause operational interruptions and result in the loss of human life, all of which could negatively affect our earnings, financial condition and results of operations. Acts of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the United States and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in the price of natural gas, electricity and propane that could negatively affect our operations. Companies in the energy industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to acts of terrorism, which could affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The insurance industry may also be affected by natural disasters, severe weather and acts of terrorism; as a result, the availability of insurance covering risks against which we and our competitors typically insure may be limited.

Increases in the cost of natural gas and other fuels used to generate electricity can significantly increase the cost of electricity billed to our electric customers. Damage to the production or transportation facilities of our suppliers, which decreases their supply of natural gas and electricity, could result in increased supply costs and higher prices for our customers. Such cost increases generally have no immediate effect on our revenues and net income because of our regulated fuel cost recovery mechanisms. However, our net income may be reduced by higher expenses that we may incur for uncollectible customer accounts and by lower volumes of natural gas and electricity deliveries when customers reduce their consumption. Therefore, increases in the price of natural gas and other fuels can adversely affect our operating cash flows, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the competitiveness of natural gas and electricity as energy sources.",

Propane costs are subject to changes as a result of product supply or other market conditions, including weather, economic and political factors affecting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing. For example, weather conditions could damage production or transportation facilities, which could result in decreased supplies of propane, increased supply costs and higher prices for customers. Such increases in costs can occur rapidly and can negatively affect profitability. There is no assurance that we will be able to pass on propane cost increases fully or immediately, particularly when propane costs increase rapidly. Therefore, average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year-to-year as product costs fluctuate in response to propane, fuel oil, crude oil and natural gas commodity market conditions. In addition, in periods of sustained higher commodity prices, declines in retail sales volumes due to reduced consumption and increased amounts of uncollectible accounts may adversely affect net income.",

Although the specific form may vary, states that regulate horse racing generally do so through a horse racing commission or other gambling regulatory authority.  In general, regulatory authorities perform background checks on all racetrack owners prior to granting the necessary operating licenses.  Horse owners, trainers, jockeys, drivers, stewards, judges, and backstretch personnel are also subject to licensing by governmental authorities.

The results of the survey help us understand what is working well and our opportunities for improvement. In 2020, we only conducted one employee pulse survey as we also conducted a series of surveys throughout the year to help us manage our COVID-19 response. New for the 2020 survey were five questions related to Crawford’s response to the pandemic. Our overall response rate was 82% which was up from 76% in December of 2019. Favorable response rates increased across all five categories of questions; the way we execute; the way we lead; the way we manage; the way we see ourselves; and the way we work together. We are able to measure response rates through many data cuts including global service lines, geographies, shared services functions, and different demographic groups such as age, gender and tenure. Survey results are used to develop action plans for improvement. Key themes coming out of the survey results for 2020 include working hours, technology, training and communication. As a result, we are reviewing the future of work arrangements with our global reintegration teams, crafting a strategic digital plan, expanding our technical and management capabilities training, connecting with global employees with technology-enabled town hall meetings, sending regular communication updates from key members of the executive leadership team and continuing to provide a bi-weekly global employee health and safety updates.",

Our employees rely on our cloud-based digital work environment to communicate and access data that is necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. While these digital systems enable us to efficiently supply our natural gas and NGLs to the market, they are also susceptible to cyber security threats. Likewise, as a digitally-focused organization, we seek employees with a high degree of both technical skill and digital literacy, and it can be difficult to attract and retain personnel who satisfy these criteria. Further, we predominately operate in the Appalachia Basin, and a substantial majority of our midstream and water services are provided by one provider, EQM Midstream Partners, LP, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in one major geographic area and obtaining a substantial amount of our services from a single provider within that operating area.",

To the extent these services are delayed or unavailable, we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production. Access to midstream assets may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons. In addition, at current commodity prices, construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may occur more slowly. A lack of access to needed infrastructure, or an extended interruption of access to or service from third-party pipelines and facilities for any reason, including vandalism, terroristic acts, sabotage or cyber-attacks on such pipelines and facilities or service interruptions due to gas quality, could result in adverse consequences to us, such as delays in producing and selling our natural gas, NGLs and oil.",

Because these obligations involve significant long-term financial and other commitments on our part, they could reduce our cash flow during periods of low prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil when we may have lower volumes of natural gas and NGLs and therefore less of a need for capacity and storage, or the market prices for such pipeline and storage capacity services may be lower than what we are contractually obligated to pay to EQM. ",
        "Further, the Consolidated GGA provides for a reduced fee structure for the gathering and compression fees charged by EQM; however this new fee structure does not take effect until the Mountain Valley Pipeline's in-service date. There can be no assurance that the in-service date of the Mountain Valley Pipeline will not be delayed, or that the project will not be cancelled entirely, which would consequently delay, possibly indefinitely, the effective date of the fee reductions contemplated in the Consolidated GGA. Neither Equitrans Midstream nor EQM is under any obligation to renegotiate their contracts with us, including the Consolidated GGA, in the event of a prolonged depressed commodity price environment or if the Mountain Valley Pipeline's in-service date is delayed. We have recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet a contract asset of $410 million representing the estimated fair value of the rate relief provided by the Consolidated GGA that would be realized beginning with the Mountain Valley Pipeline’s in-service date. We review the contract asset for indications of impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Although the Consolidated GGA provides a cash payment option that grants us the right to receive payments from EQM in the event that the Mountain Valley Pipeline in-service date has not occurred prior to January 1, 2022, future delays in the Mountain Valley Pipeline’s in-service date may nonetheless affect our ability to fully realize the value we recorded as a contract asset for the rate relief associated with the Consolidated GGA, which could adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.

These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, challenged or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business. In addition, anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain operations, such as drilling and development.

In 2010, Congress adopted the Dodd-Frank Act, which established federal oversight and regulation of the OTC derivative market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act required the CFTC, the SEC and certain federal agencies that regulate the banking and insurance sectors (Prudential Regulators) to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the legislation. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivative activities. Although some of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act have yet to be adopted, the CFTC, the SEC and Prudential Regulators have issued numerous rules, including the End-User Exception, which exempts certain “end-users” from having to comply with mandatory clearing, a Margin Rule mandating margining for certain uncleared swaps, and a Position Limits Rule imposing federal position limits on certain futures contracts relating to energy products, including natural gas.",

We also qualify as a “non-financial end user” for purposes of the Margin Rule; therefore, our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements. Finally, although the Position Limits Rule does not go into effect with respect to energy products until January 1, 2022, we believe that the majority, if not all, of our hedging activities constitute bona fide hedging under the Position Limits Rule and will not be subject to the limitations under such rule. However, many of our hedge counterparties and other market participants are not eligible for the End-User Exception, are subject to mandatory clearing and the Margin Rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties, and may be subject to the Position Limits Rule, which may affect the pricing and/or availability of derivatives for us.

If our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, related regulations or the Foreign Regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile, and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for, and fund, our capital expenditure requirements.

At the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Some states and municipalities have sought to ban hydraulic fracturing altogether. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from constructing wells.

For example, in June 2015, the EPA and the Corps issued a final rule under the CWA defining the scope of the EPA's and the Corps' jurisdiction over WOTUS, which was stayed nationwide in October 2015 pending resolution of several legal challenges. The EPA and the Corps proposed a rule in July 2017 to repeal the WOTUS rule and announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the CWA's jurisdiction. In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction to hear challenges to the WOTUS rule resides with the federal district courts, which lifted the stay and resulted in a patchwork application of the rule in some states, but not in others. In October 2019, the EPA issued a final rule repealing the WOTUS rule and the repeal rule became effective in December 2019. In April 2020, the EPA and the Corps published the NWPR, which narrows the definition of WOTUS to four categories of jurisdictional waters and includes twelve categories of exclusions, including groundwater. A coalition of states and cities, environmental groups, and agricultural groups have challenged the NWPR and a federal district court in Colorado stayed implementation of the rule. The stay is limited to application of the rule in Colorado; the rule has taken effect in all other states. In addition, in an April 2020 decision defining the scope of the CWA that was handed down just days after the NWPR was published, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, in certain cases, discharges from a point source to groundwater could fall within the scope of the CWA and require a permit. The Court rejected the EPA and Corps’ assertion that groundwater should be totally excluded from the CWA. The Court’s decision is expected to bolster challenges to the NWPR. On January 20, 2021, the Biden Administration announced it will review the NWPR in accordance with the January 20, 2021 Executive Order that revokes President Trump’s Executive Order 13778, which required review and reversal of the WOTUS rule. The EPA and the Corps have requested to stay the litigation over the NWPR during the agencies’ review of the rule. To the extent a rule expands the scope of the CWA's jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. Such potential regulations or litigation could increase our operating costs, reduce our liquidity, delay or halt our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, which in turn could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Further, the discharges of natural gas, NGLs, oil, and other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties.",

The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in constraints on our exploration and production activities. This limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those months for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages.

        "In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish PSD construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \"best available control technology\" standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case‑by‑case basis. These EPA rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources.

At the state level, several states including Pennsylvania have proceeded with regulation targeting GHG emissions. Such state regulations could impose increased compliance costs on our operations.",
        "While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of federal legislation in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap-and-trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. In October 2019, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed an Executive Order directing the PADEP to draft regulations establishing a cap-and-trade program under its existing authority to regulate air emissions, with the intent of enabling Pennsylvania to join the RGGI, a multi-state regional cap-and-trade program comprised of several Eastern U.S. states. In September 2020, the Pennsylvania Environmental Quality Board approved promulgation of the RGGI regulation, and a public comment period and hearings regarding the regulation commenced at the end of 2020. Based on the current timeline for implementation, final rulemaking is expected to be sent to the Pennsylvania Environmental Quality Board for review and approval in the fourth quarter of 2021, with the first year of compliance anticipated to begin in 2022. Assuming Pennsylvania ultimately becomes a member of the RGGI in 2022, as currently anticipated, it will result in increased operating costs if we are required to purchase emission allowances in connection with our operations.",
        "On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to the Paris Agreement, which calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. The Paris Agreement was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force on November 4, 2016; however, the Paris Agreement does not impose any binding obligations on its participants. In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the United States' intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, with such withdrawal becoming effective in November 2020. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued written notification to the United Nations of the United States’ intention to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which will become effective in 30 days from such date.",
        "Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could also adversely affect demand for the natural gas, NGLs and oil we produce and lower the value of our reserves.",
        "Further, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Moreover, activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbon-intensive activities. While we cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals, they could ultimately make it more difficult to engage in exploration and production activities.",
        "Finally, it should be noted that a number of scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts, and other extreme climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they have the potential to cause physical damage to our assets or affect the availability of water and thus could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.

These factors include estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, operating costs, production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities. These assessments are complex and inherently imprecise. Our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties. We do not inspect every well or lease that we acquire, and even when we inspect a well or lease we may not discover structural, subsurface, or environmental problems that may exist or arise.",
        "There may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.

However, third parties, including governmental agencies, could seek to hold us responsible for obligations and liabilities that Equitrans Midstream agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from Equitrans Midstream will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such obligations and liabilities, or that Equitrans Midstream will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Additionally, if a court were to determine that the Separation or related transactions were consummated with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or resulted in Equitrans Midstream receiving less than reasonably equivalent value when it was insolvent, or that it was rendered insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due, then it is possible that the court could disregard the allocation of obligations and liabilities agreed to between us and Equitrans Midstream, impose substantial obligations and liabilities on us and void some or all of the Separation-related transactions. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.",

Additionally, the Bancorp adopted in 2019 a footprint-wide ban on salary history (by not asking for or using an applicant’s current salary as a factor in an employment offer) to immediately reduce historical gender or racial pay inequities.  ",
        "To strengthen a sense of belonging for all employees, the Bancorp operates a number of inclusion councils at both enterprise and regional levels, as well as local Business Resource Groups (BRGs) in the following categories: African American, Asian & Pacific Islander, Individuals with Disabilities, Latino, LGBTQ+, Military, Women’s and Young Professionals. Senior executives led eight virtual Enterprise BRGs in 2020 that enabled all employees to participate regardless of their work location—greatly expanding access for employees. In 2020, the Bancorp also launched a new Executive Diversity Leadership Council that is currently charged to develop and deliver strategic short- and long-term solutions to advance our diversity efforts relating to Black employees, communities and customers.

The Bancorp’s Board of Directors and executive management oversee employee engagement on a regular basis by collecting employee feedback, primarily through employee viewpoints surveys. As further discussed later in this section, the Bancorp performed additional surveys in 2020 in response to the challenges of remote work and the COVID-19 pandemic. ",

        "The Bancorp is committed to providing competitive compensation and benefits programs that reward employees for delivering the right products to the right customers, in ways that consider shareholders’ long-term interests, while also staying within the Bancorp’s risk tolerance. These programs include an $18 per hour minimum wage, a 401(k) retirement program that pays a match up to 7% of an employee’s compensation and other traditional benefits. The Bancorp also offers parental bonding leave, and several other health, wellness and financial benefits programs and services that assist employees in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. ",

        "The Bancorp took significant measures to provide employees with a sense of safety, security and certainty in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 50% of employees were transitioned to remote work, supported through enhanced technology solutions, revised hiring and onboarding programs and increased communication. The Bancorp also rewarded specific employees who provided front-line, essential banking services during the pandemic with special one-time payments of up to $1,000.",
        "To protect the health and safety of employees and customers and consistent with CDC, state and local guidance, Fifth Third established social distancing, hygiene and environmental safety protocols for on-site workers at the Bancorp’s banking centers and offices. The Bancorp also provided free COVID-19 testing for employees enrolled in Fifth Third’s medical coverage, provided backup child care solutions to address evolving needs and increased paid time away (including mid-year replenishment of sick days, providing additional vacation days to eligible employees to use in 2021 and reimbursing employees for unused vacation time in certain situations). The Bancorp also developed tracking and reporting solutions to monitor employee health and work situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The Bancorp evaluates strategic acquisition and investment opportunities and conducts due diligence activities in connection with possible transactions. As a result, discussions, and in some cases, negotiations regarding acquisitions and investments may take place and future transactions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur. These typically involve the payment of a premium over book value and current market price, and therefore, some dilution of book value and net income per share may occur with any future transactions.",
        "Regulation and Supervision",
        "In addition to the generally applicable state and federal laws governing businesses and employers, the Bancorp and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their parent companies. Virtually all aspects of the business of the Bancorp and the Bank are subject to specific requirements or restrictions and general regulatory oversight. The principal objectives of state and federal banking laws and regulations and the supervision, regulation and examination of banks and their parent companies (such as the Bank and the Bancorp) by bank regulatory agencies are the maintenance of the safety and soundness of financial institutions, the maintenance of the federal deposit insurance system and the protection of consumers or classes of consumers, rather than the protection of shareholders or debtholders of a bank or the parent company of a bank. The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to an extensive regulatory framework of complex and comprehensive federal and state laws and regulations addressing the provision of banking and other financial services and other aspects of the Bancorp’s businesses and operations.

        "Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which the Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject increased in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors, such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of Dodd-Frank and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. While the regulatory environment has recently been in a period of rebalancing the post financial crisis framework, the Bancorp expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision. It is possible that the intensity of regulation and supervision will be higher in the Biden Administration.",
        "On May 24, 2018, the EGRRCPA was signed into law. Among other regulatory changes, the EGRRCPA amends various sections of  Dodd-Frank, including section 165, which was revised to raise the asset thresholds for determining the application of enhanced prudential standards for BHCs. The EGRRCPA’s increased asset thresholds took effect immediately for BHCs with total consolidated assets less than $100 billion, with the exception of risk committee requirements, which now apply to publicly-traded BHCs with $50 billion or more of consolidated assets. BHCs with consolidated assets between $100 billion and $250 billion, including the Bancorp, were subject to the enhanced prudential standards that applied to them before enactment of EGRRCPA until December 31, 2019, when rules adopted by the FRB that tailor the applicability of enhanced prudential standards and capital and liquidity requirements for BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets became effective, as described in detail below.",
        "On October 10, 2019, the FRB adopted a rule that adjusts the thresholds at which certain enhanced prudential standards (“EPS”) apply to BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets (the “EPS Tailoring Rule”) and the FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) and FDIC adopted a rule that similarly adjusts the thresholds at which certain other capital and liquidity standards apply to BHCs and banks with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets (the “Capital and Liquidity Tailoring Rule” and, together with the EPS Tailoring Rule, the “Tailoring Rules”). The Tailoring Rules establish four risk-based categories of institutions, and the extent to which enhanced prudential standards and certain other capital and liquidity standards apply to these BHCs and banks depends on the banking organization’s category. Under the Tailoring Rules, the Bancorp and the Bank each qualify as a Category IV banking organization subject to the least restrictive of the requirements applicable to firms with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets.",

The Bancorp is also subject to regulation by the SEC by virtue of its status as a public company and due to the nature of some of its businesses. The Bank is also subject to regulation by the FDIC, which insures the Bank’s deposits as permitted by law.",
        "The federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to banks and to BHCs regulate, among other matters, the scope of the Bancorp’s and the Bank’s businesses, their activities, their investments, their capital and liquidity levels, their ability to make capital distributions (such as share repurchases and dividends), their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, the amount of loans to individual and related borrowers and the nature, the amount of and collateral for certain loans, and the amount of interest that may be charged on loans, as applicable.

The FRB, the OCC and the CFPB have the authority to issue orders for BHCs and banks to cease and desist from certain banking practices and violations of conditions imposed by, or violations of agreements with, the FRB, the OCC and the CFPB. Certain of the Bancorp’s and the Bank’s regulators are also empowered to assess civil money penalties against companies or individuals in certain situations, such as when there is a violation of a law or regulation. Applicable state and federal laws also grant certain regulators the authority to impose additional requirements and restrictions on the activities of the Bancorp and the Bank and, in some situations, the imposition of such additional requirements and restrictions will not be publicly available information.",

        "The Bancorp is registered as a BHC with the FRB under the BHCA and qualifies for and has elected to become an FHC. An FHC is permitted to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a BHC under the BHCA. Permitted activities for an FHC include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking and other activities that are declared by the FRB, in cooperation with the Treasury Department, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or are declared by the FRB unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities. In addition, an FHC is allowed to conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible non-bank financial companies with after-the-fact notice to the FRB. A BHC may elect to become an FHC if the BHC is well-capitalized and is well managed and each of its banking subsidiaries is well-capitalized, is well managed and has at least a “Satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”). To maintain FHC status, a BHC must continue to meet these requirements. The failure to meet such requirements could result in material restrictions on the activities of the FHC and may also adversely affect the FHC’s ability to enter into certain transactions (including mergers and acquisitions) or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith, as well as loss of FHC status. If restrictions are imposed on the activities of an FHC, such information may not necessarily be available to the public.",
        "Dividends",
        "The Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries and depends in part upon dividends received from its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including the Bank, to fund its activities, including its ability to make capital distributions, such as paying dividends or repurchasing shares. Under federal law, there are various limitations on the extent to which the Bank can declare and pay dividends to the Bancorp, including those related to regulatory capital requirements, general regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices, and federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits, surplus, and available earnings. Certain contractual restrictions also may limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Bancorp. No assurances can be given that the Bank will, in any circumstances, pay dividends to the Bancorp.",
        "The Bancorp’s ability to declare and pay dividends is similarly limited by federal banking law and FRB regulations and policy. The FRB has authority to prohibit BHCs from making capital distributions if they would be deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The FRB has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for BHCs to pay dividends unless a BHC’s net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, the Bancorp’s ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends and repurchasing shares, is subject to the Bancorp complying with the automatic restrictions on capital distributions under the FRBs capital rules (“CCAR”) process discussed below (see Regulatory Capital Requirements below).",
        "In response to the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, certain large BHCs, including the Bancorp, were not permitted to make share repurchases, subject to certain limited exceptions, during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, but were permitted to make dividend payments subject to limits based on the amount of dividends paid in the second quarter and the firm’s average net income for the four preceding quarters. For the first quarter of 2021, provided that a BHC does not increase its common stock dividends higher than the level paid in the second quarter of 2020, BHCs, including the Bancorp, are permitted to pay common dividends and make share repurchases that, in the aggregate, do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. BHCs may also make additional share repurchases up to the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation. For further information on a subsequent event related to an accelerated share repurchase transaction, refer to Note 33 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ",
        "Source of Strength",
        "A BHC, including the Bancorp, is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries and to commit resources to their support. This support may be required at times when the BHC may not have the resources to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of the Bancorp or its shareholders or creditors. The FRB may require a BHC to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the BHC with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the BHC fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the FRB believes might jeopardize the BHC’s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank.",
        "Under these requirements, the Bancorp may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress. Capital loans by the Bancorp to the Bank would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the Bank. In the event of the Bancorp’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Bancorp to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.",

The FDIC, as required under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, established a plan on September 15, 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed 1.35% within eight years. The FDIC’s restoration plan projects the reserve ratio to exceed 1.35% without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rate, subject to ongoing monitoring over the next eight years. The FDIC could increase the deposit insurance assessments for certain insured depository institutions, including the Bank, if the DIF reserve ratio is not restored as projected.",
        "Transactions with Affiliates",
        "Federal banking laws restrict transactions between a bank and its affiliates, including a parent BHC. The Bank is subject to these restrictions, which include quantitative and qualitative limits on the amounts and types of transactions that may take place, including extensions of credit to affiliates, investments in the stock or securities of affiliates, purchases of assets from affiliates and certain other transactions with affiliates. These restrictions also require that credit transactions with affiliates be collateralized and that transactions with affiliates be on market terms or better for the bank. Generally, a bank’s covered transactions with any affiliate are limited to 10% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus and covered transactions with all affiliates are limited to 20% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus. Dodd-Frank expanded the scope of these regulations, including by applying them to the credit exposure arising under derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions. Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by FDIC-insured banks, such as the Bank, and their subsidiaries to their directors, executive officers, and principal shareholders.",
        "Community Reinvestment Act",
        "The CRA generally requires insured depository institutions, including the Bank, to identify the communities they serve and to make loans and investments and provide services that meet the credit needs of those communities. The CRA requires the OCC to evaluate the performance of national banks (including the Bank) with respect to these CRA obligations. Depository institutions must maintain comprehensive records of their CRA activities for purposes of these examinations. The OCC must take into account the institution’s record of performance in meeting the credit needs of the entire community served, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods. For purposes of CRA examinations, the OCC rates each institution’s compliance with the CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” The FRB, which was responsible for CRA evaluations of the Bank prior to its conversion to a national bank charter, conducted a regularly scheduled examination covering 2014 through 2016 to determine the Bank’s compliance with the CRA. This CRA examination resulted in a change in rating from “Needs to Improve” to “Outstanding.”",
        "The CRA requires the relevant federal bank regulatory agency to consider a bank’s CRA assessment when considering the bank’s application to conduct certain mergers or acquisitions or to open or relocate a branch office. The FRB also must consider the CRA record of each subsidiary bank of a BHC in connection with any acquisition or merger application filed by the BHC. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay or result in the denial of an approval or application by the Bancorp or the Bank.",
        "In May 2020, the OCC finalized amendments to its CRA rules, which apply to national banks, including the Bank. The OCC’s final rule clarifies and expands the types of activities that qualify for positive CRA consideration, updates how banks determine assessment areas in which they are evaluated, establishes objective performance standards to evaluate CRA performance and imposes more comprehensive CRA-related data collection and reporting requirements. The Bank must comply with most of these amended requirements by January 1, 2023. ",
        "The other federal banking agencies, the FDIC and FRB, are also in the process of proposing amendments to their respective CRA rules.  While FDIC and FRB CRA rules do not apply to the Bank, future rulemaking to harmonize the CRA rules of the three federal banking agencies could result in changes to CRA requirements applicable to national banks, including the Bank.",

        "The Bancorp and the Bank are subject to certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements under the capital adequacy rules (the “Final Capital Rules”) adopted by the FRB, for the Bancorp, and by the OCC, for the Bank. These quantitative calculations are minimums, and the FRB and OCC may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on the Bancorp’s operations or financial condition. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Bancorp’s or the Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications.

In the first quarter of 2015, under the Final Capital Rules, the Bancorp made a one-time election to exclude certain AOCI components, with the result that those components are not recognized in the Bancorp’s CET1. In July 2019, the FDIC, the FRB and the OCC issued final rules for institutions that do not apply advanced approaches to regulatory capital, including the Bancorp and the Bank. These rules simplified the capital treatment of certain items (including mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions) and simplified the recognition and calculation of minority interests that are includable in regulatory capital. The advanced approaches to regulatory capital are generally required for large, internationally active banking organizations including those designated as global systemically important bank holding companies and those with total assets or cross-jurisdictional activity in excess of certain thresholds.

        "In August 2020, the U.S. federal banking agencies adopted a final rule altering the definition of eligible retained income in their respective capital rules.  Under the new rule, eligible retained income is the greater of a firm’s (i) net income for the four preceding calendar quarters, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income, and (ii) average net income over the preceding four quarters. An institution's eligible retained income, when considered in conjunction with capital ratios and the stress capital buffer, provides limitations on capital distributions (including dividends and share repurchases) and certain executive compensation arrangements for the quarter following the calculation. As of December 31, 2020, the Bancorp was permitted to use 100% of its eligible retained income for these purposes in the first quarter of 2021. This definition applies with respect to all of the Bancorp’s capital requirements. In addition, in December 2018, the U.S. federal banking agencies finalized rules that would permit BHCs and banks to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of ASU 2016-13  (“CECL”) on retained earnings over a period of three years. As part of their response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued another final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations that adopt CECL in the 2020 calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by the aforementioned three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial two-year delay for a total five-year transition. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (modified CECL transitional amount) is calculated as the sum of the day-one impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (CECL transitional amount) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the day-one ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The modified CECL transitional amount will be calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. The amount of the modified CECL transition amount will be fixed as of December 31, 2021 and that amount will be subject to the three-year phase out. For further discussion of CECL, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.",

If the FRB were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to BHCs as that applicable to the Bank, the Bancorp’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2020, would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard.

        "Capital Planning and Stress Testing",
        "BHCs with $100 billion or more in consolidated assets, including the Bancorp, generally must submit capital plans to the FRB on an annual basis. In March 2020, the FRB adopted a final rule to integrate the annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirements for large BHCs. As a result, the FRB’s annual CCAR process is now used to calibrate the Bancorp’s stress capital buffer requirement. Among other changes, the revised capital plan rule also eliminates the assumption that the Bancorp’s balance sheet assets would increase over the planning horizon. In addition, provided that the Bancorp is otherwise in compliance with automatic restrictions on distributions under the Final Capital Rules, the Bancorp will no longer be required to seek prior approval to make capital distributions in excess of those included in its capital plan. The Bancorp is required to provide the FRB notice within 15 days after making any capital distributions in excess of those included in its capital plan.",
        "Under its CCAR process, the FRB annually evaluates capital adequacy, internal capital adequacy, assessment processes and capital distribution plans of BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The CCAR process is intended to help ensure that those BHCs have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for each company’s unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. The mandatory elements of the capital plan are an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over a nine-quarter planning horizon, a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon, a discussion of any expected changes to the BHC’s business plan that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy or liquidity, a detailed description of the BHC’s process for assessing capital adequacy and the BHC’s capital policy.",
        "As a result of the EPS Tailoring Rule, the Bancorp is subject to a quantitative assessment of capital through supervisory stress tests every two years, with the next required submission due in 2022. These supervisory stress tests are forward-looking quantitative evaluations of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on the Bancorp's capital. Additionally, under the EPS Tailoring Rule, the Bancorp is no longer required to file semi-annual, company-run stress tests with the FRB and publicly disclose the results.",
        "Stress Buffer Requirements",
        "In March 2020, the FRB issued a final rule amending regulatory capital rules, capital plan rules and stress test rules. Under the final rule, the capital conservation buffer is replaced with a stress capital buffer requirement. During each supervisory stress testing cycle, the FRB will use the Bancorp’s supervisory stress test to determine its stress capital buffer, subject to a floor of 2.5%. Similar to the capital conservation buffer, the Bancorp must maintain capital ratios above the sum of its minimum risk-based capital ratios and the stress capital buffer to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The final rule is applicable to BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets and was effective on October 1, 2020. The FRB provided the Bancorp with a stress capital buffer of 2.5% that was effective as of October 1, 2020. The FRB required large banking organizations, including the Bancorp, to resubmit their capital plans to reflect the stresses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the FRB will notify the Bancorp by March 31, 2021 if it will elect to recalculate the Bancorp’s stress capital buffer requirement.",

As compared to enhanced prudential standards that were applicable to the Bancorp, under the EPS Tailoring Rule, the Bancorp is no longer subject to company-run stress testing requirements and is subject to less frequent supervisory stress tests, less frequent internal liquidity stress tests, and reduced liquidity risk management requirements.",
        "Heightened Governance and Risk Management Standards",
        "The OCC has published guidelines documenting expectations for the governance and risk management practices of certain large financial institutions, including the Bank. The guidelines require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risk-taking activities. In addition, the guidelines provide standards for the institutions’ boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework. The Bank currently has a written governance framework and associated controls.",

The Guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. In addition, various U.S. regulators, including the OCC, FRB and the SEC, have increased their focus on cyber security through guidance, examinations and regulations. The Bancorp has adopted a customer information security program that has been approved by the Bancorp’s Board of Directors.",
        "The GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, the statute requires explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibits disclosing such information except as provided in the banking subsidiary’s policies and procedures. The Bancorp’s banking subsidiary has implemented a privacy policy.",

Moreover, these laws, and proposed legislation, are still subject to revision or formal guidance and they may be interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our understanding.",
        "Like other lenders, the Bank and other of the Bancorp’s subsidiaries use credit bureau data in their underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), and the FCRA also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus, prescreening individuals for credit offers, sharing of information between affiliates, and using affiliate data for marketing purposes. Similar state laws may impose additional requirements on the Bancorp and its subsidiaries.",
        "Anti-Money Laundering and  Economic Sanctions",
        "The Bancorp is subject to federal laws that are designed to counter money laundering and terrorist financing, and transactions with persons, companies or foreign governments sanctioned by the United States. These include the Bank Secrecy Act, the Money Laundering Control Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and regulations for the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act, as administered by the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. These laws obligate depository institutions and broker-dealers to verify their customers’ identity, conduct customer due diligence, report on suspicious activity, file reports of transactions in currency and conduct enhanced due diligence on certain accounts. They also prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with certain designated restricted countries and persons. Depository institutions and broker-dealers are required by their federal regulators to maintain robust policies and procedures in order to ensure compliance with these obligations.",
        "Failure to comply with these laws or maintain an adequate compliance program can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage and federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a proposed bank merger, acquisition, restructuring, or other expansionary activity. There have been a number of significant enforcement actions by regulators, as well as state attorneys general and the Department of Justice, against banks, broker-dealers and non-bank financial institutions with respect to these laws and some have resulted in substantial penalties, including criminal pleas. The Bancorp’s Board has approved policies and procedures that the Bancorp believes comply with these laws.",

        "The SEC’s rules also direct the stock exchanges to prohibit listing classes of equity securities of a company if a company’s compensation committee members are not independent. The rules also provide that a company’s compensation committee may only select a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisor after taking into consideration factors to be identified by the SEC that affect the independence of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisor.",
        "The rules implementing the pay ratio provisions of Dodd-Frank require companies to disclose the ratio of the compensation of its chief executive officer to the median compensation of its employees. For a registrant with a fiscal year ending on December 31, such as the Bancorp, the pay ratio was first required as part of its executive compensation disclosure in its annual proxy statement or Form 10-K filed starting in 2018.",
        "Dodd-Frank provides that the SEC must issue rules directing the stock exchanges to prohibit listing any security of a company unless the company develops and implements a policy providing for disclosure of the policy of the company on incentive-based compensation that is based on financial information required to be reported under the securities laws. In the event the company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the company will recover from any current or former executive officer of the company who received incentive-based compensation during the three-year period preceding the date on which the company is required to prepare the restatement based on the erroneous data, any exceptional compensation above what would have been paid under the restatement.",
        "Dodd-Frank required the SEC to adopt a rule to require that each company disclose in the proxy materials for its annual meetings whether an employee or board member is permitted to purchase financial instruments designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of equity securities granted as compensation or otherwise held by the employee or board member. The SEC adopted final rules requiring this disclosure on December 18, 2018. The Bancorp was required to comply with this new rule beginning July 1, 2019.",
        "The Bancorp’s compensation practices are also subject to oversight by the FRB. The scope and content of compensation regulation in the financial industry are continuing to develop, and the regulations and resulting market practices are expected to continue to evolve over a number of years. In June 2016, the SEC and the federal banking agencies issued a proposed rule to implement the incentive-based compensation provisions of section 956 of Dodd-Frank. The proposal would establish new requirements for incentive-based compensation at institutions with assets of at least $1 billion. No final rule has been issued, but the Biden Administration may revisit this proposal.",
        "Debit Card Interchange Fees",
        "Dodd-Frank includes a set of rules requiring that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be reasonable and proportional to certain costs associated with processing the transactions. Interchange fees for electronic debit transactions are limited to 21 cents plus 0.05% of the transaction, plus an additional one cent per transaction fraud adjustment. These fees impose requirements regarding routing and exclusivity of electronic debit transactions, and generally require that debit cards be usable in at least two unaffiliated networks.",
        "Resolution Planning",
        "In past years, the Bancorp was required to submit annually to the FRB and the FDIC a resolution plan for the orderly resolution of the Bancorp and its significant legal entities under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other applicable insolvency laws in a rapid and orderly fashion in the event of future material financial distress or failure. In October 2019, the FRB and the FDIC adopted amendments to their resolution planning rule to adjust the thresholds at which certain resolution planning requirements apply to BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including the Bancorp. As a result of these amendments, the Bancorp is no longer required to submit an annual resolution plan to the FRB and the FDIC.",
        "In addition, the Bank is required to periodically file a separate resolution plan with the FDIC. EGRRCPA did not change the FDIC’s rules that require the Bank to periodically file a separate resolution plan. In April 2019, the FDIC released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the FDIC’s bank resolution plan requirements that requested comments on how to better tailor bank resolution plans to a firm’s size, complexity, and risk profile. Until the FDIC’s revisions to its bank resolution plan requirement are finalized, no bank resolution plans will be required to be filed.",

        "Dodd-Frank sets forth restrictions on banking organizations’ ability to engage in proprietary trading and to have certain ownership interests in and relationships with certain covered funds, such as private equity and hedge funds (the “Volcker Rule”). The Volcker Rule generally prohibits any banking entity from engaging in short-term proprietary trading for its own account, but permits transactions in certain securities (such as securities of the U.S. government), transactions on behalf of customers and activities such as market making, underwriting and risk-mitigating hedging.

The Bancorp is also required to maintain a satisfactory Volcker Rule compliance program.",

These amendments tailor the Volcker Rule’s compliance requirements to the amount of a firm’s trading activity, revise the definition of trading account, clarify certain key provisions in the Volcker Rule, and modify the information companies are required to provide to federal agencies. These amendments to the Volcker Rule are not material to our investing and trading activities.",
        "In June 2020, the five federal agencies finalized amendments to the Volcker Rule’s restrictions on ownership interests in and relationships with covered funds. Among other things, these amendments permit banking entities to have relationships with and offer additional financial services to additional types of funds and investment vehicles.

The CFTC and U.S. banking regulators have finalized most rules applicable to the over-the-counter derivatives markets and swap dealers, and the SEC has finalized most of its rules related to security-based swaps. The CFTC’s Title VII regulations are applicable to the Bank’s activity as a swap dealer and include rules related to internal and external business conduct standards, reporting and recordkeeping, mandatory clearing for certain swaps, and trade documentation and confirmation requirements. In addition, the U.S. banking regulators have finalized regulations applicable to the Bank regarding mandatory posting and collection of margin by certain swap counterparties and segregation of customer funds.

State authorities have increased their focus on and enforcement of consumer protection rules. These federal and state consumer protection laws apply to a broad range of our activities and to various aspects of our business and include laws relating to interest rates, fair lending, disclosures of credit terms and estimated transaction costs to consumer borrowers, debt collection practices, the use of and the provision of information to consumer reporting agencies, and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale, or provision of consumer financial products and services.",

These laws (and the regulations promulgated thereunder) are primarily intended to protect depositors and the deposit insurance fund (the “DIF”) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC. The following information describes particular laws and regulatory provisions relating to financial holding companies and banks. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular laws and regulatory provisions. A change in any of these laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and the business of our subsidiaries. Recent political developments, including the change in administration of the United States federal government, have added additional uncertainty in the implementation, scope and timing of regulatory reforms.  Bank Holding Companies and Financial Holding Companies  Historically, the activities of bank holding companies were limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking. Bank holding companies were generally prohibited from acquiring control of any company that was not a bank and from engaging in any business other than the business of banking or managing and controlling banks. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which took effect on March 12, 2000, dismantled many Depression-era restrictions against affiliations between banking, securities and insurance firms by permitting bank holding companies to engage in a broader range of financial activities, so long as certain safeguards are observed. Specifically, bank holding companies may elect to become “financial holding companies” that may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. Thus, with the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, banks, security firms and insurance companies find it easier to acquire or affiliate with each other and cross-sell financial products. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act permits a single financial services organization to offer a more complete array of financial products and services than historically was permitted.  A financial holding company is essentially a bank holding company with significantly expanded powers. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, in addition to traditional lending activities, the following activities are among those that are deemed “financial in nature” for financial holding companies: securities underwriting, dealing in or making a market in securities, sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance underwriting and agency activities, activities which the Federal Reserve Board determines to be closely related to banking, and certain merchant banking activities.  We elected to become a financial holding company in September 2001. As a financial holding company, we have very broad discretion to affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies, provide merchant banking services, and engage in other activities that the Federal Reserve Board has deemed financial in nature. In order to continue as a financial holding company, we must continue to be well-capitalized, well-managed and maintain compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. Depending on the types of financial activities that we may elect to engage in, under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act’s functional regulation principles, we may become subject to supervision by additional government agencies. The election to be treated as a financial holding company increases our ability to offer financial products and services that historically we were either unable to provide or were only able to provide on a limited basis. As a result, we will face increased competition in the markets for any new financial products and services that we may offer. Likewise, an increased amount of consolidation among banks and securities firms or banks and insurance firms could result in a growing number of large financial institutions that could compete aggressively with us.    10   ",

We elected to become a financial holding company in September 2001. As a financial holding company, we have very broad discretion to affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies, provide merchant banking services, and engage in other activities that the Federal Reserve Board has deemed financial in nature. In order to continue as a financial holding company, we must continue to be well-capitalized, well-managed and maintain compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. Depending on the types of financial activities that we may elect to engage in, under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act’s functional regulation principles, we may become subject to supervision by additional government agencies. The election to be treated as a financial holding company increases our ability to offer financial products and services that historically we were either unable to provide or were only able to provide on a limited basis. As a result, we will face increased competition in the markets for any new financial products and services that we may offer. Likewise, an increased amount of consolidation among banks and securities firms or banks and insurance firms could result in a growing number of large financial institutions that could compete aggressively with us.    10  ",

Consequently, FHI and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision, regulation, examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The BHC Act provides generally for “umbrella” regulation of bank holding companies by the Federal Reserve and functional regulation of holding company subsidiaries by applicable regulatory agencies. The BHC Act, however, authorizes the Federal Reserve to examine any subsidiary of a bank holding company, other than a depository institution, engaged in activities permissible for a depository institution. The Federal Reserve is also granted the authority, in certain circumstances, to require reports of, examine and adopt rules applicable to any holding company subsidiary.",
        "In general, the BHC Act limits the activities permissible for bank holding companies. Bank holding companies electing to be treated as financial holding companies, however, may engage in additional activities under the BHC Act as described below under “— Permissible Activities under the BHC Act”. For a bank holding company to be eligible to elect financial holding company status, all of its subsidiary insured depository institutions must be well-capitalized and well-managed as described below under “— Prompt Corrective Action Framework” and must have received at least a “satisfactory rating” on such institution’s most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”). The bank holding company itself must also be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to be eligible to elect financial holding company status. If a financial holding company fails to continue to meet any of the well-capitalized and well-managed prerequisites for financial holding company status after engaging in activities not permissible for bank holding companies that have not elected to be treated as financial holding companies, the company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may be required to discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company. In addition, if any insured depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company fails to maintain a CRA rating of at least “Satisfactory,” the financial holding company will be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions.",

        "The Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (“EGRRCPA”), directs the Federal Reserve to monitor emerging risks to financial stability and enact enhanced supervision and prudential standards. As a bank holding company with less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, the Dodd-Frank Act’s enhanced prudential standards are not applicable to FHI. Prior to the passage of the EGRRCPA, the Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve rules required publicly traded bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets to establish risk committees. FHI established a risk committee in accordance with this requirement. In October 2019, the Federal Reserve adopted a rule that tailors the application of the enhanced prudential standards to BHCs per the EGRRCPA amendments, including by raising the asset threshold for application of many of these standards. Pursuant to the final rule, publicly traded bank holding companies with between $10 billion and $50 billion of total consolidated assets, including FHI, are no longer required to maintain a risk committee. However, FHI has determined that it will retain its risk committee. For bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, the applicability of the enhanced prudential standards depends on their “category,” as determined under the October 2019 tailoring rules.",
        "Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies",
        "The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, the Hawaii Code and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of banks and other FDIC-insured depository institutions. The Company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company, if after such acquisition, it will directly or indirectly own or control 5% or more of any class of voting shares of the institution, (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank (other than directly through the Bank) or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the FDIC is required for the Bank to merge with another bank or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or assume any of the deposits of another FDIC-insured depository institution. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, bank regulators consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position and managerial resources of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the CRA, the applicant’s compliance with applicable laws, including fair housing and other consumer protection laws and the effectiveness of all organizations involved in combating money laundering activities. In addition, failure to implement or maintain adequate compliance programs could cause bank regulators not to approve an acquisition where regulatory approval is required or to prohibit an acquisition even if approval is not required. In addition, the Federal Reserve will consider the extent to which a proposed transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. Under applicable laws, the Company may not be permitted to acquire any bank in Hawaii because it controls more than 30% of the total amount of deposits in the Hawaii market. As a result, any further growth in the Hawaii market will most likely have to occur organically rather than by acquisition.",

Virtually all of FHI’s income comes from dividends from the Bank, which is also the primary source of FHI’s liquidity and funds to pay dividends on its equity and, if FHI were to incur debt in the future, interest and principal on its debt. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank to FHI, as well as by FHI to its stockholders.",
        "Federal bank regulators are authorized to determine, under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. In particular, federal bank regulators have stated that paying dividends that deplete a banking organization’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In addition, the ability of banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends, and the contents of their respective dividend policies, could be impacted by a range of regulatory changes.",

        "Table of Contents",
        "Payment of Dividends by the Bank. In addition to the restrictions discussed above, the Bank is subject to limitations under Hawaii law regarding the amount of dividends that it may pay to the Parent. In general, under Hawaii law, dividends from a bank may not exceed the bank’s retained earnings provided that the bank will, after the dividend, have the minimum paid-in common stock and additional paid-in capital required under Hawaii law, which, for a bank which has trust operations, is $6.5 million. Hawaii law also effectively restricts a bank from paying a dividend, or the amount of the dividend, unless that bank’s common stock and additional paid-in capital is $6.5 million multiplied by 133%, or $8.6 million. This amount is not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be paid or available to be paid in future periods. Under Hawaii banking law, for example, paying “excessive dividends” in relation to a bank’s capital position, earnings capacity and asset quality could be deemed to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Hawaii Business Corporation Act, a dividend or other distribution may not be made if a bank would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of business or if its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities and the amounts that would be needed to satisfy shareholders with preferential rights of distribution. In addition, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950 (“FDIA”), an insured institution may not pay a dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. See “— Prompt Corrective Action Framework” below.",
        "Payment of Dividends and Common Stock Repurchases by the Company. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve. In particular, the dividend policies and share repurchases of the Company are reviewed by the Federal Reserve and will be assessed against, among other things, the Company’s ability to achieve the required capital ratios under applicable capital rules (including the applicable capital conservation buffer). In addition, the Federal Reserve has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bank holding companies to pay dividends unless a bank holding company’s net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Federal Reserve guidance also indicates that declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period (e.g., quarterly) for which the dividend is being paid could raise supervisory concerns.  See “— Regulatory Capital Requirements” below.",

        "Transactions between the Bank and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company or any other affiliate of the Company, on the other hand, are regulated under federal banking law. The Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative and qualitative requirements and collateral requirements on “covered transactions” by the Bank with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates, and generally requires those transactions to be on terms at least as favorable to the Bank as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third party. Covered transactions are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate, and credit exposure arising under derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions. In general, any such transaction by the Bank or its subsidiaries must be limited to certain thresholds on an individual and aggregate basis and, for credit transactions with any affiliate, must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral.",
        "Federal law also limits a bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers, principal shareholders (and persons that beneficially own or control more than 10% of any class of the bank’s voting stock), as well as to entities owned or controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to such insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with non-insiders. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of non-repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons individually and in the aggregate. Certain extensions of credit also require the approval of the Bank’s board of directors.",

In addition, any capital loans the Company makes to the Bank are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of the Bank.

The bank regulators currently use a combination of risk-based ratios and a leverage ratio to evaluate capital adequacy. The Company and the Bank are subject to the federal bank regulators’ final rules implementing Basel III and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Capital Rules”). ",
        "The Capital Rules, among other things, impose a capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”), to which most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital must be made. In addition, the Capital Rules specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain specified requirements.",

        "The Capital Rules also require a 2.5% capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer is composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) 7% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and (iii) 10.5% total capital to risk-weighted assets.",
        "Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and certain discretionary compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” (since March 2020, defined as the greater of (i) net income for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income; and (ii) the average of net income over the preceding four quarters), with progressively more stringent constraints as the Company approaches the minimum ratios.",
        "The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1 that were phased-in. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”), certain deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. In November 2017, the federal bank regulators revised the Capital Rules to extend the transitional treatment of MSRs, certain DTAs, investments in non-consolidated financial entities and minority interests for non-advanced approaches banking organizations (the “Transition Rules”), including the Company and FHB.",

The Capital Simplifications Rules and the rescission of the Transition Rule became effective for the Company as of April 1, 2020.

Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for credit risk (including recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as unused credit card and home equity lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2023, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2028. Under the current U.S. Capital Rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Company or the Bank.

Under the rule, during 2020 and 2021, the adjustment to CET1 capital reflects the change in retained earnings upon adoption of CECL at January 1, 2020, plus 25% of the increase in the allowance for credit losses since January 1, 2020.  See “Note 1.

Under the FDIA, in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency, a bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan, subject to certain limitations. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The obligation of a controlling bank holding company under the FDIA to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the FDIC. Institutions are also generally prohibited from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the institution is or would thereafter become undercapitalized. Institutions that are undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized and either fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, orders to elect new boards of directors, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.

A depository institution that is adequately capitalized and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates.

Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. These guidelines also prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the bank regulator must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution may be subject under the FDIA.

        "A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Anti-money laundering laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act,  impose compliance and due diligence obligations, and financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high-risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these requirements, and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including the imposition of civil money penalties or causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these requirements.",

Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act also revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the FDIC’s DIF are calculated. Under the amendments, the FDIC assessment base is no longer the institution’s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. The Dodd-Frank Act requires a phase-in of the minimum designated reserve ratio for the DIF, increasing it from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits which was achieved as of the third quarter of 2018.  FDIC regulations provide that, among other things, upon reaching the minimum, surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more will cease. The last quarterly surcharge was reflected in FNBPA’s December 2018 assessment invoice, which covered the assessment period from July 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018. FNBPA’s assessment invoices have not included a quarterly surcharge since that time. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the requirement of the FDIC to pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.  The FDIC has set the target designated reserve ratio at 2%. Assessment rates, which declined for all banks when the reserve ratio first surpassed 1.15% in the third quarter of 2016, are expected to remain unchanged. Assessment rates are scheduled to decrease when the reserve ratio exceeds 2%. The DIF and the DIF ratio were $117.9 billion and 1.29%, respectively, at December 31, 2020.",
        "In addition, TCJA, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, disallows the deduction of FDIC deposit insurance premium payments for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more.  For banks with less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, such as FNBPA, the premium deduction is phased-out based on the proportion of the bank’s assets exceeding $10 billion.",
        "In December 2019, the FDIC issued a proposed rule to modernize its brokered deposit regulations. The proposal would, among other things, establish a new framework for analyzing whether deposits placed through deposit placement arrangements qualify as brokered deposits. Notable aspects of the proposed rule include language: (i) defining the operative prongs of the definition of a “deposit broker;” (ii) creating three general tests to determine the applicability of the “primary purpose” exception; (iii) establishing an application process for entities that wish to make use of the primary purpose exception; and (iv) allowing wholly owned subsidiaries of insured depository institutions to make use of the “insured depository institution” (the “own bank”) exception.

In December 2013, the federal banking agencies adopted the Volcker Implementing Rules. The Volcker Implementing Rules prohibit banking entities from (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (2) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds, which are referred to as “covered funds.” The Volcker Implementing Rules are intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and of the related exemptions and exclusions. The Volcker Rule also requires each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include (for the largest entities) making regular reports about those activities to the entity’s regulators. Historically, this meant that reporting requirements were tied to a bank’s total assets, where banks with assets at or below $10 billion had less stringent reporting requirements and banks with more than $10 billion had increasingly more stringent requirements, as the size of the bank increased.",

The risk-based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit and market risk profiles among banks and financial holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. At December 31, 2020, our CET1, tier 1 and total capital ratios under these guidelines were 9.8%, 10.2% and 12.3%, respectively.

The rules implement the Basel Committee’s December 2010 framework for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including FNB and FNBPA, compared to the then-existing U.S. risk-based capital rules. Basel III defines the components of capital and addresses other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. Basel III also addresses risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in a banking institution’s regulatory capital ratios.",
        "Basel III, among other things, (i) introduces the concept of CET1, (ii) specifies that tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1” capital instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expands the scope of the deductions/adjustments as compared to existing regulations.",
        "Basel III requires FNB and FNBPA to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital (that is, tier 1 plus tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets (as compared to a prior minimum leverage ratio of 3% for banking organizations that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk).",
        "Under Basel III, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, banking organizations which do not use the advanced approach, such as FNB and FNBPA, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. FNB and FNBPA made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of FNB’s AFS securities portfolio. Basel III also precludes certain hybrid securities, such as TPS, as tier 1 capital of bank holding companies, subject to phase-out. TPS no longer included in FNB’s tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a component of tier 2 capital on a permanent basis without phase-out.",

",
        "In addition, Basel III provides more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increases the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation. In November 2017, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to extend the regulatory capital treatment applicable during 2017 under Basel III for certain items, including regulatory capital deductions, risk weights, and certain minority interest limitations. The relief provided under the final rule applies to banking organizations that are not subject to the capital rules’ advanced approaches, such as FNB.  Specifically, the final rule extends the current regulatory capital treatment of MSAs, DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock, non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that are not in the form of common stock, and CET1 minority interest, tier 1 minority interest, and total capital minority interest exceeding applicable minority interest limitations. Management believes that, as of December 31, 2020, FNB and FNBPA meet all capital adequacy requirements under Basel III on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements had been in effect.",
        "In July 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule simplifying certain aspects of Basel III, the key elements of which apply solely to banking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rules.  Under the final rule, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, such as FNB and FNBPA, apply a more simple regulatory capital treatment for MSAs; certain DTAs; investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions than those currently applied; and capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties (sometimes referred to as a minority interest) that is includable in regulatory capital. Specifically, the final rule eliminates: (i) the 10 percent CET1 capital deduction threshold that applies individually to MSAs, temporary difference DTAs, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock; (ii) the aggregate 15 percent CET1 capital deduction threshold that subsequently applies on a collective basis across such items; (iii) the 10 percent CET1 capital deduction threshold for non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions; and (iv) the deduction treatment for significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not in the form of common stock.  Basel III no longer has distinct treatments for significant and non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, but instead now requires that non-advanced approaches banking organizations deduct from CET1 capital any amount of MSAs, temporary difference DTAs, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that individually exceeds 25 percent of CET1 capital.

The Economic Growth Act also provided that bank holding companies under $100 billion in assets were no longer subject to stress testing requirements and provided the FRB with discretion to subject bank holding companies with more than $100 billion in total assets to enhanced supervision.  Notwithstanding these amendments, the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency bank regulatory guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than $100 billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process.

FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital-raising requirements, restrictions on its business and a variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and in certain circumstances the appointment of a conservator or receiver. An “undercapitalized” bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that bank’s compliance with the plan. The liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the bank’s assets at the time it became ”undercapitalized” or the amount needed to comply with the plan. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company, the obligation under such guarantee would take priority over the parent’s general unsecured creditors. In addition, FDICIA requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-capital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards.",

Such regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an institution is considered undercapitalized. Under the regulations, a “well-capitalized” institution must have a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0% and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0% and not be subject to a capital directive order. Under these guidelines, FNBPA was considered well-capitalized as of December 31, 2020.",

The QM Rule also adds an explicit maximum 43% debt-to-income ratio for borrowers if the loan is to meet the QM definition, though some mortgages that meet underwriting guidelines of U.S. GSEs, the Federal Housing Administration and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs may, for a period not to exceed seven years, meet the QM definition without being subject to the 43% debt-to-income limits. Additionally, regulations governing the servicing of residential mortgages have placed additional requirements on mortgage servicers that often lengthen the process for foreclosing on residential mortgages. The CFPB also adopted integrated disclosure requirements related to mortgage originations under RESPA and TILA and each statute’s implementing regulations.  These disclosure requirements became effective in October 2015. The CFPB issued proposed amendments to the requirements in July 2016, which were finalized in July 2017.  The CFPB also issued interpretive guidance and updated model disclosure forms in 2017.",
        "As discussed, the CFPB has the authority to take supervisory and enforcement action against banks and other financial services companies under the agency’s jurisdiction that fail to comply with federal consumer financial laws. As an insured depository institution with total assets of more than $10 billion, FNBPA is subject to the CFPB’s supervisory and enforcement authorities. The Dodd-Frank Act also permits states to adopt more strict consumer protection laws and state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the CFPB. We continuously evaluate the impact of the consumer rules issued by the CFPB to determine if they will have any long-term impact on our mortgage loan origination and servicing activities. Compliance with these rules will likely increase our overall regulatory compliance costs.  The CFPB has historically been active in bringing enforcement actions against banks and other financial institutions to enforce consumer financial laws.  The federal financial regulatory agencies, including the OCC and state attorneys general, have also become increasingly active in this area with respect to institutions over which they have jurisdiction.  We have incurred and may in the future incur additional costs in complying with these requirements.",
        "Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has backup enforcement authority over a depository institution holding company, such as FNB, if the conduct or threatened conduct (including any acts or omissions) of such holding company poses a risk to the DIF, although such authority may not be used if the holding company is in generally sound condition and does not pose a foreseeable and material risk to the DIF.  The Dodd-Frank Act may have a material impact on FNB and FNBPA's operations, particularly through increased compliance costs resulting from possible future consumer and fair lending regulations.",
        "Dividend Restrictions",
        "Our primary source of funds for cash distributions to our stockholders, and funds used to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, is dividends received from FNBPA. FNBPA is subject to federal laws and regulations governing its ability to pay dividends to FNB, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums. Under federal law, the amount of dividends that a national bank, such as FNBPA, may pay in a calendar year is dependent on the amount of its net income for the current year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years. The OCC has the authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a national bank on the bases that paying dividends that deplete a bank's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.  In addition to dividends from FNBPA, other sources of parent company liquidity for FNB include cash, short-term investments and issuance of debt instruments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries.",
        "In addition, the ability of FNB and FNBPA to pay dividends may be affected by the various minimum capital requirements previously described in the ",
        "“Capital and Operational Requirements,” “Basel III Capital Rules” and “Stress Testing”",

        "According to the Dodd-Frank Act and FRB policy, a financial or bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary. Consistent with the “source of strength” policy, the FRB has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank or financial holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and ",

        "In addition, if FNBPA was no longer “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” within the meaning of the BHC Act and FRB rules (which take into consideration capital ratios, examination ratings and other factors), the expedited processing of certain types of FRB applications would not be available to us. Moreover, examination ratings of “3” or lower, “unsatisfactory” ratings, capital ratios below well-capitalized levels, regulatory concerns regarding management, controls, assets, operations or other factors can all potentially result in the loss of financial holding company status, practical limitations on the ability of a bank or bank (or financial) holding company to engage in new activities, grow, acquire new businesses, repurchase its stock or pay dividends or continue to conduct existing activities.",
        "Financial Holding Company Status and Activities",
        "Under the BHC Act, an eligible bank holding company may elect to be a “financial holding company” and thereafter may engage in a range of activities that are financial in nature and that were not previously permissible for banks and bank holding companies. FNB is a financial holding company under the BHC Act. The financial holding company may engage directly or through a subsidiary in certain statutorily authorized activities (subject to certain restrictions and limitations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act). A financial holding company may also engage in any activity that has been determined by rule or order to be financial in nature, incidental to such financial activity, or (with prior FRB approval) complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose substantial risk to the safety and soundness of an institution or to the financial system generally. In addition to these activities, a financial holding company may engage in those activities permissible for a bank holding company that has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company.",
        "For a bank holding company to be eligible for financial holding company status, all of its subsidiary U.S. depository institutions must be “well-capitalized” and “well-managed.” The FRB generally must deny expanded authority to any bank holding company with a subsidiary insured depository institution that received less than a satisfactory rating on its most recent CRA review as of the time it submits its request for financial holding company status. If, after becoming a financial holding company and undertaking activities not permissible for a bank holding company under the BHC Act, the company fails to continue to meet any of the requirements for financial holding company status, the company must enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the FRB may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company.",

        "Effective April 1, 2020, the FRB implemented a rule to codify and simplify its interpretations and opinions regarding regulatory presumptions of control. The rule will likely have a meaningful impact on control determinations related to investments in banks and bank holding companies and investments by bank holding companies in non-bank companies.",
        "Incentive Compensation",
        "Guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice. The federal banking agencies jointly adopted the Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies intended to ensure that banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. This guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to expose the organization to material amounts of risk, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide employee incentives that appropriately balance risk in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk, (ii) be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.  Monitoring methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and its use of incentive compensation.  Any deficiencies in the compensation practices of FNB or its subsidiaries and affiliates could lead to supervisory or enforcement action.",
        "Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, such as FNB, having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risk-taking by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators were required to establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The federal banking agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011 and issued a second proposed rule in June 2016. The second proposed rule would apply to all banks, among other institutions, with at least $1 billion in average total consolidated assets, for which it would go beyond the Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies discussed above to prohibit certain types and features of incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive officers, require incentive-based compensation arrangements to adhere to certain basic principles to avoid a presumption of encouraging inappropriate risk, require appropriate board or committee oversight, establish minimum recordkeeping and mandate disclosures to the appropriate agency. In addition, institutions with at least $50 billion in average total consolidated assets would be subject to additional compensation-related requirements and prohibitions.  The prospects for continued consideration of these proposed rules by the SEC and federal banking agencies are uncertain, but implementation of any final rules is not expected in the near term. Nevertheless, incentive compensation and sales practices, particularly in connection with certain products and services that are viewed as high-risk from a supervisory perspective - such as cross-selling and overdraft services - continue to be priority issues on the examination and supervision agendas of the CFPB and the federal banking agencies.",

Significantly, in June 2018, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a mandate vacating the DOL's \"fiduciary rule\" and related prohibited transaction exemptions.

Rather than providing specific rules, the Guidelines set forth basic compliance considerations and guidance with respect to a depository institution.  Failure to meet the standards in the Guidelines, however, could result in a request by the OCC to one of the nationally chartered banks to provide a written compliance plan to demonstrate its efforts to come into compliance with such Guidelines.

We expect ADAS volume to recover from the effects of COVID-19 faster than overall global vehicle production, and we expect long-term growth of ADAS to remain unaffected as consumers increasingly consider ADAS a differentiating factor in their automotive purchasing decisions. ",
        "The continued growth of ADAS is dependent on various factors, including regulation, market demand, and consumers' recognition of its value. Mobileye's ADAS solutions also serve as a qualification space for our autonomous technology, using vast experience and proliferation to validate and constantly improve AV technology. This year, we introduced Mobileye Supervision, the EyeQ5-based solution that incorporates an end-to-end engine control unit, surround-view camera array, processors, driving policy, and high-definition maps—all derived directly from our ongoing autonomous vehicle program.

        "Despite the COVID-19-related impact on vehicle production, OEMs are still looking to enhance current L2+ solutions by improving system fidelity, availability, and performance. High-definition maps with constant updates, global coverage, and various semantic features are prerequisites for L2+ applications and the future deployment of robotaxi and passenger car autonomy (Consumer AV). Canonical mapping methods rely on extensive manual labor and dedicated mapping vehicles. Mobileye's disruptive REM crowdsource mapping technology provides automatic map creation and updates. REM mapping capabilities are also being leveraged to extend the value of static and dynamic data to businesses in new market segments such as smart cities and infrastructure surveys.",
        "We believe the future of autonomous driving will unfold in two phases: commercial robotaxi and series-production passenger car consumer AVs. We expect consumer AVs to materialize only after the robotaxi industry deploys and matures. The main inhibitors of a mass market product offering of consumer AV are the cost of AV technology, ability to scale at a low cost, regulatory framework, and public acceptance. Thus, we see the robotaxi phase as a necessary corridor to consumer AV. Mobileye is well-positioned to play a significant role in the broader MaaS market with the commercialization of robotaxi and the future consumer AV market. Our full-stack self-driving system—geared with our camera-centric backbone and vast experience in productizing cutting-edge technology in the automotive industry—is the foundation for developing an economically competitive AV solution. Proliferation of data-collection vehicles alongside REM technology will allow for low-cost geographic expansion and coverage. Together with Moovit's complementary assets in the service layers, Mobileye is building itself as an end-to-end service provider at scale.",

Our 5th Gen EyeQ5 SoC is designed to act as the central computer for fully autonomous driving vehicles. We have been able to achieve power, performance, and cost targets by employing proprietary computational cores that are optimized for a wide variety of computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning tasks, including deep neural networks. Starting with EyeQ5, we are supporting an automotive-grade standard operating system and providing a complete software development kit to allow customers to differentiate their solutions by deploying their algorithms on EyeQ5. The EyeQ5 SoC is expected to be in commercial vehicles starting in 2021 and is already operational in our autonomous test vehicles.",

Using vehicles equipped with Mobileye's road mapping technology, we provide highly refreshed geographic information systems data about the road network, infrastructure assets, pavement condition, mobility, and traffic. This information allows our customers to monitor and preserve their infrastructure more efficiently, making roadways and streets safer for all.",
        "The third building block in our full stack offering is our unique formal model for AV safety (RSS). At its core, RSS is a pragmatic method to design and then efficiently validate the safety of an AV, serving as the governing safety layer for the decision-making system. RSS formalizes human decision making for safe driving under two main principles: first, it acknowledges the need to balance safety with useful driving by making plausible worst-case scenario assumptions for other road users; and second, it provides a technology-neutral model and a transparent framework for the regulatory endeavor of building an industry standard for safety. In late 2019, Intel was named to lead the IEEE working group to develop AV decision making standards.",

Gains or losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. We are exposed to currency exchange risks from our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt indebtedness and may use foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage this risk.",
        "Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, the Israeli shekel, and the Chinese yuan. We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-U.S. dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards or option contracts in these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 10% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions outstanding as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, would result in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $61 million and less than $38 million, respectively.",
        "Interest Rates",

The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and the financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns. We also enter into swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into floating-rate coupon payments for our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.",
        "A hypothetical increase in benchmark interest rates of up to 1%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $75 million as of December 26, 2020 (a hypothetical decrease of 1% would have resulted in an increase of approximately $88 million as of December 28, 2019).",

To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio. Assuming a decline of 60% in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by approximately $1.1 billion, based on the value as of December 26, 2020 (a decrease in value of approximately $180 million, based on the value as of December 28, 2019 using an assumed decline of 40%).

From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and conditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.",
        "In accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date, 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits, and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance. Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay. ",

Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor.

To the extent product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. Conversely, at times product demand increases or we fail to forecast accurately or produce the mix of products demanded, and we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough, or otherwise fail to meet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships.

The importance of these factors varies by product and market segment. For example, our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment. In our IOTG business, for example, interoperability, connectivity, safety, security, industrial use conditions, and long-life support are among the key competitive factors.

Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms, such as the ARM architecture, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products are being used in PCs and servers, which could lead to further development and growth of the ARM ecosystem. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers. Some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads. For example, in 2020, Apple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our client CPUs.",

Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. For example, in 2020, NVIDIA announced an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings plc, and AMD announced an agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.",

We are focusing our R&D efforts across several key areas: process and packaging technology, architecture, memory, interconnect, security, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. We cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our 7nm process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectations, as discussed in the risk factor “We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology.” To the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages. In addition, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new product designs. To the extent our R&D efforts do not timely produce semiconductor designs for our platform products with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product.",

Some of our efforts to develop and market new products fail, and the products and technologies we invest in and develop are not always well received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies.

        "These new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our expanded TAM, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some of these market segments, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes utilize technologies that are different from the ones that we develop and manufacture, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments. In addition, we must continually improve the cost, performance, integration, time-to-market, and energy efficiency of our products, as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions. Some of these new businesses face challenging market conditions. For example, market pricing for NAND memory products has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.

Our adjacent products also typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced platform products, and at times are not profitable. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platform products in any of our market segments, or our adjacent products represent an increasingly greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage may decrease.",

Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes. ",
        "We are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We  experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology. Although we began shipping products based on our 10nm process technology in volume in 2019, our delays in transitioning to this node occurred while third-party foundries such as TSMC developed new, competitive process technologies. Competitors using third-party foundries are able to benefit from the improvements such process technologies have made in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which has helped increase the competitiveness of their products. In 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our 7nm process technology that resulted in yield degradation, which was the primary driver for a delay in our expectations for our 7nm-based CPU product timing. These delays can allow competitors to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us by third-party foundries and could adversely affect the competitiveness of our products. Because of the delays in our 10nm and 7nm process technologies, we may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products. To increase our manufacturing and design flexibility, we have developed a disaggregated design approach for certain products, which enables us to manufacture processors and components on different process technologies, including third-party foundry processes, and connect them in a single package with advanced packaging technologies. This approach introduces additional risks as described in the risk factor “We face supply chain risks.” ",
        "Our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance of the process node introduction. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&D investments, particularly as development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses.",

        "Risks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, and product defects and errata. Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, including additional cores or other competitive features in our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs and adversely affect our gross margins, and can contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. When we introduce a new process node, it typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields. For example, our increased 10nm product mix in 2020 had a negative impact on our overall unit cost and gross margins, and yields on our 10nm manufacturing process remain below our mature 14nm process. In addition, the improvements we expect to make in 10nm costs and yields may not proceed at the same rate as the improvements we made on 14nm. As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields.",
        "From time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, interruptions in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. ",
        "Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations. In addition, delays in our product introductions can cause us to become less competitive and lose revenue opportunities, and our gross margin could be adversely affected because we incur significant costs up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to offset these costs over time.",
        "We face supply chain risks.",
        " Thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our business. Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain materials and equipment, including certain photolithography tools, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. In addition, supplier consolidation or business failures can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. Finding and qualifying alternate or additional suppliers is often a lengthy process and can lead to production delays or additional costs, and such alternatives are sometimes not available at all. The inability of suppliers to deliver necessary production materials or equipment can disrupt our production processes and make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Suppliers periodically extend lead times, face capacity constraints, limit supplies, increase prices, experience quality issues, or encounter cybersecurity or other issues that can interrupt or increase the cost of our supply. Our production can be disrupted by the unavailability of resources, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources at times requires us to reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our manufacturing operations and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, where an injunction against Intel or a supplier could interrupt the availability of goods or services supplied to Intel by others.",
        "We also rely on third-party providers to manufacture, assemble and test, and supply certain components and products, including for areas such as networking, communications, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory. We may utilize third-party providers for these and other components and products in the future. From time to time, these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely or cost-effective basis, in sufficient volumes, or at all. In some cases there are limited or no readily available satisfactory alternate providers. In any of these circumstances, we can encounter supply delays or disruptions or incur additional costs that could prevent us from meeting customer demand and/or adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, while we have a supply agreement with Micron providing for the supply of Intel 3D XPoint memory, we may need to fund and develop internal manufacturing options to continue 3D XPoint memory supply in the longer term. We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, manufacturing yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured or supplied by third parties.",
        "Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed, our costs could increase, and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected.",

        "We must attract, retain, and motivate key employees. ",
        "Hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business. The competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is increasingly intense. Competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees. In addition, changes in immigration policies may further limit the pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. Changes in the interpretation and application of employment-related laws to our workforce practices may also result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. If our share-based or other compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees would be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Moreover, sustained declines in our stock price can reduce the retention value of our share-based awards. Changes in our management team can also disrupt our business. For example, we underwent several significant changes to our technical leadership during 2020 and announced the appointment of a new CEO in January 2021. The failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees, including in connection with these changes, could adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent we do not effectively hire, onboard, retain, and motivate key employees, our business can be harmed.",

Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return in a timely fashion, if at all. Our ability to realize a return on our investment in a private company, if any, is typically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition.

At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties sell products that compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. From time to time, they face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.",

The cloud and cloud applications represent a new and increasingly demanding computing environment. The further consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and applications; product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product security and security features. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, and to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors, our competitive position and market segment share may be adversely affected. ",
        "Some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including designs customized for their specific computing workloads. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise and government market segment customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads. During the second half of 2020, the mix shift in sales from enterprise and government market segment customers to cloud service providers contributed to lower ASPs in DCG.

In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. ",

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

        "Description of the Matter",
        "The Company's net inventory totaled $8.4 billion as of December 26, 2020, representing 5.5% of total assets. As explained in \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and applies judgment in determining saleability of products and the valuation of inventories. The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order to assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the products have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the determination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of saleable quality. ",
        "Auditing management’s assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the determination of lower of cost or net realizable value and excess and obsolete inventory reserves is judgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as customer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand. Additionally, for certain new product launches there is limited historical data with which to evaluate forecasts.",
        "How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit",
        "We evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over the costing of inventory, the determination of whether inventory is of saleable quality, the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value reserves including related estimated costs and selling prices, and the determination of demand forecasts and related application against on hand inventory.",
        "Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions (e.g., estimated product costs and selling prices, and product demand forecasts) and the underlying data used in management’s inventory valuation assessment. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends. We assessed whether there were any potential sources of contrary information, including historical forecast accuracy or history of significant revisions to previously recorded inventory valuation adjustments, and performed sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in inventory valuation that would result from changes in the assumptions.",

        "Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting",
        "A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ",
        "Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Intel and our subsidiaries. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.",
        "Use of Estimates",
        "The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19 on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.",

        "Revenue Recognition",
        "We recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or services to customers. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sales. In accordance with contract terms, revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed upon shipping terms. ",
        "We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Variable consideration is estimated and reflected as an adjustment to the transaction price. We determine variable consideration, which consists primarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. Sales rebates earned by customers are offset against their receivable balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do not have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within other accrued liabilities.",
        "We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs for marketing activities for some of our products. We generally record the payment as a reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct service, which we record as expense when the marketing activities occur.",
        "Inventories",
        "We compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales, and when cost of sales can be capitalized as inventory. ",
        "For a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as PRQ. We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. A single PRQ has previously valued inventory up to $870 million in the quarter the PRQ milestone was achieved. Prior to PRQ, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost of sales in the period incurred.",
        "The valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities. We apply our historical loadings compared to our total available capacity in a statistical model to determine our normal capacity level. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges are insignificant in the years presented. Charges in years prior to those presented have ranged up to $1.1 billion taken in connection with the 2009 economic recession.",
        "Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle, variations in market pricing, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. Lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserves fluctuate as we ramp new process technologies with costs improving over time due to scale and improved yields. Additionally, inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical changes in market conditions and the associated pricing environment.",

        "The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of salable quality. We use the demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off amounts considered to be excess inventory. ",
        "Property, Plant and Equipment",
        "We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment.",
        "We evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives.",
        "Assets are \"grouped\" and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. ",
        "Fair Value",
        "When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, grants receivable, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.",

        "Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.",
        "▪",
        "Level 2.",
        "Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use LIBOR-based yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.",
        "▪",
        "Level 3.",
        "Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.",
        "Debt Investments",
        "We consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements.",
        "Marketable debt investments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net.

Available-for-sale debt investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalents. Available-for-sale debt investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Available-for-sale debt investments with remaining maturities beyond one year are classified as other long-term investments. Available-for-sale debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level, and record the interest income and realized gains or losses on the sale of these investments in interest and other, net.",
        "Our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews. For investments in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists by considering information about the collectability of the instrument, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We recognize an allowance for credit losses, up to the amount of the unrealized loss when appropriate, and write down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in interest and other, net, and unrealized losses not related to credit losses are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).",
        "Equity Investments",
        "We regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows: ",
        "▪",
        "Marketable equity securities",

        "Non-marketable equity securities",

        "▪",
        "Equity method investments",
        "are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss. Our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investments is recognized on a one-quarter lag.",
        "Realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates. ",
        "Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investee's fair value. Qualitative factors considered include the investee's financial condition and business outlook, industry and sector performance, market for technology, operational and financing cash flow activities, and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches, which require judgment and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee revenue and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. ",
        "▪",
        "Non-marketable equity securities",
        " are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and long-lived assets.

We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. For presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments, including related collateral amounts, are presented at fair value on a gross basis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities.",

For foreign currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, and are recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the cash flow hedge transactions become improbable, the corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be immediately reclassified to interest and other, net. These derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item.",

        " use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the offsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other, net.

We also use interest rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our U.S.-dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt instruments classified as trading assets. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded through earnings in the line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income to which the derivatives most closely relate, primarily in interest and other, net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives. ",
        "Loans Receivable",
        "We elect the fair value option when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at the inception of the loan with a related derivative instrument. When the fair value option is not elected, the loans are carried at amortized cost. We measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method, which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate. We classify our loans within other current and long-term assets. ",
        "Credit Risk",
        "Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, loans receivable, reverse repurchase agreements, and trade receivables. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty's relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy, substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. ",
        "We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 26, 2020, our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding money market funds invested in U.S. treasury and U.S. agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $2.0 billion. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our derivative counterparties and obtain and secure collateral from counterparties against obligations, including securities lending transactions when we deem it appropriate. Cash collateral exchanged under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. For reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledged.",

Additionally, as part of this assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.",
        "Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. Significant estimates include market segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share, estimated costs, and discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital.",

The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. Operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating income to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments.

In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged \"conditional rebates and payments\" that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged \"payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.\" The EC imposed a fine in the amount of €1.1 billion ($1.4 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to \"immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in\" the EC decision.",
        "The EC decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision stated that we should \"cease and desist\" from further conduct that, in the EC's opinion, would violate applicable law. We took steps, which are subject to the EC's ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We had discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices.",
        "We appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our appeal took place in July 2012. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In November 2014, Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed comments in support of Intel's grounds of appeal. The EC and interveners filed briefs in November 2014, we filed a reply in February 2015, and the EC filed a rejoinder in April 2015. The Court of Justice held oral argument in June 2016. In October 2016, Advocate General Wahl, an advisor to the Court of Justice, issued a non-binding advisory opinion that favored Intel on a number of grounds. The Court of Justice issued its decision in September 2017, setting aside the judgment of the General Court and sending the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. The General Court has appointed a panel of five judges to consider our ",

        "In June 2017, a Google research team notified us and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities (now commonly referred to as \"Spectre\" and \"Meltdown\") that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. On January 3, 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available. ",
        "Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel and, in certain cases, our current and former executives and directors, in U.S. federal and state courts and in certain courts in other countries relating to the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities, as well as other variants of these vulnerabilities that have since been identified.",
        "As of January 20, 2021, consumer class action lawsuits relating to the above class of security vulnerabilities publicly disclosed since 2018 were pending in the U.S., Canada, and Israel. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the U.S., numerous individual class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated in April 2018 for all pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. In March 2020, the court granted Intel's motion to dismiss the complaint in that consolidated action but granted plaintiffs leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in May 2020, which Intel moved to dismiss in July 2020; argument on the motion was heard in December 2020. In Canada, in one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled. In a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec, the court has stayed the case until January 2021. In Israel, two consumer class action lawsuits were filed in the District Court of Haifa. In the first case, the District Court denied the parties' joint motion to stay filed in January 2019, but to date has deferred Intel's deadline to respond to the complaint. Intel filed a motion to stay the second case pending resolution of the consolidated proceeding in the U.S., and a hearing on that motion has been scheduled for November 2020. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters.",
        "In addition to these lawsuits, Intel stockholders filed multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits since January 2018 against certain current and former members of our Board of Directors and certain current and former officers, alleging that the defendants breached their duties to Intel in connection with the disclosure of the security vulnerabilities and the failure to take action in relation to alleged insider trading. The complaints sought to recover damages from the defendants on behalf of Intel. Some of the derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and were consolidated, and the others were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California in San Mateo County and were consolidated. The federal court granted defendants' motion to dismiss in August 2018 on the ground that plaintiffs failed to plead facts sufficient to show they were excused from making a pre-lawsuit demand on the Board. The federal court granted plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, but subsequently dismissed the cases in January 2019 at plaintiffs' request. The California Superior Court entered judgment in defendants' favor in August 2020 after granting defendants' motions to dismiss plaintiffs' consolidated complaint and three successive amended complaints, all for failure to plead facts sufficient to show plaintiffs were excused from making pre-lawsuit demand on the Board. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the California court's judgment in October 2020. In January 2021, another Intel stockholder filed a derivative lawsuit in the Superior Court in San Mateo County against certain current and former officers and members of our Board of Directors. The lawsuit asserts claims similar to those dismissed in August 2020, except that it alleges that the stockholder made a pre-lawsuit demand on our Board of Directors and that the demand was wrongfully refused.

        "VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel",
        "In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against Intel in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging infringement of eight patents acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). The patents, which originated at Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. and NXP B.V., are U.S. Patent Nos. 7,268,588; 7,675,806; 7,706,207; 7,709,303; 8,004,922; 8,020,014; 8,268,672; and 8,566,836. VLSI accuses various FPGA and processor products of infringement. VLSI estimated its damages to be as high as $7.1 billion, and its complaint further sought enhanced damages, future royalties, attorneys' fees, costs, and interest. In May, June, September, and October 2018, Intel filed IPR petitions challenging the patentability of claims in all eight of the patents in-suit. The PTAB instituted review of six patents and denied institution on two patents. As a result of the institution decisions, the parties stipulated to stay the District Court action in March 2019. In December 2019 and February 2020, the PTAB found all claims of the '588 and '303 patents, and some claims of the '922 patent, to be unpatentable. The PTAB found the challenged claims of the '014, '672 and '207 patents to be patentable. Intel moved for a continuation of the stay in March 2020 as it appealed certain rulings by the PTAB. In June 2020, the District Court issued an order continuing the stay through August 2021 and setting trial for December 2022.",
        "In June 2018, VLSI filed a second suit against Intel, in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement by various Intel processors of five additional patents acquired from NXP: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,212,663; 7,246,027; 7,247,552; 7,523,331; and 8,081,026. VLSI accused Intel of willful infringement and seeks an injunction or, in the alternative, ongoing royalties, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and interest. In March 2019, the District Court dismissed VLSI's claims for willful infringement as to all the patents-in-suit except the '027 patent, and also dismissed VLSI's allegations of indirect infringement as to the '633, '331, and '026 patents. In June 2019, Intel filed IPR petitions challenging the patentability of claims in all five patents-in-suit. In January 2020, the District Court vacated the November 2020 trial date based on agreement of the parties; no trial date is currently set. In January and February 2020, the PTAB instituted review of the '552, '633, '331 and '026 patents and as a result, Intel moved for stay of the District Court proceedings. In May 2020, the District Court stayed the case as to the '026 and '552 patents but allowed the case to proceed on the '027 and '331 patents. For these two patents, VLSI is seeking damages of approximately $4.13 billion plus enhanced damages for the '027 patent. VLSI is no longer asserting claims from the '633 patent. ",
        "In March 2019, VLSI filed a third suit against Intel, also in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of six more patents acquired from NXP: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,366,522; 6,663,187; 7,292,485; 7,606,983; 7,725,759; and 7,793,025. In April 2019, VLSI voluntarily dismissed this Delaware case without prejudice. In April 2019, VLSI filed three new infringement suits against Intel in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas (WDTX) accusing various Intel processors of infringement. The three suits collectively assert the same six patents from the voluntarily dismissed Delaware case plus two additional patents acquired from NXP, U.S. Patent Nos. 7,523,373 and 8,156,357. VLSI accuses Intel of willful infringement and seeks an injunction or, in the alternative, ongoing royalties, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and interest. Specifically, VLSI is seeking damages of approximately $11 billion collectively in the Texas cases, plus enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement. In the first Texas case, VLSI is asserting the '373 and '759 patents. (In December 2020, the court granted Intel summary judgment of non-infringement on the '357 patent.)",

That case was originally scheduled for trial in November 2020, but the court has now moved trial to February 2021. In October and November 2019 and in February 2020, Intel filed IPR petitions on certain asserted claims across six of the patents-in-suit in WDTX. Between May and October 2020, the PTAB denied all of these requests, and Intel has requested a rehearing, as well as a review from the Precedential Opinion Panel (POP), as to all petitions.

A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.",

        "As described in Notes A and G to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As disclosed by management, during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, management recognizes tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. As further described by management, these tax liabilities are recognized when, despite management’s belief that the tax return positions are supportable, management believes that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Management bases its assessment of the accruals for tax liabilities on many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. As of December 31, 2020, unrecognized tax benefits were $8.6 billion.",
        "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to uncertain tax positions is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when estimating the uncertain tax positions, including applying complex tax laws, and a high degree of estimation uncertainty based on potential for significant adjustments as a result of audits by tax authorities or other forms of tax settlement. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort, and subjectivity in performing procedures to evaluate management’s timely identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Also, the evaluation of audit evidence available to support the uncertain tax positions is complex and required significant auditor judgment as the nature of the evidence is often inherently subjective, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.",

Of our U.S. employees, approximately 23,100 are hourly, with unions representing approximately 14,300 employees. Approximately 10,800 of this number are represented by the United Steelworkers union (\"USW\").",

These master agreements cover several specific items, including wages, select benefit programs, successorship, employment security, and health and safety.  Individual facilities continue to have local agreements for other subjects not covered by the master agreements. If local facility agreements are not successfully negotiated at the time of expiration, under the terms of the master agreements the local contracts will automatically renew with the same terms in effect. The master agreements cover the majority of our union represented mills and converting facilities. In addition, International Paper is party to a master agreement with District Council 2, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, covering additional converting facilities. ",

Most of our manufacturing and converting facilities we deemed essential have remained open and operational during the pandemic.

We have implemented work-systems across the Company, including hygiene, social distancing, site cleaning, contract tracing and other measures, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. As a sign of our appreciation for our workers during the pandemic, the Company gave a one-time bonus to all employees in December 2020.  ",

We accomplish this, in part, by developing the capabilities of our team members through our continuous learning, development and performance management programs. One such program is our REACH (Recruit, Engage, Align College Hires) program through which the Company recruits and develops early-career engineers and safety professionals for our U.S. Mill system, preparing them to become future leaders. We invest in the growth and development of our employees by providing a multi-dimensional approach to learning that empowers, intellectually grows, and professionally develops our employees. We provide continuing education courses that are relevant to our industry and job function within the Company. In addition, we have created learning paths for specific positions that are designed to encourage an employee’s advancement and growth within our organization. We also offer a peer mentor program and leadership and customer service training to support and develop our employees. These resources provide employees with the skills they need to achieve their career goals, build management skills and become leaders within our Company.

To foster a more diverse and inclusive culture, the Company is focused on (1) promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion that leverages the talents of all employees, and (2) implementing practices that attract, recruit and retain diverse top talent. The Company supports employee-led networking groups that are open to all employees and provide a forum to communicate and exchange ideas, build a network of relationships across the Company, and pursue personal and professional development, such as the Women in International Paper Employee Networking Circle, African American Employee Networking Circle (\"IPmove\"), LGBTQ Employee Networking Circle (“IPride”) and a Veterans Employee Networking Circle.

Our safety management programs are designed to use a collaborative approach to focus on both employee and contractor safety. For our employees, driving is generally deemed to be the most hazardous activity associated with our business given the geographic dispersion of our assets. However, for our contracted workforce, activities associated with tree felling, extraction of logs and log transportation are the most critical risk areas. ",

Similar industry practices and regulations do not exist in the United States for contractors. Nonetheless, in addition to our employee safety programs in the U.S., we initiated programs with our U.S. contractors to better educate them on safe work practices.  In 2020, our contractors published 9 safety alerts and completed 1,398 training courses on safe trucking. ",

        "Marine Transportation Segment Risk Factors",
        "The Inland Waterway infrastructure is aging and may result in increased costs and disruptions to the Company’s marine transportation segment. Maintenance of the United States inland waterway system is vital to the Company’s operations. The system is composed of over 12,000 miles of commercially navigable waterway, supported by over 240 locks and dams designed to provide flood control, maintain pool levels of water in certain areas of the country and facilitate navigation on the inland river system. The United States inland waterway infrastructure is aging, with more than half of the locks over 50 years old. As a result, due to the age of the locks, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance outages may be more frequent in nature, resulting in delays and additional operating expenses. One-half of the cost of new construction and major rehabilitation of locks and dams is paid by marine transportation companies through a 29 cent per gallon diesel fuel tax and the remaining 50% of waterway infrastructure and improvement is paid from general federal tax revenues. Failure of the federal government to adequately fund infrastructure maintenance and improvements in the future would have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to deliver products for its customers on a timely basis. In addition, any additional user taxes that may be imposed in the future to fund infrastructure improvements would increase the Company’s operating expenses.",
        "The Company could be adversely impacted by a marine accident or spill event. A marine accident or spill event could close a portion of the inland waterway system or a coastal area of the United States for an extended period of time. Although statistically marine transportation is the safest means of surface transportation of bulk commodities, accidents do occur, both involving Company equipment and equipment owned by other marine operators.",
        "The Company transports a wide variety of petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals throughout the Mississippi River System, on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, coastwise along all three United States coasts and in Alaska and Hawaii. The Company manages its exposure to losses from potential unauthorized discharges of pollutants through the use of well-maintained and equipped tank barges and towing vessels, through safety, training and environmental programs, and through the Company’s insurance program, but a discharge of pollutants by the Company could have an adverse effect on the Company. Risks may arise for which the Company may not be insured. Claims covered by insurance are subject to deductibles, the aggregate amount of which could be material, and certain policies impose limitations on coverage. Existing insurance coverage may not be able to be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or coverage capacity for certain risks may not be available or adequate to cover future claims. If a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured, or the carrier is unable or unwilling to cover the claim, the Company could be exposed to liability.",
        "The Company’s marine transportation segment is dependent on its ability to adequately crew its towing vessels. The Company’s vessels are crewed with employees who are licensed or certified by the USCG, including its captains, pilots, engineers and tankermen. The success of the Company’s marine transportation segment is dependent on the Company’s ability to adequately crew its vessels. As a result, the Company invests significant resources in training its crews and providing crew members an opportunity to advance from a deckhand to the captain of a Company towboat or tugboat. Inland crew members generally work rotations such as 20 days on, 10 days off rotation, or a 30 days on, 15 days off rotation. For the coastal fleet, crew members are generally required to work rotations such as 14 days on, 14 days off rotation, a 21 days on, 21 days off rotation or a 30 days on, 30 days off rotation, dependent upon the location. The nature of crewmember work schedules and assignments away from home for extended periods require special recruiting and at times it can be difficult to find candidates. With ongoing retirements and competitive labor pressure in the marine transportation segment, the Company continues to monitor and implement market competitive pay practices. The Company also utilizes an internal development program to train Maritime Academy graduates for vessel leadership positions.",

None of the segment’s inland operations are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The segment’s coastal operations include approximately 600 vessel employees, of whom approximately 375 are subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain geographic areas. Any work stoppages or labor disputes could adversely affect coastal operations in those areas. To date, the Company has been able to manage crewing of its vessels despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with only minimal vessel delays and disruption of services, but with some loss of revenue which have primarily impacted our offshore vessels.  The Company continues to update its processes relating to management of COVID-19 and provide related employee education as new information and guidance becomes available.",
        "The Company’s marine transportation segment is subject to the Jones Act. The Company’s marine transportation segment competes principally in markets subject to the Jones Act, a federal cabotage law that restricts domestic marine transportation in the United States to vessels built and registered in the United States, and manned, owned and operated by United States citizens. The Company presently meets all of the requirements of the Jones Act for its owned and operated vessels. The loss of Jones Act status could have a significant negative effect on the Company. The requirements that the Company’s vessels be United States built and manned by United States citizens, the crewing requirements and material requirements of the USCG, and the application of United States labor and tax laws increases the cost of United States flagged vessels compared to comparable foreign flagged vessels. The Company’s business could be adversely affected if the Jones Act or international trade agreements or laws were to be modified or waived as to permit foreign flagged vessels to operate in the United States as these vessels are not subject to the same United States government imposed regulations, laws, and restrictions. Since the events of September 11, 2001, the United States government has taken steps to increase security of United States ports, coastal waters and inland waterways. The Company believes that it is unlikely that the current cabotage provisions of the Jones Act would be eliminated or significantly modified in a way that has a material adverse impact on the Company in the foreseeable future.",
        "The Secretary of Homeland Security is vested with the authority and discretion to waive the Jones Act to such extent and upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe whenever the Secretary deems that such action is necessary in the interest of national defense. On September 8, 2017, following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the Department of Homeland Security issued a waiver of the Jones Act for a 7-day period for shipments from New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Louisiana to South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Puerto Rico. The waiver was specifically tailored to address the transportation of refined petroleum products due to disruptions in hurricane-affected areas. On September 11, 2017, the waiver was extended for 11 days and expanded to include additional states. Following Hurricane Maria, on September 28, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security issued a waiver of the Jones Act for movement of products shipped from United States coastwise points to Puerto Rico through October 18, 2017. Waivers of the Jones Act, whether in response to natural disasters or otherwise, could result in increased competition from foreign tank vessel operators, which could negatively impact the marine transportation segment.",
        "The Company’s marine transportation segment is subject to extensive regulation by the USCG, federal laws, other federal agencies, various state laws and certain international conventions, as well as numerous environmental regulations. The majority of the Company’s vessels are subject to inspection by the USCG and carry certificates of inspection. The crews employed by the Company aboard vessels are licensed or certified by the USCG. The Company is required by various governmental agencies to obtain licenses, certificates and permits for its owned and operated vessels. The Company’s operations are also affected by various United States and state regulations and legislation enacted for protection of the environment. The Company incurs significant expenses and capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations and any significant new regulation or legislation, including climate change laws or regulations, could have an adverse effect on the Company.",
        "The Company’s marine transportation segment is subject to natural gas and crude oil prices as well as the volatility of their prices as well as the volatility in production of refined products and petrochemicals in the United States. For 2020, 52% of the marine transportation segment’s revenues were from the movement of petrochemicals, including the movement of raw materials and feedstocks from one refinery or petrochemical plant to another, as well as the movement of more finished products to end users and terminals for export. During 2020, petrochemical and refined products volumes decreased relative to 2019 and 2018, as a result of reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic and petrochemical and refinery plant shutdowns. However, the United States petrochemical industry continues to benefit from a low-cost domestically produced natural gas feedstock advantage, producing strong volumes of raw materials and intermediate products for transportation between Gulf Coast petrochemical plants and the transportation of more finished products to terminals for both domestic consumers and for export destinations. In addition, approximately seven new United States petrochemical projects, including expansion of existing plants or new plants, are scheduled to be completed during 2021, which should provide additional movements for the marine transportation segment. Higher natural gas and crude oil prices are generally better for the Company’s businesses, however higher natural gas prices and other factors could negatively impact the United States petrochemical industry and its production volumes, which could negatively impact the Company.",

        "Demand for tank barge transportation services is driven by the production of volumes of the bulk liquid commodities such as petrochemicals, black oil and refined petroleum products that the Company transports by tank barge. This production can depend on the prevailing level of natural gas and crude oil prices, as well as the volatility of their prices.  In general, lower energy prices are good for the United States economy and typically translate into increased petrochemical and refined product demand and therefore increased demand for tank barge transportation services. However, during 2016 and 2017 lower crude oil prices resulted in a decline in domestic crude oil and natural gas condensate production and reduced volumes to be transported by tank barge. The Company estimates that at the beginning of 2015 there were approximately 550 inland tank barges and 35 coastal tank barges in the 195,000 barrels or less category transporting crude oil and natural gas condensate. At the end of 2016, the Company estimated that approximately 140 inland tank barges and approximately 10 coastal tank barges in the 195,000 barrels or less category were transporting such products, a reduction of approximately 410 inland tank barges and 25 coastal tank barges that moved into other markets. At the end of 2017, the Company estimated that approximately 250 inland tank barges and approximately three coastal tank barges were transporting crude and natural gas condensate. At the end of 2018, the Company estimates that approximately 375 inland tank barges and approximately three coastal tank barges were transporting crude and natural gas condensate. As of the end of 2019, the Company estimates that approximately 335 inland tank barges and approximately five coastal tank barges were transporting crude and natural gas condensate.  During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price volatility resulted in a sharp decrease in volumes of crude and natural gas condensate being transported.  As of the end of 2020, the Company estimates that approximately 100 to 150 inland tank barges and one coastal tank barge were transporting crude and natural gas condensate.  Volatility in the price of natural gas and crude oil can also result in heightened uncertainty which may lead to decreased production and delays in new petrochemical and refinery plant construction. Increased competition for available black oil and petrochemical barge moves caused by reduced crude oil and natural gas condensate production could have an adverse impact on the Company’s marine transportation segment including as a result of lower spot and term contract rates and/or reluctance to enter into or extend term contracts.",
        "The Company’s marine transportation segment could be adversely impacted by the construction of tank barges by its competitors. At the present time, there are an estimated 4,000 inland tank barges in the United States, of which the Company operates 1,066, or 27%. The number of tank barges peaked at an estimated 4,200 in 1982, slowly declined to 2,750 by 2003, and then gradually increased to an estimated 3,850 by the end of 2015 and 2016 and remained relatively flat since 2015.  For 2018, the Company estimated that industry-wide 75 new tank barges were placed in service, of which one was by the Company, and 100 tank barges were retired, 48 of which were by the Company.  For 2019, the Company estimated that industry-wide 150 new tank barges were placed in service, of which none were by the Company, and 100 tank barges were retired, 17 of which were by the Company.  For 2020, the Company estimated that industry-wide approximately 150 new tank barges were placed in service, six of which were purchased by the Company from another operator, and approximately 150 tank barges were retired, 95 of which were by the Company.  The increase for 2015 reflected the improved demand for inland petrochemical, refined petroleum products and black oil barges experienced in 2014 and federal tax incentives on new equipment. The decrease in the number of tank barges at the end of 2018 was primarily due to continued industry-wide tank barge retirements and minimal new tank barge construction. The Company estimates that approximately 35 new tank barges have been ordered during 2020 for delivery in 2021 and expects many older tank barges, including an expected 26 by the Company, will be retired, dependent on 2021 market conditions.",
        "The long-term risk of an oversupply of inland tank barges may be mitigated by the fact that the inland tank barge industry has approximately 350 tank barges that are over 30 years old and approximately 260 of those over 40 years old. Given the age profile of the industry inland tank barge fleet and extensive customer vetting standards, the expectation is that older tank barges will continue to be removed from service and replaced by new tank barges as needed, with the extent of both retirements and new builds dependent on petrochemical and refinery production levels and crude oil and natural gas condensate movements, both of which can have a direct effect on industry-wide tank barge utilization, as well as term and spot contract rates.",

        "During 2018, 2019, and 2020, a decline in industry-wide demand for the movement of crude oil and natural gas condensate transportation volumes increased available capacity and resulted in some reluctance among certain customers to extend term contracts, which led to an increase in the number of coastal vessels operating in the spot market. In addition, the Company and the industry added new coastal tank barge capacity during 2018, 2019, and 2020. Much of this new capacity is replacement capacity for older vessels anticipated to be retired.",
        "The Company estimates there are approximately 280 tank barges operating in the 195,000 barrels or less coastal industry fleet, the sector of the market in which the Company operates, and approximately 20 of those are over 25 years old.  In June 2018, the Company purchased a 155,000 barrel coastal ATB under construction from another operator that was delivered to the Company in the 2018 fourth quarter.  The Company is aware of three coastal ATBs placed in service in 2018, two in 2019, and one in 2020 by competitors.  There is currently one announced small specialized coastal ATB under construction by a competitor for delivery in 2021.",
        "Higher fuel prices could increase operating expenses and fuel price volatility could reduce profitability. The cost of fuel during 2020 was approximately 6% of marine transportation revenue. All of the Company’s marine transportation term contracts contain fuel escalation clauses, or the customer pays for the fuel. However, there is generally a 30 to 90 day delay before contracts are adjusted depending on the specific contract. In general, the fuel escalation clauses are effective over the long-term in allowing the Company to adjust to changes in fuel costs due to fuel price changes; however, the short-term effectiveness of the fuel escalation clauses can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, specific terms of the fuel escalation formulas, fuel price volatility, navigating conditions, tow sizes, trip routing, and the location of loading and discharge ports that may result in the Company over or under recovering its fuel costs. The Company’s spot contract rates generally reflect current fuel prices at the time the contract is signed but do not have escalators for fuel.",
        "Significant increases in the construction cost of tank barges and towing vessels may limit the Company’s ability to earn an adequate return on its investment in new tank barges and towing vessels. The price of steel, economic conditions, and supply and demand dynamics can significantly impact the construction cost of new tank barges and towing vessels. Over the last 20 years, the Company’s average construction price for a new 30,000 barrel capacity inland tank barge has fluctuated up or down significantly. For example, the average construction price for a new 30,000 barrel capacity tank barge in 2009 was approximately 90% higher than in 2000, with increases primarily related to higher steel costs. During 2009, the United States and global recession negatively impacted demand levels for inland tank barges and as a result, the construction price of inland tank barges fell significantly in 2010, primarily due to a significant decrease in steel prices, as well as a decrease in the number of tank barges ordered. In 2018 through 2020, increases in steel costs and improvement in supply and demand dynamics resulted in construction prices for a new 30,000 barrel tank barge increasing compared to prices in 2017 when there was an industry-wide over-capacity of inland tank barges in the market.",
        "The Company’s marine transportation segment could be adversely impacted by the failure of the Company’s shipyard vendors to deliver new vessels according to contractually agreed delivery schedules and terms. The Company contracts with shipyards to build new vessels and currently has many vessels under construction. Construction projects are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns, resulting from shortages of equipment, materials and skilled labor; lack of shipyard availability; unforeseen design and engineering problems; work stoppages; weather interference; unanticipated cost increases; unscheduled delays in the delivery of material and equipment; and financial and other difficulties at shipyards including labor disputes, shipyard insolvency and inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals. A significant delay in the construction of new vessels or a shipyard’s inability to perform under the construction contract could negatively impact the Company’s ability to fulfill contract commitments and to realize timely revenues with respect to vessels under construction. Significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction could also adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  To date, the Company has not experienced significant shipyard delays associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including at its subsidiary, San Jac.",

The Company’s primary competitors are noncaptive inland tank barge operators and coastal operators. The Company also competes with companies who operate refined product and petrochemical pipelines, railroad tank cars and tractor-trailer tank trucks. Increased competition from any significant expansion of or additions to facilities or equipment by the Company’s competitors could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations.

        "Distribution and Services Segment Risk Factors",
        "The Company’s distribution and services segment could be adversely impacted by future legislation, executive or other governmental orders, or additional regulation of oil and gas extraction, including hydraulic fracturing practices. The Company, through its United and S&S subsidiaries, is a distributor and service provider of engine and transmission related products for the oil and gas services, power generation and transportation industries, and a manufacturer of oilfield service equipment, including pressure pumping units. The EPA is studying hydraulic fracturing practices, and legislation may be enacted by Congress that would authorize the EPA to impose additional regulations on hydraulic fracturing. In addition, a number of states have adopted or are evaluating the adoption of legislation or regulations governing hydraulic fracturing or byproducts of the fracturing process. In January 2021, the Secretary of the Interior ordered a 60-day pause on issuing new drilling permits and new leases on federal lands in response to a related executive order issued by President Biden, and it is uncertain what further action may be taken. Such federal or state legislation, executive or governmental orders, and/or regulations could materially impact customers’ operations and greatly reduce or eliminate demand for the Company’s pressure pumping fracturing equipment and related products. The Company is unable to predict whether future legislation or any other regulations will ultimately be enacted and, if so, the impact on the Company’s distribution and services segment.",
        "The Company’s distribution and services segment could be adversely impacted by the construction of pressure pumping units by its competitors. In early 2015, an estimated 21.0 million horsepower of pressure pumping units were working, or available to work, in North America. By late 2016, the working horsepower in North America had declined to an estimated 6.0 million, with an estimated 2.0 million horsepower scrapped, an estimated 2.0 million horsepower available for work and an estimated 12.5 million horsepower stacked, the large majority of which would require major service before being placed back in service. A significant drop in demand due to the low price of crude oil resulted in an oversupply in the pressure pumping market and negatively impacted the Company’s 2015 and 2016 results of operations. During 2017 and 2018, with the stabilization of crude oil prices in the $40 to $70 per barrel range, the United States land rig count improved and service intensity in the well completion business increased. As a result, the Company experienced a healthy rebound in service demand during 2018, particularly with pressure pumping unit remanufacturing and transmission overhauls, and with the acquisition of S&S in September 2017, the manufacture of oilfield service equipment, including pressure pumping units, and the sale of transmissions.  At the end of 2019, an estimated 15.0 million horsepower of pressure pumping units were working in North America, with an estimated 6.0 million horsepower available to work, and 3.0 million horsepower stacked and in need of major repair.  During 2020, a significant reduction in oilfield activity as a result of oil price volatility throughout 2019 and 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decrease to an estimated 6.0 million horsepower of pressure pumping units working in North America, with an estimated 1.5 million horsepower available to work, and 12.0 million horsepower stacked and in need of major repair.  Increased expansion of, or additions to, facilities or equipment by the Company’s competitors could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations.",
        "Prevailing natural gas and crude oil prices, as well as the volatility of their prices, could have an adverse effect on the distribution and services segment business. Lower energy prices generally result in a decrease in the number of oil and gas wells being drilled. Oilfield service companies reduce their capital spending, resulting in decreased demand for new parts and equipment, including pressure pumping units, provided by the Company’s distribution and services segment. This may also lead to order cancellations from customers or customers requesting to delay delivery of new equipment. The Company also services offshore supply vessels and offshore drillings rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as internationally. Low energy prices may negatively impact the number of wells drilled in the Gulf of Mexico and international waters. Prolonged downturns in oil and gas prices may cause substantial declines in oilfield service and exploration expenditures and could adversely impact oil and gas manufacturing, remanufacturing, parts and distribution business. In addition, energy price volatility may also result in difficulties in the Company’s ability to ramp up and ramp down production on a timely basis and, therefore, could result in an adverse impact on the Company’s distribution and services segment.",

The segment’s oil and gas market’s principal competitors are independent distribution and service and oilfield manufacturing companies and other factory-authorized distributors and service centers. In addition, certain oilfield service companies that are customers of the Company also manufacture and service a portion of their own oilfield equipment. Increased competition in the distribution and services industry and continued low price of natural gas, crude oil or natural gas condensate, and resulting decline in drilling for such natural resources in North American shale formations, could result in less oilfield equipment being manufactured and remanufactured, lower rates for service and parts pricing and result in less manufacturing, remanufacturing, service and repair opportunities and parts sales for the Company. For the commercial and industrial market, the segment’s primary marine diesel competitors are independent diesel services companies and other factory-authorized distributors, authorized service centers and authorized marine dealers. Certain operators of diesel powered marine equipment also elect to maintain in-house service capabilities. For power generation, the primary competitors are other independent service companies.",
        "Loss of a distributorship or other significant business relationship could adversely affect the Company’s distribution and services segment.  The Company’s distribution and services segment has had a relationship with EMD, the largest manufacturer of medium-speed diesel engines, for over 50 years. The Company, through Kirby Engine Systems, serves as both an EMD distributor and service center for select markets and locations for both service and parts. With the acquisition of S&S in September 2017, the Company added additional EMD exclusive distributorship rights in key states, primarily through the Central, South and Eastern areas of the United States. With the S&S acquisition, the Company became the United States distributor for EMD marine and power generation applications. Sales and service of EMD products account for approximately 4% of the Company’s revenues for 2020. Although the Company considers its relationship with EMD to be strong, the loss of the EMD distributorship and service rights, or a disruption of the supply of EMD parts, could have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to service its customers. In 2020, with the acquisition of Convoy Servicing Company and Agility Fleet Services, LLC, the Company expanded its dealership network of Thermo King refrigeration systems for trucks, railroad cars, and other land transportation markets in Texas and Colorado.  In 2020, sales and service of Thermo King products comprised approximately 5% of the Company’s revenues.",

In addition, as distributors of Allison products, United and S&S have exclusive distribution rights in multiple key growth states. United and S&S are also the distributor for parts, service and warranty on Daimler truck engines and related equipment in multiple states. Sales and service of MTU, Allison, and Daimler products accounted for approximately 8% of the Company’s revenues during 2020. Although the Company considers its relationships with MTU, Allison, and Daimler to be strong, the loss of MTU, Allison, or Daimler distributorships and service rights, or a disruption of the supply of MTU or Allison parts, could have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to service its customers.",
        "In addition to its relationships with MTU, Allison, and Daimler, the Company also has relationships with many other distributors and parts suppliers and the loss of a distributorship and service rights, or a disruption of the supply of parts from any of these other distributors or part suppliers could also have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to service its customers.",
        "General Risk Factors",
        "The Company is subject to adverse weather conditions in its marine transportation and distribution and services segments. The Company’s marine transportation segment is subject to weather condition volatility. Adverse weather conditions such as high or low water on the inland waterway systems, fog and ice, tropical storms, hurricanes, and tsunamis on both the inland waterway systems and throughout the United States coastal waters can impair the operating efficiencies of the marine fleet. Such adverse weather conditions can cause a delay, diversion or postponement of shipments of products and are totally beyond the control of the Company.  Tropical storms and hurricanes may also impact the Company’s customers resulting in reduced demand for the Company’s services. In addition, adverse water and weather conditions can negatively affect a towing vessel’s performance, tow size, loading drafts, fleet efficiency, limit navigation periods and dictate horsepower requirements. The Company’s distribution and services segment is also subject to tropical storms and hurricanes impacting its coastal locations and those of its customers as well as tornadoes impacting its Oklahoma facilities. The risk of flooding as a result of hurricanes and tropical storms as well as other weather events may impede travel via roadways, suspend service work, and impact deliveries and the Company’s ability to fulfill orders or provide services in the distribution and services segment.",

The Company has made asset and business acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions of assets or businesses in the future that complement or expand the Company’s current business. The Company may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if attractive acquisition opportunities are identified, the Company may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms. The success of any completed acquisition depends on the Company’s ability to integrate the acquired assets or business effectively into the Company’s existing operations. The process of integrating acquired assets or businesses may involve difficulties that require a disproportionate amount of the Company’s managerial and financial resources to resolve. The value of acquired assets or businesses may be negatively impacted by a variety of circumstances unknown to the Company prior to the acquisition. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. The Company’s failure to achieve synergies, to integrate successfully the acquired businesses and assets into the Company’s existing operations, or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, agreements governing the Company’s indebtedness from time to time may impose certain limitations on the Company’s ability to undertake acquisitions or make investments or may limit the Company’s ability to incur certain indebtedness and liens, which could limit the Company’s ability to make acquisitions.",
        "The Company’s failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), or similar local applicable anti-bribery laws, could have a negative impact on its ongoing operations. The Company’s operations outside the United States require the Company to comply with both a number of United States and international regulations. For example, in addition to any similar applicable local anti-bribery laws, its operations in countries outside the United States are subject to the FCPA, which prohibits United States companies or their employees and third party representatives from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity, or obtain any unfair advantage. The Company has internal control policies and procedures and has implemented training and compliance programs for its employees and third party representatives with respect to the FCPA. However, the Company’s policies, procedures and programs may not always protect it from reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees or third party representatives, and severe criminal or civil sanctions could be the result of violations of the FCPA or any other applicable anti-bribery law in countries where the Company does business. The Company is also subject to the risks that its employees, joint venture partners, and third party representatives outside of the United States may fail to comply with other applicable laws.",
        "The Company is subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation, regulation and international accords. Greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon emissions or energy use, have increasingly become the subject of a large amount of international, national, regional, state and local attention. Pursuant to an April 2007 decision of the United States Supreme Court, the EPA was required to consider if carbon dioxide was a pollutant that endangers public health. On December 7, 2009, the EPA issued its “endangerment finding” regarding greenhouse gasses under the CAA. The EPA found that the emission of six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (which is emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels), may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. Based on this finding, the EPA defined the mix of these six greenhouse gases to be “air pollution” subject to regulation under the CAA. Although the EPA has stated a preference that greenhouse gas regulation be based on new federal legislation rather than the existing CAA, many sources of greenhouse gas emissions may be regulated without the need for further legislation.",
        "The United States Congress has considered in the past legislation that would create an economy-wide “cap-and-trade” system that would establish a limit (or cap) on overall greenhouse gas emissions and create a market for the purchase and sale of emissions permits or “allowances.” Any proposed cap-and-trade legislation would likely affect the chemical industry due to anticipated increases in energy costs as fuel providers pass on the cost of the emissions allowances, which they would be required to obtain under cap-and-trade to cover the emissions from fuel production and the eventual use of fuel by the Company or its energy suppliers. In addition, cap-and-trade proposals would likely increase the cost of energy, including purchases of diesel fuel, steam and electricity, and certain raw materials used or transported by the Company. Proposed domestic and international cap-and-trade systems could materially increase raw material and operating costs of the Company’s customer base. Future environmental regulatory developments related to climate change in the United States that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could result in financial impacts on the Company’s operations that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.",

        "A deterioration of the Company’s credit profile, disruptions of the credit markets or higher interest rates could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt.  Deterioration in the Company’s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs. If the Company’s credit profile deteriorates significantly its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, its cost of debt may increase, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms. Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its Revolving Credit Facility to support its operations as needed, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds on acceptable terms could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the pricing grids on Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan contain a ratings grid that includes a possible increase in borrowing rates if the Company’s rating declines. Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its Revolving Credit Facility based on floating rates. Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, which would adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations. In addition, as the floating rate on certain borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is tied to LIBOR, the uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR as well as the transition from LIBOR to an alternate benchmark rate or rates could adversely affect the Company’s financing costs.",

        "For purposes of Management’s Discussion, all net earnings per share attributable to Kirby common stockholders are “diluted earnings per share.” The weighted average number of common shares outstanding applicable to diluted earnings per share for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 59,912,000, 59,909,000 and 59,689,000, respectively.",
        "Overview",
        "The Company is the nation’s largest domestic tank barge operator, transporting bulk liquid products throughout the Mississippi River System, on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, coastwise along all three United States coasts, and in Alaska and Hawaii. The Company transports petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals by tank barge. As of December 31, 2020, the Company operated a fleet of 1,066 inland tank barges with 24.1 million barrels of capacity, and operated an average of 248 inland towboats during the 2020 fourth quarter. The Company’s coastal fleet consisted of 44 tank barges with 4.2 million barrels of capacity and 44 coastal tugboats. The Company also owns and operates four offshore dry-bulk cargo barges, four offshore tugboats and one docking tugboat transporting dry-bulk commodities in United States coastal trade. Through its distribution and services segment, the Company provides after-market service and parts for engines, transmissions, reduction gears, and related equipment used in oilfield services, marine, power generation, on-highway, and other industrial applications. The Company also rents equipment including generators, industrial compressors, railcar movers, and high capacity lift trucks for use in a variety of industrial markets, and manufactures and remanufactures oilfield service equipment, including pressure pumping units, for land-based oilfield service customers.",
        "For 2020, net loss attributable to Kirby was $272,546,000, or $4.55 per share, on revenues of $2,171,408,000, compared to 2019 net earnings attributable to Kirby of $142,347,000, or $2.37 per share, on revenues of $2,838,399,000. The 2020 first quarter included $561,274,000 before taxes, $433,341,000 after taxes, or $7.24 per share, non-cash charges related to inventory write-downs, impairment of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and property and equipment, and impairment of goodwill in the distribution and services segment.  See Note 7, Impairments and Other Charges for additional information.  In addition, the 2020 first quarter was favorably impacted by an income tax benefit of $50,824,000, or $0.85 per share related to net operating losses generated in 2018 and 2019 used to offset taxable income generated between 2013 and 2017.  See Note 9, Taxes on Income for additional information.  The 2019 fourth quarter included $35,525,000 before taxes, $27,978,000 after taxes, or $0.47 per share, non-cash inventory write-downs and $4,757,000 before taxes, $3,747,000 after taxes, or $0.06 per share, severance and early retirement expense.",
        "Marine Transportation",
        "For 2020, 65% of the Company’s revenues were generated by its marine transportation segment. The segment’s customers include many of the major petrochemical and refining companies that operate in the United States. Products transported include intermediate materials used to produce many of the end products used widely by businesses and consumers — plastics, fibers, paints, detergents, oil additives and paper, among others, as well as residual fuel oil, ship bunkers, asphalt, gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, crude oil, natural gas condensate and agricultural chemicals. Consequently, the Company’s marine transportation business is directly affected by the volumes produced by the Company’s petroleum, petrochemical and refining customer base.",

        "The Company’s marine transportation segment’s revenues for 2020 decreased 12% compared to 2019 and operating income decreased 24%, compared to 2019. The decreases were primarily due to reduced barge utilization in the inland and coastal markets and decreased term and spot contract pricing in the inland market, each as a result of a reduction in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lower fuel rebills, retirements of three large coastal barges, and planned shipyard activity in the coastal market. These reductions were partially offset by the acquisition of the Savage Inland Marine, LLC (“Savage”) fleet acquired on April 1, 2020 and the Cenac Marine Services, LLC (“Cenac”) fleet acquired on March 14, 2019. The 2020 third quarter was impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms along the East and Gulf Coasts and the closure of the Illinois river. The 2020 first quarter and 2019 first six months were each impacted by poor operating conditions and high delay days due to heavy fog and wind along the Gulf Coast, high water on the Mississippi River System, and closures of key waterways as a result of lock maintenance projects, as well as increased shipyard days on large capacity coastal vessels. The 2019 first six months was also impacted by prolonged periods of ice on the Illinois River and a fire at a chemical storage facility on the Houston Ship Channel.  For 2020 and 2019, the inland tank barge fleet contributed 78% and 77%, respectively, and the coastal fleet contributed 22% and 23%, respectively, of marine transportation revenues.",
        "During 2020, reduced demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic slowdown contributed to lower barge utilization. Inland tank barge utilization levels averaged in the low to mid-90% range during the 2020 first quarter, the mid-80% range during the 2020 second quarter, the low 70% range during the 2020 third quarter, and the high 60% range during the 2020 fourth quarter.  For 2019, barge utilization averaged in the mid-90% range during both the first and second quarters and the low 90% range during both the third and fourth quarters.  The 2020 first quarter and full year 2019 each experienced strong demand from petrochemicals, black oil, and refined petroleum products customers.  Extensive delay days due to poor operating conditions and lock maintenance projects in the 2020 first quarter and 2019 first six months slowed the transport of customer cargoes and contributed to strong barge utilization during those periods.",
        "Coastal tank barge utilization levels averaged in the low to mid-80% range during the 2020 first quarter and the mid-70% range during each of the 2020 second, third, and fourth quarters. In 2019, barge utilization averaged in the low 80% range during the first quarter and the mid-80% range during each of the second, third, and fourth quarters. Barge utilization in the coastal marine fleet continued to be impacted by the oversupply of smaller tank barges in the coastal industry during 2020 and 2019.",
        "During both 2020 and 2019, approximately 65% of the inland marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and 35% were spot contract revenues.  These allocations provide the operations with a reasonably predictable revenue stream. Inland time charters, which insulate the Company from revenue fluctuations caused by weather and navigational delays and temporary market declines, represented 66% of the inland revenues under term contracts during 2020 compared to 62% during 2019. Rates on inland term contracts renewed in the 2020 first quarter increased in the 1% to 3% average range compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 first quarter.  Rates on inland term contracts renewed in the 2020 second quarter were flat compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 second quarter.  Rates on inland term contracts renewed in the 2020 third quarter decreased in the 1% to 3% average range compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 third quarter.  Rates on inland term contracts renewed in the 2020 fourth quarter decreased in the 10% to 12% average range compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 fourth quarter.  Spot contract rates in the 2020 first quarter increased in the 4% to 6% average range compared to the 2019 first quarter. Spot contract rates in the 2020 second quarter decreased in the 5% to 10% average range compared to the 2019 second quarter.  Spot contract rates in the 2020 third quarter decreased approximately 10% compared to the 2019 third quarter. Spot contract rates in the 2020 fourth quarter decreased approximately 25% compared to the 2019 fourth quarter. There was no material rate increase on January 1, 2020, related to annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of inland multi-year contracts.",
        "During 2020 and 2019, approximately 85% and 80%, respectively, of the coastal revenues were under term contracts and 15% and 20%, respectively, were spot contract revenues. Coastal time charters represented approximately 90% of coastal revenues under term contracts during 2020 compared to 85% during 2019.  Spot and term contract pricing in the coastal market are contingent on various factors including geographic location, vessel capacity, vessel type and product serviced.  Rates on coastal term contracts renewed in the 2020 first quarter increased in the 10% to 15% average range compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 first quarter.  Rates on coastal term contracts renewed in the 2020 second quarter were flat compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 second quarter.  Rates on coastal term contracts renewed in both the 2020 third and fourth quarters decreased in the 4% to 6% average range compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 third and fourth quarters. Spot market rates in the 2020 first quarter increased in the 10% to 15% average range compared to the 2019 first quarter.  Spot market rates in each of the 2020 second, third, and fourth quarters were flat compared to the 2019 second, third, and fourth quarters.",

        "During 2020, the distribution and services segment generated 35% of the Company’s revenues, of which 93% was generated from service and parts and 7% from manufacturing. The results of the distribution and services segment are largely influenced by cycles of the land-based oilfield service and oil and gas operator and producer markets, marine, power generation, on-highway and other industrial markets.",
        "Distribution and services revenues for 2020 decreased 39% compared to 2019 and operating income decreased 118% compared to 2019. The decreases were primarily attributable to reduced activity in the oilfield as a result of oil price volatility throughout 2019 and 2020, the extensive downturn in oil and gas exploration due to low oil prices, caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, an oversupply of pressure pumping equipment in North America, and reduced spending and enhanced cash flow discipline for the Company’s major oilfield customers.  As a result, customer demand and incremental orders for new and remanufactured pressure pumping equipment and sales of new and overhauled transmissions and related parts and service declined during 2020.  For 2020, the oil and gas market represented approximately 26% of distribution and services revenues.",
        "The 2020 commercial and industrial market revenues decreased compared to 2019, primarily due to reductions in on-highway and power generation service demand as a result of the COVID‑19 pandemic and the resulting economic slowdown and nationwide, state, and local stay-at-home orders, partially offset by contributions from the Convoy Servicing Company and Agility Fleet Services, LLC (collectively “Convoy”) acquisition on January 3, 2020.  Demand in the marine business was also down due to reduced major overhaul activity.  For 2020, the commercial and industrial market contributed 74% of the distribution and services revenues.",
        "The distribution and services operating margin for 2020 was (1.6)% compared to 5.4% for 2019.",
        "Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures",
        "The Company generated favorable operating cash flow during 2020 with net cash provided by operating activities of $444,940,000 compared to $511,813,000 of net cash provided by operating activities for 2019, a 13% decrease. The decline was driven by decreased revenues and operating income in both the marine transportation and distribution and services segments.  The decrease in the marine transportation segment was driven by decreased barge utilization in the inland and coastal markets and decreased term and spot contract pricing in the inland market, each as a result of a reduction in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the Savage acquisition in April 2020 and the Cenac acquisition in March 2019 and reduced costs. The decrease in the distribution and services segment was primarily attributable to reduced activity in the oilfield as a result of oil price volatility throughout 2019 and 2020, the extensive downturn in oil and gas exploration due to low oil prices, caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, an oversupply of pressure pumping equipment in North America, and reduced spending and enhanced cash flow discipline for the Company’s major oilfield customers. The decline was also partially offset by changes in certain operating assets and liabilities primarily related to reduced incentive compensation payouts in the 2020 first quarter and a larger decrease in trade accounts receivable compared to an increase during 2019, driven by reduced business activity levels in both the marine transportation and distribution and services segments.  In addition, during 2020, the Company received a tax refund of $30,606,000 for its 2018 tax return related to net operating losses being carried back to offset taxable income generated during 2013.  During 2020 and 2019, the Company generated cash of $17,310,000 and $57,657,000, respectively, from proceeds from the disposition of assets, and $353,000 and $5,743,000, respectively, from proceeds from the exercise of stock options.",
        "For 2020, cash generated and borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility were used for capital expenditures of $148,185,000, (including a decrease in accrued capital expenditures of $13,280,000) including $7,506,000 for inland towboat construction and $140,679,000 primarily for upgrading existing marine equipment and marine transportation and distribution and services facilities.

The Company also used $262,491,000 for acquisitions of businesses and marine equipment, more fully described under Acquisitions below.",
        "The Company’s debt-to-capitalization ratio increased to 32.2% at December 31, 2020 from 28.9% at December 31, 2019, primarily due to borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to acquire the Savage fleet in the 2020 second quarter and the Convoy acquisition in the 2020 first quarter as well as the decrease in total equity, primarily from the net loss attributable to Kirby for 2020 of $272,546,000. The Company’s debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 is detailed in Long-Term Financing below.",
        "During 2020, the Company acquired 92 inland tank barges from Savage with a total capacity of approximately 2.5 million barrels, purchased six newly constructed inland pressure barges, retired 94 inland tank barges, transferred one tank barge to coastal, returned two leased inland tank barges, and brought back into service 12 inland tank barges.  The net result was an increase of 13 inland tank barges and approximately 0.7 million barrels of capacity during 2020.",
        "The Company projects that capital expenditures for 2021 will be in the $125,000,000 to $145,000,000 range.  The 2021 construction program will consist of approximately $15,000,000 for the construction of new inland towboats, $95,000,000 to $110,000,000 primarily for capital upgrades and improvements to existing marine equipment and facilities, and $15,000,000 to $20,000,000 for new machinery and equipment, facilities improvements, and information technology projects in the distribution and services segment and corporate.",
        "Outlook",
        "While there remains significant uncertainty around the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company expects improved business activity and utilization levels in the second half of 2021.  The first half of 2021 is expected to remain challenging until the pandemic eases and refinery utilization materially recovers and the U.S. economy rebounds.  In the first quarter, the Company expects weak market conditions in marine transportation to continue with pricing pressure on contract renewals.  Additionally, surging cases of COVID-19 across the United States have impacted the Company’s ability to crew its vessels, resulting in delays and in some cases, lost revenue primarily impacting the Company’s offshore vessels. As a result, first quarter 2021 earnings are expected to decline sequentially with improving results thereafter as the effects of the pandemic moderate and demand for the Company’s products and services increases.",
        "In the inland marine transportation market, conditions are expected to remain challenging in the coming months, with gradual improvement in the second quarter and a more meaningful recovery in the second half of 2021.  Barge utilization is projected to start the year in the low to mid-70% range and improve into the high 80% to low 90% range by the end of the year.  Pricing, which typically improves with barge utilization, is expected to remain under pressure in the near-term.  First quarter revenues and operating margin are expected to be the lowest of the year, sequentially down from the 2020 fourth quarter due to the impact of lower pricing on term contract renewals and increased delays from seasonal winter weather.  Anticipated improvements in the spot market later in 2021 should contribute to increased barge utilization and better operating margins as the year progresses.  However, the full year impact of lower term contract pricing is expected to result in full year operating margins lower than the mid-teens margins realized in 2020.",
        "As of December 31, 2020, the Company estimated there were approximately 4,000 inland tank barges in the industry fleet, of which approximately 350 were over 30 years old and approximately 260 of those over 40 years old. The Company estimates that approximately 35 new tank barges have been ordered for delivery in 2021 and many older tank barges, including an expected 26 by the Company, will be retired, dependent on 2021 market conditions. Historically, 75 to 150 older inland tank barges are retired from service each year industry-wide.  The extent of the retirements is dependent on petrochemical and refinery production levels, and crude oil and natural gas condensate movements, both of which can have a direct effect on industry-wide tank barge utilization, as well as term and spot contract rates.",

        "In the coastal marine transportation market, with limited spot demand and the return of some term equipment, lower term contract pricing, crewing difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the retirement of three older large capacity coastal vessels during 2020, and the retirement of an additional vessel in mid-2021, financial results are expected to be lower in 2021 than 2020. In the 2021 first quarter, the Company expects coastal revenues and operating margin to decline compared to the 2020 fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of lower term contract pricing and challenges crewing vessels due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the full year, coastal revenues are expected to decline compared to 2020 with negative operating margins, the magnitude of which will be dependent on the timing of a material improvement in refined products and black oil demand later in 2021.",
        "As of December 31, 2020, the Company estimated there were approximately 280 tank barges operating in the 195,000 barrels or less coastal industry fleet, the sector of the market in which the Company operates, and approximately 20 of those were over 25 years old. The Company is aware of one announced small specialized coastal ATB in the 195,000 barrels or less category under construction by a competitor for delivery in 2021.",
        "The results of the distribution and services segment are largely influenced by the cycles of the land-based oilfield service and oil and gas operator and producer markets, marine, power generation, on-highway and other industrial markets.  Improving economic activity and growth in the oilfield are expected to boost activity levels and contribute to meaningful year-over-year improvement in revenue and operating income.  In commercial and industrial, revenues are expected to benefit from improving economic conditions as well as from growth in the on-highway market, due in part to the Company’s new online parts sales platform which was launched in 2020.  However, these gains are expected to be partially offset by lower sales of new marine engines which remained strong throughout 2020.",
        "In the distribution and services oil and gas market, higher commodity prices and increasing well completions activity are expected to contribute to improved demand for new transmission, service, and parts, as well as higher pressure pumping remanufacturing activity.  Additionally, a heightened focus on sustainability across the energy sector and industrial complex is expected to result in continued growth in new orders for Kirby’s portfolio of environmentally friendly equipment during the year.  Overall, operating margins in distribution and services are expected to be positive in the low to mid-single digits for the full year with the first quarter being the lowest and the third quarter being the highest prior to normal seasonal declines in the fourth quarter.",
        "While the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the Company’s business, to date, it has not materially adversely impacted its ability to conduct its operations in either business segment.  The Company has maintained business continuity and expects to continue to do so.",
        "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates",
        "The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates based on different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are described below. It is also suggested that the Company’s significant accounting policies, as described in the Company’s financial statements in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, be read in conjunction with this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.",
        "Accounts Receivable. The Company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business. The Company regularly reviews its accounts and estimates the amount of uncollectible receivables each period and establishes an allowance for uncollectible amounts. The amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts, information about the current financial strength of customers, and other relevant information. Estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period, and changes are recorded in the period they become known. Historically, credit risk with respect to these trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the financial strength of the Company’s customers; however, a United States or global recession or other adverse economic condition could impact the collectability of certain customers’ trade receivables which could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.",

        "Property, Maintenance and Repairs. Property is recorded at cost; improvements and betterments are capitalized as incurred. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets. When property items are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included in the statement of earnings. Maintenance and repairs on vessels built for use on the inland waterways are charged to operating expense as incurred and includes the costs incurred in USCG inspections unless the shipyard extends the life or improves the operating capacity of the vessel which results in the costs being capitalized. The Company’s ocean-going vessels are subject to regulatory drydocking requirements after certain periods of time to be inspected, have planned major maintenance performed and be recertified by the ABS. These recertifications generally occur twice in a five-year period. The Company defers the drydocking expenditures incurred on its ocean-going vessels due to regulatory marine inspections by the ABS and amortizes the costs of the shipyard over the period between drydockings, generally 30 or 60 months, depending on the type of major maintenance performed. Drydocking expenditures that extend the life or improve the operating capability of the vessel result in the costs being capitalized. Routine repairs and maintenance on ocean-going vessels are expensed as incurred. Interest is capitalized on the construction of new ocean-going vessels.",
        "The Company performs an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If a triggering event is identified, the Company compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company measures the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to its estimated fair value.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss, if any. The assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, estimated fair market value of the assets and estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service the asset will be used, and estimated salvage values. Although the Company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable, deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result.",
        "Goodwill. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in transactions accounted for as a purchase is included in goodwill. Management monitors the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary. The amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is typically measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using an appropriate discount rate and valued based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, incorporating all tax impacts caused by the recognition of the impairment loss. The assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss, if any. Although the Company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable, deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result.",
        "Accrued Insurance. The Company is subject to property damage and casualty risks associated with operating vessels carrying large volumes of bulk liquid and dry cargo in a marine environment. The Company maintains insurance coverage against these risks subject to a deductible, below which the Company is liable. In addition to expensing claims below the deductible amount as incurred, the Company also maintains a reserve for losses that may have occurred but have not been reported to the Company, or are not yet fully developed. The Company uses historic experience and actuarial analysis by outside consultants to estimate an appropriate level of accrued liabilities. If the actual number of claims and magnitude were substantially greater than assumed, the required level of accrued liabilities for claims incurred but not reported or fully developed could be materially understated. The Company records receivables from its insurers for incurred claims above the Company’s deductible. If the solvency of the insurers became impaired, there could be an adverse impact on the accrued receivables and the availability of insurance.",

        "Marine transportation revenues for 2020 decreased 12% compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to reduced barge utilization in the inland and coastal markets and decreased term and spot contract pricing in the inland market, each as a result of a reduction in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lower fuel rebills, retirements of three large coastal barges, and planned shipyard activity in the coastal market. These reductions were partially offset by the acquisition of the Savage fleet acquired on April 1, 2020 and the Cenac fleet acquired on March 14, 2019. The 2020 third quarter was impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms along the East and Gulf Coasts and the closure of the Illinois River. The 2020 first quarter and 2019 first six months were each impacted by poor operating conditions and high delay days due to heavy fog and wind along the Gulf Coast, high water on the Mississippi River System, and closures of key waterways as a result of lock maintenance projects, as well as increased shipyard days on large capacity coastal vessels. The 2019 first six months was also impacted by prolonged periods of ice on the Illinois River and a fire at a chemical storage facility on the Houston Ship Channel.  For 2020 and 2019, the inland tank barge fleet contributed 78% and 77%, respectively, and the coastal fleet contributed 22% and 23%, respectively, of marine transportation revenues.  The Savage fleet was quickly integrated into the Company’s own fleet and the former Savage equipment began operating under Company contracts soon after the acquisition closed, with former Savage barges working with the Company’s existing towboats and vice versa resulting in differences in vessel utilization and pricing among individual assets and the consolidated fleet.  Due to this quick integration, it is not practical to provide a specific amount of revenues for the Savage fleet but the acquisition in April 2020 was one of the factors that offset decreases in marine transportation revenues in 2020 as compared to 2019.",

Barge utilization in the coastal marine fleet continued to be impacted by the oversupply of smaller tank barges in the coastal industry during 2020 and 2019.",
        "The petrochemical market, the Company’s largest market, contributed 52% of marine transportation revenues for 2020, reflecting reduced volumes from Gulf Coast petrochemical plants for both domestic consumption and to terminals for export destinations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Also, during the 2020 third quarter, the petrochemical complex along the Gulf Coast was impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms, reducing barge volumes and closing critical waterways for extended periods of time. During 2020, U.S. chemical plant capacity utilization declined to an average in the low to mid-70% range.",
        "The black oil market, which contributed 26% of marine transportation revenues for 2020, reflected reduced demand as refinery production levels and the export of refined petroleum products and fuel oils declined as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact from hurricanes and tropical storms along the Gulf Coast during the third and fourth quarters.  During 2020, U.S. refinery utilization peaked in the low to mid-90% range early in the first quarter and troughed in the high 60% range during the second quarter.  During the third and fourth quarters, refinery utilization stabilized in the low 70% to low 80% range with the low end resulting from significant hurricane and tropical storm activity along the Gulf Coast during September and October and increased to the low 80% range late in the fourth quarter.  During 2020, the Company continued to transport crude oil and natural gas condensate produced from the Permian Basin as well as reduced volumes from the Eagle Ford shale formation in Texas, both along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway with inland vessels and in the Gulf of Mexico with coastal equipment. Additionally, the Company transported volumes of Utica natural gas condensate downriver from the Mid-Atlantic to the Gulf Coast and Canadian and Bakken crude downriver from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast.",

        "For 2020, the inland operations incurred 10,408 delay days, 22% fewer than the 13,259 delay days that occurred during 2019.  Delay days measure the lost time incurred by a tow (towboat and one or more tank barges) during transit when the tow is stopped due to weather, lock conditions, or other navigational factors. Reduced delay days during 2020 is primarily due to lower barge utilization, despite significant delays associated with hurricane activity along the Gulf Coast during the third quarter. In addition, delay days for the 2020 first quarter and 2019 first six months reflected poor operating conditions due to heavy fog and wind along the Gulf Coast, high water conditions on the Mississippi River System, and closures of key waterways as a result of lock maintenance projects.  The 2019 first six months was also impacted by prolonged periods of ice on the Illinois River and a fire at a chemical storage facility on the Houston Ship Channel.",

The decrease was primarily due to the chartered towboats released during the 2020 second and third quarters, partially offset by the addition of inland towboats with the Savage acquisition in April 2020. Generally, as demand or anticipated demand increases or decreases, as tank barges are added to or removed from the fleet, as chartered towboat availability changes, or as weather or water conditions dictate, the Company charters in or releases chartered towboats in an effort to balance horsepower needs with current requirements.

Partially offsetting the increase were unusually poor operating conditions due to heavy fog along the Gulf Coast, prolonged periods of ice on the Illinois River, high water on the Mississippi River System, closures of key waterways as a result of lock maintenance projects, extended delays in the Houston Ship Channel, and increased shipyard days on several large capacity coastal vessels during the 2019 first and fourth quarters.  For 2019 and 2018, the inland tank barge fleet contributed 77% and 76%, respectively, and the coastal fleet 23% and 24%, respectively, of marine transportation revenues. The Cenac fleet was quickly integrated into the Company’s own fleet and the Cenac equipment began to operate on the Company’s contracts soon after the acquisition and Cenac barges worked with the Company’s towboats and vice versa resulting in differences in vessel utilization and pricing among individual assets and the consolidated fleet. Due to this quick integration, it is not practical to provide a specific amount of revenues for Cenac but the acquisition in March 2019 was one of the factors that drove increases in marine transportation revenues in 2019 as compared to 2018.",
        "Tank barge utilization levels in the Company’s inland marine transportation markets averaged the mid-90% range during both the 2019 first and second quarters and low 90% range during both the 2019 third and fourth quarters. Strong demand from petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals customers, along with extensive delay days due to poor operating conditions which slowed the transport of customer cargoes, contributed to increased barge utilization during the 2019 first and second quarters.  Better weather during the 2019 third quarter and receding flood waters on the Mississippi River System resulted in fewer delay days and contributed to modestly lower barge utilization during the 2019 third quarter. In the 2019 fourth quarter, weather conditions seasonally deteriorated, however, reduced refinery and chemical plant utilization for many of the Company’s major customers resulted in tank barge utilization remaining in the low 90% range for the quarter.",

        "Costs and expenses for 2020 decreased 34% compared to 2019.  Costs of sales and operating expenses for 2020 decreased 39% compared to 2019, reflecting lower demand for new and overhauled transmissions and related parts and service and reduced demand for new pressure pumping equipment in the oil and gas market.",
        "Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2020 decreased 3% compared to 2019.  The decrease was primarily due to cost reduction initiatives throughout the organization as a result of reduced business activity levels due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the Convoy acquisition, a bad debt expense charge of $3,339,000 as a result of the bankruptcy of a large oil and gas customer, and $1,354,000 of severance expense as a result of continued workforce reductions, each recorded during the 2020 second quarter.",
        "Depreciation and amortization for 2020 decreased 22% compared to 2019.  The decrease was primarily due to lower amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill, which were impaired during the 2020 first quarter.",
        "Distribution and Services Operating Income (Loss) and Operating Margins",
        "Operating income for the distribution and services segment for 2020 decreased 118% compared to 2019.  The operating margin was (1.6)% for 2020 compared to 5.4% for 2019. The results primarily reflected a decrease in margins in the commercial and industrial market and losses in the oil and gas market.",
        "2019 Compared to 2018",
        "Distribution and Services Revenues",
        "Distribution and services revenues for 2019 decreased 16% compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to reduced activity in the oilfield as a result of oil price volatility in late 2018 and early 2019, an oversupply of pressure pumping equipment in North America, and reduced spending and enhanced cash flow discipline for the Company’s major oilfield customers.  During the first half of 2019, although oilfield activity levels and new orders for the Company’s oilfield related products and services declined as compared to the same period in 2018, the segment benefited from a significant backlog of manufacturing orders for new and remanufactured pressure pumping equipment received in the 2018 third and fourth quarters.  Most of these orders were completed in the 2019 first and second quarters as oilfield activity levels further declined for many of the Company’s customers.  As a result, customer demand and incremental orders for new and remanufactured pressure pumping equipment declined significantly for the duration of 2019, and sales of new and overhauled transmissions and related parts and service were minimal during the 2019 third and fourth quarters.  For 2019, the oil and gas market represented approximately 53% of distribution and services revenues.",
        "The commercial and industrial market, which contributed 47% of distribution and services revenues for 2019, saw increased service levels and new engine sales in the marine repair business for much of the year, although activity levels in the inland market declined during the 2019 third quarter as many customers reduced maintenance activities following months of river flooding conditions and during the summer harvest season.  The commercial and industrial market also experienced increased demand for power generation equipment compared to 2018, including the sale and installation of significant back-up power systems for major data centers in the 2019 first and second quarters.  Activity levels for the Company’s specialty rental units, back-up power systems, and refrigeration equipment seasonally increased in anticipation of and as a result of summer storms and warm weather conditions in the 2019 second and third quarters.  Demand in the nuclear power generation market was stable compared to 2018.",

        "Costs and expenses for 2019 decreased 13%, compared to 2018. Costs of sales and operating expenses for 2019 decreased 14% compared to 2018, reflecting lower demand for new and remanufactured pressure pumping equipment and reduced demand for new and overhauled transmissions and related parts and service in the oil and gas market.",

        "The Company makes various assumptions when determining defined benefit plan costs including, but not limited to, the current discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Discount rates are determined annually and are based on a yield curve that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the projected benefit cash flows. The Company used discount rates of 2.8% for the Kirby pension plan and 2.9% for the Higman pension plan in 2020 and 3.5% for each plan in 2019, in determining its benefit obligations. The Company estimates that every 0.1% decrease in the discount rate results in an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) of approximately $8,631,000. The Company assumed that plan assets would generate a long-term rate of return of 6.75% and 7.0% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company developed its expected long-term rate of return assumption by evaluating input from investment consultants and comparing historical returns for various asset classes with its actual and targeted plan investments. The Company believes that long-term asset allocation, on average, will approximate the targeted allocation.",

The decline in 2020 was driven by decreased revenues and operating income in both the marine transportation and distribution and services segments.  The decrease in the marine transportation segment was driven by decreased barge utilization in the inland and coastal markets and decreased term and spot contract pricing in the inland market, each as a result of a reduction in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the Savage acquisition in April 2020 and the Cenac acquisition in March 2019.  The decline was also partially offset by changes in certain operating assets and liabilities primarily related to reduced incentive compensation payouts in the 2020 first quarter and a larger decrease in trade accounts receivable compared to 2019, driven by reduced business activity levels in both the marine transportation and distribution and services segments.  In addition, during 2020, the Company received a tax refund of $30,606,000 for its 2018 tax return related to net operating losses being carried back to offset taxable income generated during 2013.  During February 2021, the Company received a tax refund of $119,493,000, including accrued interest, for its 2019 tax return.",

The increase was also due to a net increase in cash flows from the change in operating assets and liabilities of $153,953,000, primarily due to a decrease in inventories reflecting reduced business activity levels in the distribution and services segment in 2019 compared to an increase in 2018.",

Given the inherent challenges involved in the construction of a project of this type, in particular by a company that has limited current operations, our human resources strategy focuses on the recruitment and retention of employees who have already established relevant expertise in the industry. The execution of this strategy has resulted in us assembling what we believe to be a premier management team in the global LNG industry. A related aspect of our human resources strategy is that the compensation structure for many of our employees is weighted towards incentive compensation that is designed to reward progress toward the development of our business, including in particular the financing and construction of the Driftwood Project."

Further, McDonald’s Hamburger University has eight campuses around the world to provide training for Company employees as well as franchisees and eligible employees from their organizations. These are just a few examples of how education plays an important role in our business and our communities.",

        "The Company embraces our role and commitment to the communities we serve. Throughout the past year, McDonald’s rallied together with our suppliers, franchisees and partners, not just to keep restaurants open and running safely, but also to support our communities and first responders as seen through our donations of food and masks. Through the Company’s Youth Opportunity program, we aim to reduce barriers to employment for many at risk young people, through pre-employment job readiness training, employment opportunities, and workplace development programs. We are also proud of the network of over 260 local Chapters of Ronald McDonald House Charities (“RMHC”) spanning over 60 countries and regions that creates, finds and supports programs that directly improve the health and well-being of children and their families. In support of RMHC, in 2020, the Company announced our five-year commitment to RMHC totaling $100 million. The Company will continue to look for ways to utilize our size and scale to create an even bigger impact in the communities we serve in the future.",

Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions. Those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and our general business practices. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the “informal eating out” (“IEO”) segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment, our brand, our culture, our operations, our suppliers, or our franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and our financial results may suffer.",

These risks include any increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. These risks also include any increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them.

If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or our competitors predict or respond more effectively, our financial results could be adversely impacted.",
        "Our ability to build upon our strengths and advantages also depends on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the System, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies, marketing plans, and the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy; however, they may not be successful, or may not be as successful as the efforts of our competitors, and could negatively impact sales, guest counts and market share.",
        "Additionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching our customers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels, including digital marketing, allows us to reach our customers effectively and efficiently, and in ways that are meaningful to them.

As part of these investments, we are placing renewed emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, mobile ordering and payment systems, and enhancing our drive thru technologies, which may not generate expected returns. We also continue to offer and refine our delivery initiatives, including through growing awareness and trial. Utilizing a third-party delivery service may not have the same level of profitability as a non-delivery transaction, and may introduce additional food quality and customer satisfaction risks. If these customer experience initiatives are not well executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer.",

It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results.

        "We encounter differing cultural, regulatory, geopolitical and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where McDonald’s restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the System's success in these environments. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our System’s ability to leverage operating successes across markets and brand perceptions. Planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with McDonald's customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts.",
        "Disruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or changes in trade-related tariffs or controls, sanctions and counter sanctions, government-mandated closure of our, our franchisees’ or our suppliers’ operations, and asset seizures. Trade policies, tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries could adversely affect our business and operations. These and other government actions may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm. Our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental actions.",
        "Additionally, challenges and uncertainties are associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. Such challenges may be exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. An inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.",
        "We may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets. For example, as a result of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities and uncertainty in European or worldwide economic conditions. The decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may or may not continue, and may result in increased supply chain costs for items that are imported from other countries. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.",
        "Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.",
        "We depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient supply of quality products on favorable terms. Although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions, including as a result of shortages and transportation issues or unexpected increases in demand, and price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers, franchisees or us. If we experience interruptions in our System’s supply chain, or if contingency planning is not effective, our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our System’s operations.",
        "Our franchise business model presents a number of risks.",
        "The Company's success as a heavily franchised business relies to a large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-operated restaurants. Our franchisees and developmental licensees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. In particular, our franchisees have also been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Company granted the deferral of cash collection for certain rent and royalties earned from franchisees in substantially all markets. If franchisee sales trends worsen, or do not improve at a sufficiently rapid rate, our financial results will continue to be negatively affected, which may be material.",
        "Our success also relies on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the Company or by banks’ lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.",
        "Our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.",
        "Our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.",

Increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in our Company-operated restaurants, as well as costs to promote awareness of the opportunities of working at McDonald's restaurants, could have a negative impact on our Company-operated margins. Similar concerns apply to our franchisees.",

These regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues, including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Claims of non-compliance with these regulations could result in liability and expense to us. Our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers, including those giving rise to claims of harassment or discrimination (or perceptions thereof) or workplace safety could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. Additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the McDonald's System and whose performance may have a material impact on our results.",

Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu and service model evolve. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, occur within the food industry and our System from time to time and could occur in the future.

We generally own or secure a long-term lease on the land and building for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites. We seek to identify and develop restaurant locations that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential. As we generally secure long-term real estate interests for our restaurants, we have limited flexibility to quickly alter our real estate portfolio. The competitive business landscape continues to evolve in light of changing business trends, consumer preferences, trade area demographics, consumer use of digital and delivery, local competitive positions and other economic factors. If our restaurants are not located in desirable locations, or if we do not evolve in response to these factors, it could adversely affect Systemwide sales and profitability.",
        "Our real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are also impacted by a variety of other factors, including governmental regulations; insurance; zoning, tax and eminent domain laws; interest rate levels and the cost of financing.

Any failure or interruption of these systems could significantly impact our franchisees’ operations, or our customers’ experience and perceptions. Additionally, we provide certain technology systems to businesses that are unaffiliated with the McDonald’s System and a failure, interruption or breach of these systems may cause harm to those unaffiliated parties, which may result in liability to the Company or reputational harm.",

Certain technology systems may also become vulnerable, unreliable or inefficient in cases where technology vendors limit or terminate product support and maintenance. Our increasing reliance on third party systems also present the risks faced by the third party’s business, including the operational, security and credit risks of those parties. If those systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, or if business continuity or disaster recovery plans were not effective, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we could experience an interruption in our or our franchisees’ operations.",

Many of our markets are subject to increasing, conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations involving, among other matters, restaurant operations, product packaging, marketing, the nutritional and allergen content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices. Compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers.

The standard replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in prior GAAP with a methodology that instead reflects a current estimate of all expected credit losses on financial assets, including receivables. The guidance requires that an entity measure and recognize expected credit losses at the time the asset is recorded, while considering a broader range of information to estimate credit losses including country specific macroeconomic conditions that correlate with historical loss experience, delinquency trends and aging behavior of receivables, among others. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2020, prospectively, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company had an Allowance for bad debts of $55.3 million as of December 31, 2020 recorded as a reduction to Accounts and notes receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. ",

The guidance was effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.",
        "REVENUE RECOGNITION",
        "The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company’s Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the McDonald’s brand, and third party revenues for the Dynamic Yield business.",
        "Sales by Company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term (with the exception of rent concessions as a result of COVID-19 – refer to the Leasing section that follows), and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Initial fees are recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.",
        "The Company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services we provide. The Company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred. Brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. Dynamic Yield third party revenues are generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and are recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service is performed.",
        "PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT",
        "Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings–up to 40 years; leasehold improvements–the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment–3 to 12 years.",
        "The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.",
        "The Company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees, primarily in the U.S. Since McDonald's manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the Company estimates which costs are the responsibility of McDonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between Property and equipment and Accounts receivable. Upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finalized and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense. ",

The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company’s estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using the rate implicit in each lease, if determinable, or a collateralized incremental borrowing rate considering the term of the lease and particular currency environment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, primarily related to leases of office equipment, are not included in the Lease right-or-use asset or Lease liability and continue to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.",
        "The Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in our lessee portfolio. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability, the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to Company-owned restaurant locations. For franchised locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-restaurant related leases such as office buildings, vehicles and office equipment. These leases are not a material subset of the Company’s lease portfolio.",

For the lessee portfolio, the Company elected not to remeasure the Lease right- of-use asset and Lease liability if a rent deferral or a rent abatement is granted. Refer to the Leasing Arrangements footnotes on page 52 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability.",
        "The Company deferred collection of approximately $490 million of rental income on revenue that was recognized in 2020, and has collected over 80% of these deferrals as of December 31, 2020.

        "CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE",
        "Capitalized software is stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which primarily ranges from 2 to 7 years. Customer facing software is typically amortized over a shorter useful life, while back office and Corporate systems may have a longer useful life. Capitalized software less accumulated amortization is recorded within Miscellaneous other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was (in millions): 2020-$691.2; 2019-$665.4; 2018-$609.7.",
        "The Company reviews capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable or if an indicator of impairment exists, which occurs more regularly throughout the year, such as when new software may be ready for its intended use. Results for the year ended 2020 reflected write-offs of impaired software that were no longer being used of $26.3 million.",
        "LONG-LIVED ASSETS",
        "Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonald’s restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a field office level, and internationally, at a market level. The Company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant’s cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.",
        "Losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses are related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered “held for sale\".",
        "GOODWILL",
        "Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurants and other businesses. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit.",

In the current period, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and did not identify any indicators of impairment.

While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance.

Minimum rent payments are based on the Company's underlying investment in owned sites and parallel the Company’s underlying leases and escalations on properties that are leased. Under the franchise arrangement, franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the McDonald’s System and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20 years. At the end of the 20-year franchise arrangement, the Company maintains control of the underlying real estate and building and can either enter into a new 20-year franchise arrangement with the existing franchisee or a different franchisee, or close the restaurant. Franchisees generally pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance.",

        "As described in the income taxes footnote to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, which includes transfer pricing matters, totaled $1,479.2 million at December 31, 2020. The Company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. Accordingly, tax liabilities are recorded when, in management’s judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on management’s assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. ",
        "Auditing the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing used in intercompany transactions was challenging because the measurement is based on judgmental interpretations of complex tax laws and legal rulings and because the pricing of the intercompany transactions is based on studies that may produce a range of outcomes (e.g., the price that would be charged in an arm’s-length transaction).",
        "How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit",
        "We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits and measure unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing used in intercompany transactions. For example, we tested management’s review of the unrecognized tax benefit calculations, which included evaluation of the comparable transactions used to determine the ranges of outcomes, pricing conclusions reached in management’s transfer pricing studies, and the assessment of other third-party information.",
        "With the assistance of our income tax professionals, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the technical merits of the Company’s position and testing the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing. For example, we assessed the inputs utilized and the pricing conclusions reached in the transfer pricing studies executed by management, and compared the methods used to alternative methods and industry benchmarks. We also reviewed the Company’s communications with the relevant tax authorities and any advice obtained by the Company from third-party advisors. In addition, we used our knowledge of historical settlement activity, income tax laws, and other market information to evaluate the technical merits of the positions and the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing.",

In addition, we use our social media channels, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, SlideShare and a Company blog on our website, as a means of sharing thought leadership content, disclosing information about the Company, our services and other topics important to our clients.  By staying ahead of the market trends and engaging with clients, we are able to identify possible opportunities to expand the services we are providing them as well as extend the current services we are providing.  In other cases, clients ask us to bid competitively. In both cases, we submit proposals to the client for evaluation. The period between submission of a proposal to final award can range from 30 days or less (generally for noncompetitive, short-term contracts), to a year or more (generally for large, competitive multi-year contracts).",

We anticipate that approximately 85 percent of our backlog as of December 31, 2020 will be recognized as revenue during 2021. However, the rate at which services are performed under certain contracts, and thus the rate at which backlog will be recognized, may be at the discretion of the client and most contracts are, as mentioned above, subject to termination by the client upon written notice.",

        "Our estimates of future staffing requirements depend in part on the timing of new contract awards.  We make our estimates in good faith, but our estimates could be inaccurate or change based upon new information.  In the case of larger projects, it is particularly difficult to predict whether we will receive a contract award and when the award will be announced.  In some cases the contracts that are awarded require staffing levels that are different, sometimes lower, than the levels anticipated when the work was proposed.  The uncertainty of contract award timing and changes in scope or funding can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contract needs.  If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, or if a contract is awarded for a smaller scope of work than proposed, we could incur significant costs associated with making or failing to make reductions in staff.",

Our consulting, technical training and engineering services require the employment of individuals with specific skills, training, licensure and backgrounds.  An inability to hire or maintain employees with the required skills, training, licensure or backgrounds could have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide quality services, to expand the scope of our service offerings or to attract or retain customers or to accept contracts, which could negatively impact our business and financial condition.  In order to initiate and develop client relationships and execute our growth strategy, we must continue to hire and maintain qualified salespeople.  We must also continue to attract and develop capable management personnel to guide our business and supervise the use of our resources. ",

An inability to hire or maintain employees with the required skills, work experience, licensure, security clearances or backgrounds could have a material adverse effect on our ability to win new contracts or satisfy existing contractual obligations, and could result in additional expenses or possible loss of revenue.

We cannot assure you that qualified personnel will continue to be available to us or will be available to us when our needs arise or on terms favorable to us.

U.S. federal regulation of banks, BHCs and financial holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors.",
        "As a registered financial holding company and BHC, the Corporation is subject to the supervision of, and regular inspection by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). Our U.S. bank subsidiaries (the Banks), organized as national banking associations, are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have adopted guidelines that establish minimum standards for the design, implementation and board oversight of BHCs’ and national banks’ risk governance frameworks. U.S. financial holding companies, and the companies under their control, are permitted to engage in activities considered “financial in nature” as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Reserve interpretations. The Corporation's status as a financial holding company is conditioned upon maintaining certain eligibility requirements for both the Corporation and its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries, including minimum capital ratios, supervisory ratings and, in the case of the depository institutions, at least satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act ratings. Failure to be an eligible financial holding company could result in the Federal Reserve limiting Bank of America's activities, including potential acquisitions.",
        "The scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased over the past several years, beginning with the response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. In addition, the banking and financial services sector is subject to substantial regulatory enforcement and fines. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Financial Reform Act). We cannot assess whether there will be any additional major changes in the regulatory environment and expect that our business will remain subject to continuing and extensive regulation and supervision.",
        "We are also subject to various other laws and regulations, as well as supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect our entities and management and our ability to make distributions to shareholders. For instance, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to both U.S. and international regulation, including supervision by the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and New York Stock Exchange, among others; our futures commission merchant subsidiaries supporting commodities and derivatives businesses in the U.S. are subject to regulation by and supervision of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), National Futures Association, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and in the case of the Banks, certain banking regulators; our insurance activities are subject to licensing and regulation by state insurance regulatory agencies; and our consumer financial products and services are regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).",

For instance, Federal Reserve regulations require major U.S. BHCs to submit a capital plan as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). ",
        "Our ability to pay dividends and make common stock repurchases depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers and non-capital standards established under the FDICIA. To the extent that the Federal Reserve increases our stress capital buffer (SCB), global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer, our returns of capital to shareholders could decrease. As part of its CCAR, the Federal Reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect our CCAR stress test results, which may impact the level of our SCB. Additionally, the Federal Reserve may impose limitations or prohibitions on taking capital actions such as paying or increasing common stock dividends or repurchasing common stock. For example, as a result of the economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic, the Federal Reserve required that during the second half of 2020, all large banks, including the Corporation, suspend share repurchase programs, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans, and limit common stock dividends to existing rates that did not exceed the average of the last four quarters' net income. In the first quarter of 2021, the Federal Reserve lifted the suspension of share repurchase programs and permitted large banks to pay common stock dividends and to repurchase shares in an amount that, when combined with dividends paid, does not exceed the average of net income over the last four quarters. ",
        "If the Federal Reserve finds that any of our Banks are not “well-capitalized” or “well-managed,” we would be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements, which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities. Additionally, the applicable federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine, under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or BHC, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof.",

        "Across international jurisdictions, resolution planning is the responsibility of national resolution authorities (RA). Among those, the jurisdictions of most impact to the Corporation are the requirements associated with subsidiaries in the U.K., Ireland and France, where rules have been issued requiring the submission of significant information about locally-incorporated subsidiaries (including information on intra-group dependencies, legal entity separation and barriers to resolution) as well as the Corporation’s banking branches located in those jurisdictions that are deemed to be material for resolution planning purposes. As a result of the RA's review of the submitted information, we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years that could increase operating costs and potentially result in the restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries.",

In addition, under the Financial Reform Act, when a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) such as the Corporation is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution. In the event of such appointment, the FDIC could, among other things, invoke the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the Treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations. The orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, but also adopts certain concepts from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",

The insolvency and resolution process could also lead to a large reduction or total elimination of the value of a BHC’s outstanding equity, as well as impairment or elimination of certain debt.",
        "Under the FDIC’s “single point of entry” strategy for resolving SIFIs, the FDIC could replace a distressed BHC with a bridge holding company, which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose equity is held solely for the benefit of creditors of the original BHC.",

Our culture’s key principles are: Safety First, Trust, Open Communications, Teamwork, Community Stewardship and Results.  ",

Our organization is also highly decentralized, with most day-to-day operating decisions made by our division general managers and their teams. With more than 26,000 teammates, only 150 work in our principal executive offices in Charlotte, North Carolina. By empowering our teammates, our goal is to foster an entrepreneurial mindset, along with a strong sense of personal responsibility and a culture of accountability. This empowerment is reinforced by our compensation policies, so as to drive results and contribute to our success. ",

Aside from our practice of everyday open communication, we periodically ask our teammates to formally provide feedback. Beginning in 1986, we have asked our teammates to complete a comprehensive survey in order to gather feedback on a range of topics, including matters relating to the effectiveness of our culture. We view the survey as an important tool we use to continually improve our company and ensure our teammates remain engaged and satisfied. This survey is conducted every three years, the last of which was conducted in 2019. In the most recent survey, 90% of the responses were favorable in the category of “Satisfaction & Commitment.” The overall percentage of negative responses in the most recent survey has dropped by 25 percentage points since the survey began in 1986. Teammates of certain previously acquired businesses – most notably DJJ and Harris, which together accounted for approximately 27% of our workforce as of December 31, 2020 – complete comparable surveys that have also shown an improving trend over time.",

We will continue working to eliminate exposures that can lead to injury and encourage our teammates to share their ideas for safety improvement.

Our operations are highly automated, allowing us to take advantage of lower employment costs while still providing our teammates with compensation that we believe is highly competitive as compared to comparable businesses in our industry. At Nucor, we believe in “Pay-for-Performance.”  Nucor teammates typically earn a significant part of their compensation based on their productivity. Production teammates work under group incentives that provide increased earnings for increased production. This additional incentive compensation is paid weekly in most cases. Nucor has also historically contributed 10% of earnings before federal taxes to a profit sharing plan for the majority of teammates below the officer level. We believe such compensation practices incentivize our workforce and reinforce our culture.",

The Southern Company system has a qualified defined benefit, trusteed pension plan and a qualified defined contribution, trusteed 401(k) plan which provides a competitive company matching contribution. Substantially all Southern Company system employees are eligible to participate in these plans. There are differences between the pension plan benefit formulas based on when and by which subsidiary an employee is hired. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.

Chevron’s leadership regularly reviews metrics on employee training and development programs, which are continually evolving to better meet the needs of the business. For instance, Chevron recently launched learning initiatives focused on digital innovation, including new Digital Academy and Digital Scholars programs. In addition, to ensure business continuity, leadership regularly reviews the talent pipeline, identifies and develops succession candidates, and builds succession plans for leadership positions. The Board provides oversight of CEO and executive succession planning. ",

Chevron reinforces the value of diversity and inclusion through accountability, communication, training and personnel selection processes. Examples of initiatives to further advance diversity and inclusion include the company’s Neurodiversity program through which the company employs neurodiverse individuals and leverages their talents, its Elevate program which focuses on learning opportunities to promote a deeper understanding of employees in underrepresented groups, and its Returnship initiative which provides support for women re-entering the workforce. In addition, Chevron has twelve employee networks (voluntary groups of employees that come together based on shared identity or interests) and more than fifteen diversity councils across its business units that help align diversity and inclusion efforts with business strategies.",

In 2020, the company’s employee survey focused on the COVID-19 impact on employee well-being and the company’s response to the pandemic. The survey results positively reinforced actions taken by Chevron, and helped inform further actions to address the impact on employees and their families through enhanced mental health and wellness support, financial assistance for unplanned childcare needs and remote learning resources, among other efforts. The company also has long-standing programs such as Ombuds, an independent resource designed to equip employees with options to address and resolve workplace issues; a company hotline, where employees can report concerns to the Corporate Compliance department; and its Employee Assistance Program, a confidential consulting service that can help employees resolve a broad range of personal, family and work-related concerns or problems.",

We believe our associates, customers, and communities mutually benefit by our focus on providing opportunities for our associates to make an impact at work and in our communities.  On a full-time equivalent basis at December 31, 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries employed 3,591 associates across the country. ",
        "Compensation and Benefits Program. The Company’s compensation program is designed to allow it to attract, reward, and retain talented individuals who contribute significant value to the organization.  UMB’s compensation programs reward performance, reserving the highest rewards for the highest performers.  The Company’s incentive plans are intended to promote the interests of UMB and its shareholders by providing associates with incentives and rewards to encourage them to continue in service of the Company.  The Company provides employees with compensation packages that include base salary, annual short-term incentive bonuses, and long-term equity awards tied to management, growth, and protection of the business of the Company.  In addition to cash and equity compensation, UMB offers a robust benefits program that includes medical, dental, and vision insurance, health savings accounts and a variety of insurance options, including pet, life and long-term care.  UMB also offers associates benefits including paid time off, paid volunteer time off, paid parental leave, adoption assistance, a 401(k) plan, as well as profit sharing and an employee stock ownership plan. Additionally, the Company strives to engage and encourage associates to act and take personal responsibility for improving the health and well-being for themselves and their families.  To assist associates with their goals, UMB offers wellness incentives and wellness coaches for strategic wellness support strategies.  ",

The Company believes that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions, results in better products and services, and is crucial to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. UMB’s talent acquisition team focuses on building recruitment marketing strategies that are designed to identify and attract diverse associates. In 2019, the Company launched a diverse panel approach specifically targeting senior-level roles where diversity is underrepresented and encourages hiring managers to engage a diverse panel of candidates before making hiring decisions. UMB business resource groups (BRGs) also play a vital role in deepening the recruitment pipeline of diverse talent and refer candidates to UMB on a regular basis.  BRGs are structured to engage associates who share common interests, including associates from traditionally underrepresented groups.  Nearly 20% of UMB associates participate in one or more BRGs.

Among the FRB’s policy tools are (1) open market operations (that is, purchases or sales of securities in the open market to adjust the supply of reserve balances in order to achieve targeted federal funds rates or to put pressure on longer-term interest rates in order to achieve more desirable levels of economic activity and job creation), (2) the discount rate charged on loans by the Federal Reserve Banks, (3) the level of reserves required to be held by depository institutions against specified deposit liabilities, (4) the interest paid or charged on balances maintained with the Federal Reserve Banks by depository institutions, including balances used to satisfy their reserve requirements, and (5) other deposit and loan facilities. ",
        "The FRB and its policies have a substantial impact on the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates and other aspects of pricing for loans and deposits, and the conditions in equity, fixed income, currency, and other markets in which the Company operates.  Policies announced or implemented by other central banks around the world have a meaningful effect as well and sometimes may be coordinated with those of the FRB.",
        "Tax and other fiscal policies, moreover, impact not only general economic conditions but also give rise to incentives or disincentives that affect how the Company and its customers prioritize objectives, operate businesses, and deploy resources.",

As a result, the Company—including all of its businesses and operations—is subject to the regulation, supervision, and examination of the FRB and to restrictions on permissible activities.

        "Many of the Company’s subsidiaries are also subject to separate or related forms of regulation, supervision, and examination, including: (1) the Bank, by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC) under the National Banking Acts, the FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDIA), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB) under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act); (2) UMBFS, UMB Distribution Services, LLC, UMB Financial Services, Inc., and Prairie Capital Management, LLC, by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and State regulatory authorities under federal and State securities laws, and UMB Distribution Services, LLC and UMB Financial Services, Inc., by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA); and (3) UMB Insurance, Inc., by State regulatory authorities under applicable State insurance laws. These regulatory schemes, like those overseen by the FRB, are designed to protect public or private interests that often are not aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders or non-deposit creditors.",
        "The FRB possesses extensive authorities and powers to regulate the conduct of the Company’s businesses and operations. If the FRB were to take the position that the Company or any of its subsidiaries have violated any law or commitment or engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice, formal or informal corrective or enforcement actions could be taken by the FRB against the Company, its subsidiaries, and institution-affiliated parties (such as directors, officers, and agents). These enforcement actions could include an imposition of civil monetary penalties and could directly affect not only the Company, its subsidiaries, and institution-affiliated parties but also the Company’s counterparties, shareholders, and creditors and its commitments, arrangements, or other dealings with them. The OCC has similarly expansive authorities and powers over the Bank and its subsidiaries, as does the CFPB over matters involving consumer financial laws. The SEC, FINRA, and other domestic or foreign government authorities also have an array of means at their disposal to regulate and enforce matters within their jurisdiction that could impact the Company’s businesses and operations.",
        "Restrictions on Permissible Activities and Corporate Matters",
        "Under the BHCA, bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and to closely related activities that are incidental to banking.",
        "As a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company under the GLBA, the Company is also able—directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries—to engage in activities that are financial in nature, that are incidental to a financial activity, or that are complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. Activities that are financial in nature include: (1) underwriting, dealing in, or making a market in securities, (2) providing financial, investment, or economic advisory services, (3) underwriting insurance, and (4) merchant banking.",
        "The Company’s ability to directly or indirectly engage in these banking and financial activities, however, is subject to conditions and other limits imposed by law or the FRB and, in some cases, requires the approval of the FRB or other government authorities. These conditions or other limits may arise due to the particular type of activity or, in other cases, may apply to the Company’s business more generally. Examples of the former are the substantial restrictions on the timing, amount, form, substance, interconnectedness, and management of the Company’s merchant banking investments. An example of the latter is a condition that, in order for the Company to engage in broader financial activities, its depository institutions must remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable banking laws and must receive at least a “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).  ",
        "Under amendments to the BHCA promulgated by the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 and the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company may acquire banks outside of its home State of Missouri, subject to specified limits and may establish new branches in other States to the same extent as banks chartered in those States. Under the BHCA, however, the Company must procure the prior approval of the FRB and possibly other government authorities to directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of five percent or more of any class of voting securities of, or substantially all of the assets of, an unaffiliated bank, savings association, or bank holding company. In deciding whether to approve any acquisition or branch, the FRB, the OCC, and other government authorities will consider public or private interests that may not be aligned with those of the Company’s ",

        "shareholders or non-deposit creditors. The FRB also has the power to require the Company to divest any depository institution that cannot maintain its “well capitalized” or “well managed” status.",
        "The FRB maintains a targeted policy that requires a bank holding company to inform and consult with the staff of the FRB sufficiently in advance of (1) declaring and paying a dividend that could raise safety and soundness concerns (for example, a dividend that exceeds earnings in the period for which the dividend is being paid), (2) redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses, or (3) redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction as of the end of the quarter in the amount of those equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred.",
        "Requirements Affecting the Relationships among the Company, Its Subsidiaries, and Other Affiliates",
        "The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank, UMBFS, and its other subsidiaries but receives the vast majority of its revenue in the form of dividends from those subsidiaries. Without the approval of the OCC, however, dividends payable by the Bank in any calendar year may not exceed the lesser of (1) the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years and (2) undivided profits. In addition, under the Basel III capital-adequacy standards described below under the heading “Capital-Adequacy Standards,” the Bank is currently required to maintain a capital conservation buffer in excess of its minimum risk-based capital ratios and will be restricted in declaring and paying dividends whenever the buffer is breached. The authorities and powers of the FRB, the OCC, and other government authorities to prevent any unsafe or unsound practice also could be employed to further limit the dividends that the Bank or the Company’s other subsidiaries may declare and pay to the Company.  ",
        "The Dodd-Frank Act requires a bank holding company like the Company to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository-institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries in circumstances when the Company might not otherwise elect to do so. The functional regulator of any nonbank subsidiary of the Company, however, may prevent that subsidiary from directly or indirectly contributing its financial support, and if that were to preclude the Company from serving as an adequate source of financial strength, the FRB may instead require the divestiture of depository-institution subsidiaries and impose operating restrictions pending such a divestiture. ",
        "A number of laws, principally Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (the FRA), and the FRB’s Regulation W, also exist to prevent the Company and its nonbank subsidiaries from taking improper advantage of the benefits afforded to the Bank as a depository institution, including its access to federal deposit insurance and the discount window. These laws generally require the Bank and its subsidiaries to deal with the Company and its nonbank subsidiaries only on market terms and, in addition, impose restrictions on the Bank and its subsidiaries in directly or indirectly extending credit to or engaging in other covered transactions with the Company or its nonbank subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the restrictions to derivatives and securities lending transactions and expanded the restrictions for transactions involving hedge funds or private-equity funds that are owned or sponsored by the Company or its nonbank subsidiaries.",
        "In addition, under the Volcker Rule, the Company is subject to extensive limits on proprietary trading and on owning or sponsoring hedge funds and private-equity funds. The limits on proprietary trading are largely directed toward purchases or sales of financial instruments by a banking entity as principal primarily for the purpose of short-term resale, a benefit from actual or expected short-term price movements, or the realization of short-term arbitrage profits. The limits on owning or sponsoring hedge funds and private-equity funds are designed to ensure that banking entities generally maintain only small positions in managed or advised funds and are not exposed to significant losses arising directly or indirectly from them. The Volcker Rule also provides for increased capital charges, quantitative limits, rigorous compliance programs, and other restrictions on permitted proprietary trading and fund activities, including a prohibition on transactions with a covered fund that would constitute a covered transaction under Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA.

        "The risk-based capital ratios are based on a banking organization’s risk-weighted asset amounts (RWAs), which are generally determined under the standardized approach applicable to the Company and the Bank by (1) assigning on-balance-sheet exposures to broad risk-weight categories according to the counterparty or, if relevant, the guarantor or collateral (with higher risk weights assigned to categories of exposures perceived as representing greater risk) and (2) multiplying off-balance-sheet exposures by specified credit conversion factors to calculate credit equivalent amounts and assigning those credit equivalent amounts to the relevant risk-weight categories.

        "These capital-to-assets ratios also play a central role in prompt corrective action (PCA), which is an enforcement framework used by the federal banking agencies to constrain the activities of banking organizations based on their levels of regulatory capital.  Five categories have been established using thresholds for the total risk-based capital ratio, the tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the common-equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and the leverage ratio: (1) well capitalized, (2) adequately capitalized, (3) undercapitalized, (4) significantly undercapitalized, and (5) critically undercapitalized.  While bank holding companies are not subject to the PCA framework, the FRB is empowered to compel a holding company to take measures—such as the execution of financial or performance guarantees—when prompt corrective action is required in connection with one of its depository-institution subsidiaries. At December 31, 2020, the Bank was categorized as well capitalized under the PCA framework.",

        "The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC in the standard insurance amount of $250 thousand per depositor for each account ownership category. This insurance is funded through assessments on the Bank and other insured depository institutions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, each institution’s assessment base is determined based on its average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity, and there is a scorecard method for calculating assessments that combines CAMELS (an acronym that refers to the five components of a bank’s condition that are addressed:  capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, and liquidity) ratings and specified forward-looking financial measures to determine each institution’s risk to the DIF.  The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the FDIC, in setting assessments, to offset the effect of increasing its reserve for the DIF on institutions with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. The result of this revised approach to deposit-insurance assessments is generally an increase in costs, on an absolute or relative basis, for institutions with consolidated assets of $10 billion or more.",

In addition, the administrative expenses of the conservator or receiver could be afforded priority over all or some of the claims of the institution’s creditors, and under the FDIA, the claims of depositors (including the FDIC as subrogee of depositors) would enjoy priority over the claims of the institution’s unsecured creditors.

The Compensation and Human Capital Committee of the Board has oversight of the company’s human capital management and its diversity and inclusion program and related policies and practices.

Half of 2020 at-risk deferred salary was subject to reduction based on corporate performance against the 2020 scorecard, as determined by FHFA, and half was subject to reduction based on individual performance in 2020, taking into account corporate performance against the 2020 Board of Directors’ goals, as determined by the Board of Directors with FHFA’s review. No amounts are shown in the “Threshold” column because deferred salary does not specify a minimum amount payable. The amounts shown in the “Maximum” column are the same as the amounts shown in the “Target” column because 2020 at-risk deferred salary was only subject to reduction; amounts higher than the target amount could not be awarded.

In addition, Bolt branch locations began to offer curbside pickup in the second quarter of 2020 and continue to do so.

Furthermore, Dominion Energy has been proactive in protecting its workforce during the global COVID-19 pandemic by establishing safety protocols, including requirements to wear face coverings and maintain physical distancing as well as new procedures for enhanced cleaning and temperature screening.

In October 2020, Dominion Energy announced its commitment to increase workforce diversity by 1% annually until it achieves at least 40% diverse representation. During 2020, Dominion Energy increased diverse representation within its workforce from 33.2% to 34.6%. For the purposes of measuring diversity, Dominion Energy includes non-minority female, minority male, minority female and undeclared female. In 2020 and 2019, the percentage of new hires that are diverse was 50% and 45%, respectively. Dominion Energy sponsors eight employee resource groups to support and reinforce its culture of inclusiveness by enabling employees with shared interests and backgrounds to work together to create community, provide networking opportunities and encourage professional development. The employee resource groups are aligned to support various forms of diversity and inclusion, including gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, race, veteran status, age, ability and cultural heritage. To further advance these initiatives, annual incentive plans for all employees, except as restricted by any collective bargaining agreements, include a performance measure for participation in diversity and inclusion training.",
