In addition, Dx's other commercial laboratory testing business that is not directly related to Medicare or Medicaid nevertheless depends significantly on continued participation in these programs and in other government healthcare programs, in part because customers often want a single laboratory to perform all of their testing services. In recent years, both governmental and private sector payers have made efforts to contain or reduce healthcare costs, including reducing reimbursement for clinical laboratory services.",
        "Reimbursement under the Medicare PFS is capped at different rates in each Medicare Administrative Contractor's jurisdiction.  Pursuant to PAMA, reimbursement under the CLFS is set at a national rate that is updated every three years for most tests. State Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients. Laboratories primarily bill and are reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid directly for covered tests performed on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries; for beneficiaries that participate in Managed Medicare and Managed Medicaid plans, laboratory bills are submitted to and paid by MCOs that manage those plans. Approximately 8.8% of Dx's revenue is reimbursed directly by Medicare under the CLFS.",
        "Many pathology services performed by Dx are reimbursed by Medicare under the PFS. The PFS assigns relative value units to each procedure or service, and a conversion factor is applied to calculate the reimbursement. The PFS is also subject to adjustment on an annual basis. Such adjustments can impact both the conversion factor and relative value units. The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR), the formula previously used to calculate the fee schedule conversion factor, would have resulted in significant decreases in payment for most physician services for each year since 2003. However, Congress intervened repeatedly to prevent these payment reductions, and the conversion factor was increased or frozen for the subsequent year. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) permanently replaced the SGR formula and transitioned PFS reimbursement to a value-based payment system. MACRA retroactively avoided a 21.2% reduction in PFS reimbursement that had been scheduled for April 1, 2015, and provided for PFS conversion factor increases of 0.5% from July 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and 0.5% in each of years 2016-2019, followed by no updates for 2020-2025, and updates that vary based on participation in alternative payment models in subsequent years. These changes to the conversion factor may be offset by reductions to the relative value units, as was the case with the 2016 PFS reductions. Approximately 0.4% of Dx's revenue is reimbursed under the PFS.",
        "In addition to changes in reimbursement rates, Dx is also impacted by changes in coverage policies for laboratory tests and annual CPT coding revisions. Medicare, Medicaid and private payer diagnosis code requirements and payment policies negatively impact Dx's ability to be paid for some of the tests it performs. Further, some payers require additional information to process claims, employ third-party utilization management tools, or have implemented prior authorization policies which delay or prohibit payment. In 2020, with the exception of those specifically related to COVID-19 testing, there were limited coding and billing changes. While limited changes are expected to be implemented in 2021, the Company typically expects some delays in pricing and reimbursement as new codes are introduced.",

        "Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations",
        "Existing U.S. laws governing federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as similar state laws, impose a variety of broadly described fraud and abuse prohibitions on healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories. These laws are interpreted liberally and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, OIG and various state agencies. Historically, the clinical laboratory industry has been the focus of major governmental enforcement initiatives. The U.S. government's enforcement efforts have been conducted under regulations such as HIPAA, which includes several provisions related to fraud and abuse enforcement, including the establishment of a program to coordinate and fund U.S., state and local law enforcement efforts, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which includes requirements directed at Medicaid fraud, including increased spending on enforcement and financial incentives for states to adopt false claims act provisions similar to the U.S. False Claims Act. Amendments to the False Claims Act, and other enhancements to the U.S. fraud and abuse laws enacted as part of the ACA, have further increased fraud and abuse enforcement efforts and compliance risks. For example, the ACA established an obligation to report and refund overpayments from Medicare or Medicaid within 60 days of identification (whether or not paid through any fault of the recipient); failure to comply with this requirement can give rise to additional liability under the False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties statute. ",
        "The U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits knowingly providing anything of value in return for, or to induce the referral of, Medicare, Medicaid or other U.S. healthcare program business. Violations can result in imprisonment, fines, penalties, and/or exclusion from participation in U.S. healthcare programs. The OIG has published “safe harbor” regulations that specify certain arrangements that are protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute if all conditions of the relevant safe harbor are met. Failure to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily constitute a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute; rather, the arrangement would be subject to scrutiny by regulators and prosecutors and would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Many states have their own Medicaid anti-kickback laws, and several states also have anti-kickback laws that apply to all payers (i.e., not just government healthcare programs).",
        "From time to time, the OIG issues alerts and other guidance on certain practices in the healthcare industry that implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other fraud and abuse laws. OIG Special Fraud Alerts and Advisory Opinions relevant to the Company set forth a number of practices allegedly engaged in by some clinical laboratories and healthcare providers that raise issues under the U.S. fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute. These practices include: (i) providing employees to furnish valuable services for physicians (other than collecting patient specimens for testing) that are typically the responsibility of the physicians’ staff; (ii) offering certain laboratory services at prices below fair market value in return for referrals of other tests that are billed to Medicare at higher rates; (iii) providing free testing to physicians’ managed care patients in situations where the referring physicians benefit from such reduced laboratory utilization; (iv) providing free pickup and disposal of biohazardous waste for physicians for items unrelated to a laboratory’s testing services; (v) providing general-use facsimile machines or computers to physicians that are not exclusively used in connection with the laboratory services; (vi) providing free testing for healthcare providers, their families and their employees (i.e., so-called “professional courtesy” testing); (vii) compensation paid by laboratories to physicians for blood specimen processing and for submitting patient data to registries; and (viii) the provision of discounts on laboratory services billed to customers in return for the referral of U.S. healthcare program business.",
        "In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, in October 2018, the U.S. enacted the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (EKRA), as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (SUPPORT Act). EKRA is an all-payer anti-kickback law that makes it a criminal offense to pay any remuneration to induce referrals to, or in exchange for, patients using the services of a recovery home, a substance use clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Although it appears that EKRA was intended to reach patient brokering and similar arrangements to induce patronage of substance use recovery and treatment, the language in EKRA is broadly written. As drafted, an EKRA prohibition on incentive compensation to sales employees is inconsistent with the federal anti-kickback statute and regulations, which permit payment of employee incentive compensation, a practice that is common in the industry. Significantly, EKRA permits the U.S.  Department of Justice to issue regulations clarifying EKRA’s exceptions or adding additional exceptions, but such regulations have not yet been issued. The Company is working through its trade association to address the scope of EKRA and is seeking clarification or correction.",

        "Under another U.S. statute, known as the Stark Law or “physician self-referral” prohibition, physicians who have a financial or a compensation relationship with a commercial laboratory may not, unless an exception applies, refer Medicare or Medicaid patients for testing to the laboratory, regardless of the intent of the parties. Similarly, laboratories may not bill Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited self-referral. There are several Stark Law exceptions that are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: i) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; ii) payments by physicians to a laboratory for commercial laboratory services; iii) ancillary services (including laboratory services) provided within the referring physician's own office, if certain criteria are satisfied; iv) physician investment in a company whose stock is traded on a public exchange and has stockholder equity exceeding $75.0 million; and v) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that are set at a fair market value rate and satisfy other requirements. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all patient referrals, not just government reimbursement programs.",
        "In December 2020, the OIG and CMS published final rules to amend the regulations implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law, respectively. The amendments are primarily intended to alleviate perceived impediments to coordinated care and value-based compensation arrangements through new safe harbors to the Anti-Kickback Statute and new exceptions to the Stark Law, and have varying degrees of applicability to laboratories. The CMS final rule incorporates laboratories and permits support for value-based arrangements, under certain conditions for purposes of the Stark Law. However, the OIG final rule excludes laboratories from protection under the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors for value-based arrangements. ",

Sanctions for violations of these laws may include exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other U.S. or state healthcare programs, significant criminal and civil fines and penalties, and loss of licensure. Any exclusion from participation in a U.S. healthcare program, or material loss of licensure, arising from any action by any federal or state regulatory or enforcement authority, would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

Information on AMCA's affected system from the Company may have included name, address, and balance information for the patient and person responsible for payment, along with the patient's phone number, date of birth, referring physician, and date of service. The Company was later informed by AMCA that health insurance information may have been included for some individuals, and because some insurance carriers utilize the Social Security Number as a subscriber identification number, the Social Security Number for some individuals may also have been affected. No ordered tests, laboratory test results, or diagnostic information from the Company were in the AMCA affected system. The Company notified individuals for whom it had a valid mailing address. For the individuals whose Social Security Number was affected, the notice included an offer to enroll in credit monitoring and identity protection services that will be provided free of charge for 24 months.

        "The Bank is a New York State-chartered commercial bank and its deposit accounts are insured under the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) up to applicable legal limits. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”), as its chartering agency, by the FDIC, as its insurer of deposits, and to a lesser extent by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which was created under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) in 2011 to implement and enforce consumer protection laws applying to banks. The Bank must file reports with the NYDFS, the FDIC, and the CFPB concerning its activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions. Furthermore, the Bank is periodically examined by the NYDFS and the FDIC to assess compliance with various regulatory requirements, including safety and soundness considerations. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a commercial bank can engage, and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with its supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss allowances for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the NYDFS, the FDIC, or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Company, the Bank and its operations, and the Company’s shareholders. While the regulatory environment has entered a period of rebalancing of the post financial crisis framework, we expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.",

On December 27, 2020, the CAA was signed into law, providing for, among other things, further suspension of the exception for loan modifications to not be classified as TDR if certain criteria are met, as described below. The CARES Act includes a provision for the Company to opt out of applying the TDR accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 310-40 for certain loan modifications. Loan modifications made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of i) December 31, 2020 or ii) 60 days after the President declares a termination of the COVID-19 national emergency are eligible for this relief if the related loans were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019.

Early in the second quarter of 2020, shelter-at-home mandates and other remediation from the COVID-19 pandemic were enacted. The pandemic and these remediation measures have directly impacted the communities we serve, where commercial activity decreased significantly. As of December 31, 2020, that commercial activity had improved but not returned to pre-pandemic levels. This continuing impact on commercial activity may have continuing adverse results, including on our customers’ ability to meet their obligations to us. ",
        "In addition, the economic pressures and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in changes in consumer spending behaviors in the communities we serve, which may negatively impact the demand for loans and other services we offer. However, the Company’s capital and financial resources have not been materially impacted by the pandemic, as our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which benefited from the actions taken by the Federal Reserve to counteract the negative economic impact of the pandemic. Future operating results and near-and-long-term financial condition are subject to significant uncertainty. Our funding sources have not changed significantly and we expect to continue to be able to timely service our debts and its obligations. ",
        "The Company has elected that loans temporarily modified for borrowers directly impacted by COVID-19 are not considered TDR, assuming that CARES Act criteria is met and as such, these loans are considered current and continue to accrue interest at its original contractual terms. The Company was quick to respond to the pandemic with new health and safety measures, including social distancing, appointment banking and expansion of our remote capabilities. Our staff responded to these changes in a superb fashion and continue to provide our customers with excellent service. Today our staff is returning to work with A and B schedules to maintain social distancing. On any given day, as many as 85% of staff have the capability to work from home.",

In addition to creating the CFPB, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the FRB to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository institutions; the components of Tier 1 capital will be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. In addition, the proceeds of trust preferred securities will be excluded from Tier 1 capital unless (i) such securities are issued by bank holding companies with assets of less than $500 million, or (ii) such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank or savings and loan holding companies with assets of less than $15 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new supervisory structure for oversight of the U.S. financial system, including the establishment of a new council of regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to monitor and address systemic risks to the financial system. Non-bank financial companies that are deemed to be significant to the stability of the U.S. financial system and all bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets will be subject to heightened supervision and regulation.

Title II of the Economic Growth Act provides regulatory relief to community banks, which are generally characterized in the statute as banking organizations with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and with limited trading activities. The Economic Growth Act required the federal banking agencies to develop a “community bank leverage ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. A financial institution can elect to be subject to this new definition. The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have issued a rule pursuant to the Economic Growth Act to establish for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion a “community bank leverage ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) of 8% that such institutions may elect to use in lieu of the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under Basel III.

Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to hold additional capital. The agencies have issued a joint policy statement providing guidance on interest rate risk management, including a discussion of the critical factors affecting the agencies’ evaluation of interest rate risk in connection with capital adequacy.

The federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness (the “Guidelines”) to implement these safety and soundness standards. The Guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the Guidelines, the agency may require the institution to provide it with an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard, as required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, (the “FDI Act”).

The standards also must be consistent with accompanying FDIC guidelines, which include loan-to-value limitations for the different types of real estate loans. Institutions are also permitted to make a limited amount of loans that do not conform to the proposed loan-to-value limitations so long as such exceptions are reviewed and justified appropriately.

        "Growth in the Semiconductor Equipment market is driven by growing integrated circuits content across many industries, increased demand for processing and storage in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence or autonomous vehicles, the rapid adoption of advanced mobile connectivity solutions such as 5G and enhancing existing and enabling new wireless applications. To address the long-term growing demand for semiconductor devices, the industry continues to invest in production capacities for advanced logic devices at the 7nm technology node and beyond, the latest memory devices including 3D-NAND, DRAM, and new emerging memories such as MRAM, and back-end test and advanced wafer-level packaging. The industry’s transition to advanced technology nodes in logic and DRAM and to increased layers in 3D memory devices is requiring an increased number of etch and deposition process tools and higher content of our advanced power solutions per tool. As etching and deposition processes become more challenging due to increasing aspect ratios in advanced 3D devices, more advanced radio frequency (\"RF\") and direct current (\"DC\") technologies are needed. We are meeting these challenges by providing a broader range of more complex RF and DC power solutions. Beyond etch and deposition processes, the growing complexity at the advanced nodes also drive a higher number of other processes across the fab, including inspection, metrology, thermal, ion implantation, and semiconductor test, where Advanced Energy is actively participating as a critical technology provider. In addition, our global support services group offers comprehensive local repair service, upgrade and retrofit offerings to extend the useable life of our customers’ capital equipment for additional technology generations. The acquisition of Artesyn in September 2019 expanded Advanced Energy’s reach within the Semiconductor Equipment market by adding a broad range of low voltage applications as well as back-end test and assembly equipment makers.",

In late 2019 and through 2020, demand for our embedded power products in the data center computing market increased significantly driven by share gains and a capacity ramp at hyperscale customers. In addition, we believe as a consequence of COVID-19, hyperscale demand has risen in the near term given the increased need for cloud and network applications in the current environment.

Revenue in 2020 benefited from $670.8 million in inorganic sales from the acquisition of Artesyn. Organic sales in 2020 increased $176.4 million primarily due to increased demand in the Semiconductor Equipment market offset by lower sales of our industrial thin film products due to a weaker overall macroeconomic environment and the impact of COVID-19. Sales in 2019 include $220.3 million in sales from our acquisition of Artesyn.",
        "In 2020, sales to the Semiconductor Equipment market increased $208.8 million, or 51.8% to $611.9 million from $403.0 million in 2019. The increase in sales during 2020 is primarily due to an overall increase in demand for semiconductor equipment used in deposition and etch applications, increasing power content in semiconductor manufacturing tools, and market share gains in RF match and remote plasma sources.",

Our customers in this market are primarily global and regional original equipment and device manufacturers. Inorganic growth contributed $97.9 million in 2020, while organic sales in the Industrial and Medical market decreased $30.3 million, or 17.9%. The increase in inorganic sales is primarily due to inclusion of full year results for Artesyn in 2020 compared to a partial year during 2019. The decrease in organic sales was primarily due to slowing macroeconomic conditions, the impact of COVID-19 on global manufacturing, and lower demand in the consumer hard coating and flat panel display markets impacting our thin film deposition markets, partially offset by growth in medical and other embedded power products.",
        "Sales in the Data Center Computing market were $322.5 million in 2020 and $91.4 million in 2019. The increase in Data Center Computing market sales is primarily due to inclusion of full year results for Artesyn in 2020 compared to a partial year during 2019 and revenue increases driven by growth in hyperscale customers and market share gains. ",
        "Sales in the Telecom and Networking market were $167.8 million in 2020 and $48.5 million in 2019. The increase in telecom and networking sales is due to the addition of new product verticals through inorganic growth. Since early 2019, demand for telecom and networking equipment has been impacted by reduced investment in current generation networks given geopolitical issues, consolidation of network providers, and slowing global growth. Demand in the Telecom and Networking market started to recover in the second half of 2020, and over time 5G infrastructure investments and upgrades to enterprise networks are expected to drive growth in this market.",

The decrease in gross profit as a percent of revenue is largely related to the mix of embedded power products acquired from Artesyn, which carry a lower gross margin, offset partially by the impact of increased volume from our organic product mix, improvements in material cost, and synergies from the combined company. Gross profit in 2020 includes $160.8 million from our acquisitions of Artesyn. Gross profit in 2019 includes $44.8 million associated with our acquisition of Artesyn.",

SG&A expenses include $57.0 million from our acquisition of Artesyn. SG&A expenses in 2019 include $19.3 million from our acquisition of Artesyn. Organic SG&A expenses increased by $8.3 million primarily due to increased incentive and stock-based compensation, offset partially by decrease in reserve for credit losses related to prior year credit exposure in the PRC as a result of deferred programs due in part to COVID-19, and lower headcount, professional services, and synergies related to the Artesyn integration.",

In May 2019 we sold our central solar inverter repair and service operation and recorded a one-time gain of $14.8 million. Other income (expense) excluding the effect of the sale of the central inverter service and repair business was ($2.0) million in 2019. The increase in other income (expense) is primarily due to foreign exchange losses as our exposure to foreign currencies increased with the Artesyn acquisition and higher interest expense related to a full year of interest in 2020 compared to approximately four months interest in the second half of 2019 related to the debt issued in connection with the acquisition of Artesyn.",

Income tax expense in 2019 was $10.7 million or an effective tax rate of 15.9%. The 2020 effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates, offset by net U.S. tax on foreign operations and withholding taxes.",

Deferred revenue for extended inverter warranties and the associated costs of warranty service will be reflected in Sales and Cost of goods sold, respectively, from continuing operations in future periods in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as the deferred revenue is earned, and the associated services are rendered. Extended warranties related to the inverter product line are no longer offered.",
        "In May 2019, we divested our grid-tied central solar inverter repair and service operation. In conjunction with the divesture, the initial product warranty for the previously sold grid-tied central solar inverters was transferred to the buyer. Accordingly, a gain of $8.6 million net of tax expense of $2.4 million was recognized in Other income (expense), net and Provision (benefit) for income taxes, respectively, in our discontinued operations for the year December 31, 2019. Operating income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, also includes the impacts of changes in our estimated product warranty liability, the recovery of accounts receivable and foreign exchange gain or (losses).",

We generally place our investments with high-credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk.",
        "As of December 31, 2020, our investments consisted primarily of certificates of deposit with maturity of less than one year. As a measurement of the sensitivity of our portfolio and if our investment portfolio balances remain constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points (1%) in interest rates would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by a nominal amount.",

Our quarterly commitments of interest payments are impacted by an increase or decrease of interest rate fluctuations. ",
        "In April 2020, the Company executed interest rate swap contracts with independent financial institutions to partially reduce the variability of cash flows in LIBOR indexed debt interest payments on our Term Loan Facility (under the Company’s existing Credit Agreement dated as of September 10, 2019). These transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedging instruments.",
        "The interest rate swap contracts fixed 85% of the outstanding principal balance on our term loan to a total interest rate of 1.271%. This is comprised of 0.521% average fixed rate per annum in exchange for a variable interest rate based on one-month USD-LIBOR-BBA plus the credit spread in the Company’s existing Credit Agreement, which is 75 basis points at current leverage ratios.",
        "If our $323.8 million in borrowings had been outstanding for the full year ended December 31, 2020, a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points (1%) in interest rates would increase our commitments by $3.2 million. ",

Our purchasing and sales activities are primarily denominated in the USD, JPY, EUR, and CNY. We may be impacted by changes in the relative buying power of our customers, which may impact sales volumes either positively or negatively. As these currencies fluctuate against each other, and other currencies, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on sales, purchasing transactions and labor.",

Market risk arises from the potential adverse effects on the value of derivative instruments that result from a change in foreign currency exchange rates. We may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the exchange rate risk associated with intercompany debt denominated in nonfunctional currencies. We minimize our market risk applicable to foreign currency exchange rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of our derivative contract instruments. We enter into derivative contract instruments for risk management purposes only. We do not enter into or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.",

Assets and liabilities of substantially all of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are translated at period end rates of exchange for each reporting period. Operating results and cash flow statements are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange during each reporting period. Although these translation changes have no immediate cash impact, the translation changes may impact future borrowing capacity, and overall value of our net assets.",

Our foreign operations primarily sell product and incur expenses in the related local currency. Exchange rate fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers, which could result in lower net sales by us to such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.

We also evaluated the Company’s significant assumptions and the completeness and accuracy of the data used to determine the amount of the foreign tax credits and GILTI, including foreign earnings and profits, and tested the accuracy of such calculations. As part of these procedures, we engaged tax subject matter professionals with knowledge of and experience with international and local income tax laws to evaluate the application of these regulations to the Company’s tax positions.

Our contribution rates could increase if the Trust is required to adopt a funding improvement plan or a rehabilitation plan as a result of funding deficiencies in excess of specified levels, which may be due to poor performance of Trust investments or other factors, or as a result of future wage and benefit agreements. In addition, if we choose to stop participating in the Trust, our contributions to the Trust decline or the Trust is terminated, we may be required to pay the Trust an amount based on the underfunded status of the Trust, referred to as a withdrawal liability.

As part of this process, we use a variety of analytical methods that consider experience, trends and other relevant factors. IBNR reserves are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have been reported or expected to be reported in the future and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses. Reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves. Within the loss reserving process, standard actuarial methods which include: (1) loss development factor methods; (2) expected loss methods (Bornheutter-Ferguson); and (3) adjusted loss methods (Berquist-Sherman), are given due consideration. These methods are described below:",

",

The expected ultimate losses are based upon current estimates of ultimate losses from prior accident years, adjusted to reflect expected earned premium, current rating, claims cost levels and changes in business mix. The expected losses, and corresponding loss ratios, are a critical component of Bornheutter-Ferguson methodologies and provide a general reasonability guide.",

        "Berquist-Sherman methods are used for estimating reserves in business lines where historical development patterns may be deemed less reliable for more recent accident years’ ultimate losses. Under these methods, patterns of historical paid or reported losses are first adjusted to reflect current payment settlement patterns and case reserve adequacy and then evaluated in the same manner as the loss development factor methods described above. When the adequacy of case reserves change, the Berquist-Sherman incurred method may be deemed more reliable than the reported loss development factor method. Likewise, when the settlement patterns change, the Berquist-Sherman paid method may be deemed more reliable than the paid loss development factor method.",

        "The Company reviews fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and assesses whether it intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the debt security meets either of these two criteria, an intend-to-sell impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the impairment measurement date. If neither of the above criteria are met, the credit loss portion of the unrealized loss is recorded through earnings and the non-credit portion remains in other comprehensive income. Credit losses are estimated by comparing the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security with the net present value of the security’s projected future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the investment prior to impairment. The non-credit portion of the impairment is equal to the difference between the fair value and the net present value of the security’s cash flows at the impairment measurement date. Until January 1, 2020, intend-to-sell impairments and credit losses on fixed maturities resulted in a reduction of the amortized cost basis of the security, and reversal of an impairment was not allowed.  Beginning January 1, 2020, credit losses are recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than an adjustment to amortized cost. Recoveries of impairments on fixed maturities are recognized as reversals of the allowance for credit loss and are no longer accreted as investment income through an adjustment to investment yield. The allowance for credit losses is limited to the amount that fair value is less than amortized cost and therefore, increases in the fair value of investments due to reasons other than credit could result in decreases in the allowance and an increase in net income.

        "The Company reviews fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and assesses whether it intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the debt security meets either of these two criteria, an intend-to-sell impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the impairment measurement date. If neither of the above criteria are met, the credit loss portion of the unrealized loss is recorded through earnings and the non-credit portion remains in other comprehensive income. Credit losses are estimated by comparing the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security with the net present value of the security’s projected future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the investment prior to impairment. The non-credit portion of the impairment is equal to the difference between the fair value and the net present value of the security’s cash flows at the impairment measurement date. Until January 1, 2020, intend-to-sell impairments and credit losses on fixed maturities resulted in a reduction of the amortized cost basis of the security, and reversal of an impairment was not allowed.  Beginning January 1, 2020, credit losses are recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than an adjustment to amortized cost. Recoveries of impairments on fixed maturities are recognized as reversals of the allowance for credit loss and are no longer accreted as investment income through an adjustment to investment yield. The allowance for credit losses is limited to the amount that fair value is less than amortized cost and therefore, increases in the fair value of investments due to reasons other than credit could result in decreases in the allowance and an increase in net income.

        "The Company reviews fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and assesses whether it intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the debt security meets either of these two criteria, an intend-to-sell impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the impairment measurement date. If neither of the above criteria are met, the credit loss portion of the unrealized loss is recorded through earnings and the non-credit portion remains in other comprehensive income. Credit losses are estimated by comparing the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security with the net present value of the security’s projected future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the investment prior to impairment. The non-credit portion of the impairment is equal to the difference between the fair value and the net present value of the security’s cash flows at the impairment measurement date. Until January 1, 2020, intend-to-sell impairments and credit losses on fixed maturities resulted in a reduction of the amortized cost basis of the security, and reversal of an impairment was not allowed.  Beginning January 1, 2020, credit losses are recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than an adjustment to amortized cost. Recoveries of impairments on fixed maturities are recognized as reversals of the allowance for credit loss and are no longer accreted as investment income through an adjustment to investment yield. The allowance for credit losses is limited to the amount that fair value is less than amortized cost and therefore, increases in the fair value of investments due to reasons other than credit could result in decreases in the allowance and an increase in net income.

For detail on our investments, see the Investable Assets Held by Arch section of “Financial Condition” in Item 7 and note 9, “Investment Information,” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. RATINGSOur ability to underwrite business is affected by the quality of our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent agencies. Such ratings from third party internationally recognized statistical rating organizations or agencies are instrumental in establishing the financial security of companies in our industry. We believe that the primary users of such ratings include commercial and investment banks, policyholders, brokers, ceding companies and investors. Insurance ratings are also used by insurance and reinsurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of insurers and reinsurers, and are often an important factor in the decision by an insured or intermediary of whether to place business with a particular insurance or reinsurance provider. The financial strength ratings of our operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic review as rating agencies evaluate us to confirm that we continue to meet their criteria for ratings they have assigned to us. Such ratings may be revised or revoked at the discretion of such ratings agencies in response to a variety of factors, including capital adequacy, management, earnings, forms of capitalization and risk profile. A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) are ratings agencies which have assigned financial strength and/or issuer ratings to Arch Capital and/or one or more of its subsidiaries. The ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies.

At Vlissingen, we have completed a variety of expansion projects and efficiency programs in order to more than double the plant's production capacity.

        "With the emergence of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we took precautions to reduce the risk of virus exposure for all employees. We encouraged all of our employees who were able to work from home to do so and reduced the number of people in our offices significantly with the remote work option. Because of our business, it was necessary for essential employees to remain onsite. For those employees and any other employees who entered our offices, we adopted new safety protocols including, social distancing, face mask requirements, temperature screening and health questionnaires. ",
        "In March 2020, we recognized the severity of COVID-19 and offered a special enrollment period to our employees to provide them with an additional opportunity to participate in our health insurance plan.

Competition  The analytical instrument systems, supplies and services market is highly competitive. The Company encounters competition from several worldwide suppliers and other companies in both domestic and foreign markets for each of its three primary technologies. The Company competes in its markets primarily on the basis of product performance, reliability, service and, to a lesser extent, price. Competitors continuously introduce new products and have instrument businesses that are generally more diversified than the Company’s business. Some competitors have greater financial resources and broader distribution than the Company’s.  In the markets served by Waters, the Company’s principal competitors include: Agilent Technologies, Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, Bruker Corporation, Danaher Corporation and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. In the markets served by TA, the Company’s principal competitors include: PerkinElmer, Inc., Mettler-Toledo International Inc., NETZSCH-Geraetebau GmbH, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Malvern PANalytical Ltd., a subsidiary of Spectris plc, and Anton-Paar GmbH.  The market for consumable LC products, including separation columns, is highly competitive and generally more fragmented than the analytical instruments market. The Company encounters competition in the consumable columns market from chemical companies that produce column sorbents and small specialized companies that primarily pack purchased sorbents into columns and subsequently package and distribute columns. The Company believes that it is one of the few suppliers that processes silica and polymeric resins, packs columns and distributes its own products. The Company competes in this market on the basis of performance, reproducibility, reputation and, to a lesser extent, price. In recent years, the Company’s principal competitors for consumable products have included: Danaher Corporation; Merck KGaA; Agilent Technologies, Inc.; General Electric Company and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. The ACQUITY UPLC instrument is designed to offer a predictable level of performance when used with ACQUITY UPLC columns and the Company believes that the expansion of the ACQUITY UPLC instrument base will enhance its chromatographic column business because of the high level of synergy between ACQUITY UPLC columns and the ACQUITY UPLC instruments.  Patents, Trademarks and Licenses  The Company owns a number of United States and foreign patents and has patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. Certain technology and software has been acquired or is licensed from third parties. The Company also owns a number of trademarks. The Company’s patents, trademarks and licenses are viewed as valuable assets to its operations.

As a result, competition for these individuals is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We face substantial competition among numerous biopharmaceutical companies and academic institutions for individuals with these skills. ",

        "Hiring Practices It is our policy to hire and promote the best-qualified person for the job and comply fully with all domestic, foreign and local laws relating to discrimination in the workplace. Our good faith outreach efforts are designed to ensure that there are no barriers for members of any group and to encourage interest by all qualified persons. We believe our actions enhance diversity, including recruiting at venues representing women, minorities and U.S. military veterans. Turnover We continually monitor employee turnover rates, both regionally and as a whole, as our success depends upon retaining our highly trained engineering, manufacturing and operating personnel. The average tenure of our employees is 9.8 years in the United States and 9.5 years in Asia. Diversity and Inclusion Recognizing and respecting our global presence, we strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce everywhere we operate. We believe that a diverse and motivated workforce is vital to our success. We strive to advance diversity and inclusion through various talent acquisition programs to attract, retain and develop a diverse, highly-skilled work force. We conduct employee surveys to provide on-going feedback on how we are doing against our commitment to treat all employees fairly and provide equal opportunity in an environment free of discrimination. Our diversity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training, in particular by educating employees about our policies against harassment and bullying and about the elimination of bias in the workplace. Management Team We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our chief executive officer and business unit leaders average approximately 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented professional team. Training and Talent Development We are committed to the continued development of our employees. Strategic talent reviews and succession planning occur on a planned cadence annually – globally and across all business areas. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next generation leaders. We have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established specialized programs to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles in management, engineering, and operations. We also provide technical, professional and leadership training to our employees. We recognize and support the growth and development of our employees and offer opportunities to participate in internal as well as external learning opportunities. Compensation and Benefits We strive to offer employees regionally competitive compensation and benefits that are aligned to our values. All employees receive a base salary, incentive compensation and welfare benefits. Depending on the region, benefits include medical, dental and vision coverage, short and long-term disability income protection, flexible spending plans (health, dependent and limited flexible spending) and basic and supplemental life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and retirement savings plan. Intevac pays the majority or all of the costs for these benefits. We have various employee incentive plans. Our profit-sharing plan provides for the distribution of a percentage of pre-tax profits to substantially all of our employees not eligible for other performance-based incentive plans. Our executives and key contributors participate in bonus plans based on the achievement of profitability and other individual performance goals and objectives. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with our stockholders we grant equity-based awards, including restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) to eligible employees. We also have an employee stock purchase plan, which provides employees with the opportunity to purchase Intevac common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of these plans.  12 ",

Additionally, each year management and the Human Resources Committee of Ameren’s board of directors review the diversity of our workforce, leadership team, and leadership development pipeline, as well as the actions taken to further enhance the diversity of our leadership team. In addition, the Ameren Companies contribute to community-based organizations, hold diversity, equity, and inclusion leadership summits for employees and community leaders, and offer various training programs. Beginning in 2021, we implemented a program to provide paid-time off for employees who engage in volunteer or learning opportunities with organizations that support diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Effective January 31, 2018, the Bank converted to a national bank charter and the Company became a bank holding company (“BHC”) under Section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”) and is subject to the requirements of the BHC Act, including required approvals for investments in or acquisitions of banking organizations, or entities involved in activities that are deemed closely related to banking, capital adequacy standards and limitations on nonbanking activities. The Company is registered with the FRB and is required by Federal law to file reports with, and comply with the rules and regulations of the FRB. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System and, with respect to deposit insurance, of the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) managed by the FDIC. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, as its primary Federal regulator, and the FDIC, as the deposit insurer. The Bank must file reports with the OCC and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to consummating certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other insured depository institutions. The OCC conducts periodic examinations to test the Bank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors and to ensure the safe and sound operation of the Bank. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.

The CFPB has enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer laws by their primary bank regulator. The Bank is currently examined by the OCC for compliance with consumer protection laws. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s total assets were $11.45 billion and is therefore subject to authority enforcement by the CFPB, subject to a phase in period. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the Federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and Federal savings associations, and gives state attorney generals the ability to enforce Federal consumer protection laws. ",
        "Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act includes a series of provisions covering mortgage loan origination standards affecting, among other things, originator compensation, minimum repayment standards and prepayments. The Dodd-Frank Act requires originators to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on documented information that a borrower has a reasonable ability to repay a particular mortgage loan over the long term. If the originator cannot meet this standard, the burden is on the lender to demonstrate the appropriateness of its policies and the strength of its controls. The Dodd-Frank Act contains an exception from this Ability-To-Repay rule for “Qualified Mortgages.” The rule sets forth specific underwriting criteria for a loan to qualify as a Qualified Mortgage. The criteria generally exclude loans that (1) are interest-only, (2) have excessive upfront points or fees, or (3) have negative amortization features, balloon payments, or terms in excess of 30 years. To be defined as an Ability-To-Repay Qualified Mortgage, the underwriting criteria also impose a maximum debt to income ratio of 43%, based upon documented and verifiable information. If a loan meets these criteria and is not a “higher priced loan” as defined in FRB regulations, the CFPB rule establishes a safe harbor preventing a consumer from asserting the failure of the originator to establish the consumer’s Ability-To-Repay.

The FRB also issued an interim final rule that allows a fraud-prevention adjustment of one cent ($0.01) per transaction conditioned upon an issuer adopting effective fraud prevention policies and procedures. The Bank’s average interchange fee per transaction is forty one cents ($0.41). At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s total assets were $11.45 billion and will therefore be subject to reduced interchange fees beginning in July 2021 of approximately $2.5 million for 2021, or $5.0 million annualized. In addition, market forces may result in reduced fees charged by all issuers, regardless of asset size, which may result in reduced revenues for the Bank. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank’s revenues from interchange fees was $10.9 million, an increase of $1.4 million from 2019. The Bank is currently seeking transition relief from this rule and, if approved, the Bank may be exempt until 2022.",

In addition, initial margin requirements for non-centrally cleared swaps and security-based swaps may be effective for the Bank’s swap counterparties that are swap dealers on September 1, 2021, at which time such counterparties will be required to collect initial margin from the Bank. The initial margin requirements were issued for the purpose of ensuring safety and soundness of swap trading in light of the risk to the financial system associated with non-cleared swaps activity. The Bank is prepared to meet compliance with the initial margin requirements.

The legislation also directs the Federal banking agencies to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded.

Among other things, the EGRRCPA increased the asset threshold for depository institutions and holding companies to perform stress tests required under Dodd Frank from $10 billion to $250 billion, exempted institutions with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets from the “Volker Rule,” and raised the threshold for the requirement that publicly traded holding companies have a risk committee from $10 billion in consolidated assets to $50 billion in consolidated assets.

Culture refers to employee engagement, adherence to established requirements, a sense of urgency for safety, and leadership.  Focus areas in the Utility’s workplace safety strategy include: an enterprise safety management system, enhanced risk management, contractor management, improvement of safety technical standards, musculoskeletal disorder programs and ergonomics, safety audits, data management, systems and reporting, and safety culture.  The Utility uses a variety of metrics to track workforce safety performance, including the number of injuries that result in days away, restricted or transferred duty per 200,000 hours worked (“DART”).  In 2020, the Utility’s DART was 1.34, which was 35% lower than in 2019 and its lowest rate in the past five years.",
        "In addition to employee safety, a key area of the Utility’s workforce safety strategy includes strengthening contractor safety.  The Utility’s Contractor Safety Program requires contractors performing medium- and high-risk work to meet prequalification requirements to perform work for or on behalf of the Utility.  The Utility’s contractors and subcontractors include approximately 26,000 individuals from approximately 2,200 contractor companies.  For employees and contractors performing medium- and high-risk work, the Utility’s safety metrics include the number of workforce serious injuries and fatalities (“SIF-A”) and events that could have resulted in a SIF-A per 200,000 hours worked (the “SIF-P rate”).  In 2020, the Utility had 10 SIF-A events, which resulted in five fatalities and seven injuries, and a SIF-P rate of 0.10, which was 29% lower than in 2019.  The Utility began including contractors in its SIF-P rate in June 2020.  ",

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also remained focused on protecting the health and safety of their employees, contractors and the Utility’s customers, while continuing to perform critical utility work, and have continued to monitor and track the impact of the pandemic, modifying or adopting new policies in support of their employees’ health and safety as pandemic conditions and governmental response have changed.  For example, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have directed employees to work remotely from home where possible, implemented new face coverings and physical distancing policies, required virtual ergonomic evaluations to ensure that employees now working from home so do safely and ergonomically, provided additional COVID-19 safety resources for employees who perform utility work in the field, and updated several of their employee benefits as a result of COVID-19, including healthcare benefits, and interim time off and leave policies that support the care and new educational environment of children during the pandemic.",

        "Knoll’s health and safety programs are designed using the ISO 45001 global standards to address associate engagement, risk reduction, and measurable continuous improvement. Our programs strive to comply with all federal, state, provincial and local safety regulations, codes and standards. Knoll requires each of its locations to perform regular safety compliance audits to ensure proper safety policies, program procedures, industrial hygiene and training are in place. In addition, Knoll utilizes leading indicators to assess the health and safety performance of its operations, including near miss reporting, risk reduction, and behavior-based safety observations. Knoll recognizes that improvement of these leading indicators has led to a drastic reduction in workplace injury and severity. Lagging indicators include the OSHA Total Recordable Case Incident Rate (\"TCIR\") and the Day Away Case Rate (\"DACR\") based upon the number of incidents per 100 employees (or per 200,000 work hours). In 2020, Knoll Office had a TCIR of 0.65, a DACR of 0.05; a decrease of 26% and 83% from 2019, respectively. Our East Greenville, PA site is recognized by the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration’s Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) for its low injury rates, employee engagement and training programs. We are proud of this recognition, as out of approximately 8 million workplaces in the U.S., only approximately 1,300 have earned VPP Star recognition.",

Under these laws, the respective state insurance departments may examine us at any time, require disclosure of material transactions and require prior notice of or approval for certain transactions. All transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation.",
        "Change of Control",
        "The insurance holding company laws of nearly all states require advance approval by the respective state insurance departments of any change of control of an insurer. “Control” is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. In addition, insurance laws in many states contain provisions that require pre-notification to the insurance commissioners of a change of control of a non-domestic insurance company licensed in those states. Any future transactions that would constitute a change of control of AIIC, SOCI or AIICTX, including a change of control of AMERISAFE, would generally require the party acquiring control to obtain the prior approval of the department of insurance in the state in which the insurance company being acquired is incorporated and may require pre-notification in the states where pre-notification provisions have been adopted. Obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of, or deter, any such transaction.",

AIICTX is primarily subject to regulation and supervision by the Texas Department of Insurance and Workers’ Compensation Commission. These state agencies have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers, including the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business, license agencies, set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained, determine the nature of, and limitations on, investments and dividends, approve policy forms and rates in some states, periodically examine financial statements, determine the form and content of required financial statements and periodically examine market conduct.",

Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets.",

        "In most of the states where we are licensed to transact business, there is a requirement that property and casualty insurers doing business in that state participate in a guaranty association, which is organized to pay contractual benefits owed under insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premium written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets.",

At this time, we are unable to determine the impact, if any, such assessments may have on our financial position or results of operations. We have established liabilities for potential state guaranty fund assessments with respect to insurers becoming insolvent.",
        "Residual Market Programs",
        "Many of the states in which we conduct business or intend to conduct business require that all licensed insurers participate in a program to provide workers’ compensation insurance to those employers who have not or cannot obtain coverage from a carrier on a negotiated basis. The level of required participation in such programs is generally determined by calculating the volume of our voluntary business in that state as a percentage of all voluntary business in that state by all insurers. The resulting factor is the proportion of premium we must accept as a percentage of all of premiums in policies included in that state’s residual market program.",
        " ",
        "Companies generally can fulfill their residual market obligations by either issuing insurance policies to employers assigned to them, or participating in a reinsurance pool where the results of all policies provided through the pool are shared by the participating companies. We utilize both methods, depending on management’s evaluation of the most cost-efficient method to adopt in each state that allows a choice of assigned risk or participation in a pooling arrangement.

Our recoveries from state-managed trust funds for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $4.5 million, $4.8 million and $4.8 million, respectively.

The USL&H Act requires employers to provide medical benefits, compensation for lost wages, and rehabilitation services to longshoremen, harbor workers and other maritime workers who may suffer injury, disability or death during the course and scope of their employment. The Department of Labor has the authority to require us to make deposits to serve as collateral for losses incurred under the USL&H Act.",

Subsequently, a majority of states have implemented additional regulations to address privacy issues. These laws and regulations apply to all financial institutions, including insurance companies, and require us to maintain appropriate policies and procedures for managing and protecting certain personal information of our policyholders and to fully disclose our privacy practices to our policyholders. We may also be exposed to future privacy laws and regulations, which could impose additional costs and impact our results of operations or financial condition. In 2000, the NAIC adopted the Privacy of Consumer Financial and Health Information Model Regulation, which assisted states in promulgating regulations to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. In 2002, to further facilitate the implementation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the NAIC adopted the Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information Model Regulation. Several states have now adopted similar provisions regarding the safeguarding of policyholder information. We have established policies and procedures intended to ensure that we are in compliance with the privacy requirement of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.",

This includes maintaining an information security program based on ongoing risk assessment, overseeing third-party service providers, investigating data breaches and notifying regulators of a cybersecurity event. Some states have adopted similar versions of the Insurance Data Security Model Law.

Among the proposals that have in the past been, or are at present, being considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state regulation of insurers and proposals in various state legislatures (some of which proposals have been enacted) to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the NAIC.

Although the NAIC has no legislative authority and insurance companies are at all times subject to the laws of their respective domiciliary states and, to a lesser extent, other states in which they conduct business, the NAIC is influential in determining the form in which such laws are enacted. Model insurance laws, regulations and guidelines, which we refer to as the Model Laws, have been promulgated by the NAIC as a minimum standard by which state regulatory systems and regulations are measured. Adoption of state laws that provide for substantially similar regulations to those described in the Model Laws is a requirement for accreditation by the NAIC. The NAIC provides authoritative guidance to insurance regulators on statutory accounting issues by promulgating and updating a codified set of statutory accounting practices in its Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual. The Nebraska and Texas legislatures have adopted these codified statutory accounting practices.",

        "Under Nebraska law, AIIC and SOCI are each required to maintain minimum capital and surplus of $2.0 million. Under Texas law, AIICTX is required to maintain minimum capital and surplus of $5.0 million. Property and casualty insurance companies are also subject to certain risk-based capital requirements by the NAIC. Under those requirements, the amount of capital and surplus maintained by a property and casualty insurance company is determined based on the various risk factors related to it. As of December 31, 2020, AIIC, SOCI and AIICTX exceeded the minimum risk-based capital requirements.",
        "The key financial ratios of the NAIC’s Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, which ratios were developed to assist insurance departments in overseeing the financial condition of insurance companies, are reviewed by experienced financial examiners of the NAIC and state insurance departments to select those companies that merit highest priority in the allocation of the regulators’ resources. IRIS identifies 13 industry ratios and specifies “usual values” for each ratio. Departure from the usual values on four or more of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer’s business.  The 2020 IRIS results for AIIC, SOCI and AIICTX were within expected values for all 13 industry ratios. ",
        "Statutory Accounting Principles",
        "Statutory accounting principles, or SAP, are a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies. SAP is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer’s surplus as regards to policyholders. Accordingly, statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer’s domiciliary state.",
        "Generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, are concerned with a company’s solvency, but are also concerned with other financial measurements, principally income and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management’s stewardship of assets than does SAP. As a direct result, different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP as compared to SAP.",
        "Statutory accounting principles established by the NAIC and adopted in part by Nebraska and Texas insurance regulators, determine, among other things, the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of AIIC, SOCI and AIICTX and thus determine, in part, the amount of funds that are available to pay dividends to AMERISAFE.",

Steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary sheet steel producers and the many end-user manufacturers that require further processing of hot roll coils. The additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling, galvanizing, cutting to length, slitting to size, leveling, blanking, shape correcting, edge rolling, shearing and stamping. We believe that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base. The Columbus Flat Roll Division allows us to capitalize on the industrial markets in the Southern United States and Mexico, as well as further expand our customer base in painted, and line and other pipe products. Galvanized flat roll products produced by our Butler and Columbus Flat Roll Divisions are similar and are sold to a similar customer base. The Techs and Heartland Flat Roll Division specialize in the galvanizing of specific types of flat roll steels in primarily non-automotive applications, servicing a variety of customers in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), construction, agriculture and consumer goods markets. USS adds a complementary distribution channel for metallic coated and pre-paint flat roll steel coils to the niche regional roll-former market, serving the roofing and siding industry.

These factors include the level of domestic steel production (high quality low-residual scrap is a by-product of steel manufacturing activity), the level of exports of scrap from the United States, and the amount of obsolete scrap production. In addition, domestic ferrous scrap prices generally have a strong correlation and spread to global pig iron pricing. Generally, as domestic steel demand increases, so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices. The reverse is also normally, but not always, true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand. When scrap prices greatly accelerate, this can challenge one of the principal elements of an EAF based steel mill’s traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material. ​",
        "Iron Units. In addition to scrap, pig iron, DRI, HBI, and internally sourced liquid pig iron are used in our EAF steel mill production. During 2020, 2019, and 2018, we consumed 10.4 million, 10.6 million and 10.9 million tons, respectively, of metallic materials in our steelmaking furnaces, of which, iron units other than scrap, represented approximately 13% of the tons in 2020 and 2019, and 14% in 2018. ",
        "Energy Resources",
        "Electricity. Electricity is a significant input required in the EAFs in our steelmaking operations, representing between 4% and 5% of steel production costs of goods sold in 2020, 2019 and 2018. We have entered into fixed price electricity contracts for the Butler Flat Roll Division, Columbus Flat Roll Division, Roanoke Bar Division and Steel of West Virginia, while our Engineered Bar Products Division has a combination of fixed pricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services (demand charge, energy charge, riders, etc.). Our Structural and Rail Division purchases electricity at current market prices and through fixed price forward contracts.",

Our operations are dependent upon permits regulating discharges into the environment or the use and handling of by-products in order to operate our facilities. We dedicate considerable resources aimed at achieving compliance with federal, state and local laws concerning the environment. While we do not currently believe that our future compliance efforts with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, this is subject to change in the ever-evolving regulatory environment in which we operate.",
        "Since the interpretation and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations that may be enacted from time to time are subject to changing social or political pressures, our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future. In addition, due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments, the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated.

        "Pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or United States EPA, and authorized state or local environmental agencies may conduct inspections to identify alleged violations or areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to address any such releases. RCRA also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and cleanup. Our steelmaking and certain other facilities generate wastes subject to RCRA. Our operations produce various by-products, some of which, for example EAF dust, are often categorized as hazardous waste, requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics. We collect such by-products in pollution control equipment, such as baghouses, and then recycle what’s possible, and appropriately dispose of the remaining unusable by-products. While we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties, the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities, the costs of which could be substantial.",

Many states have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to CERCLA that can also apply. We have a number of material handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of or recycle our EAF dust and certain other by-products of our operations. However, we cannot assure that, even if there has been no fault by us, we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental cleanup at a site to which our by-products were transported.",

The United States EPA, state agencies and, in certain instances, private parties have the ability to bring suit alleging violations and seeking penalties and damages. The Clean Water Act’s provisions can require new or expanded water treatment investments to be made and can limit or even prohibit certain current or planned activities at our operations.",
        "The Clean Air Act and analogous state and local laws require many of our facilities to obtain and maintain air permits in order to operate. Air permits can impose new or expanded obligations to limit or prevent current or future emissions and to add costly pollution control equipment. Enforcement for alleged violations can be brought by the United States EPA, state agencies, and in certain instances private parties, and can result in substantial penalties and injunctive relief.",
        "In addition, there are a number of other environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations. By way of example and not of limitation, certain portions of the federal Toxic Substances Control Act, Oil Pollution Act, Safe Drinking Water Act and Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies, apply to aspects of our facilities’ operations. In some instances, we may also be subject to foreign governments’ regulations and international treaties and laws. Many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations. Finally, our operations could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance, negligence, trespass, infliction of emotional distress, or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage."

In Brazil, the first quarter is generally the weakest, driven by more consumer vacations and activities associated with Carnival, while the third and fourth quarters tend to be stronger. Other factors unrelated to seasonality, such as changes in economic conditions, manufacturer incentive programs, supply issues, seasonal weather events and/or changes in currency exchange rates may exaggerate seasonal or cause counter-seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating income. ",

In early 2020, we convened a Health Security Task Force of subject matter experts from both inside and outside BXP to develop the BXP Health Security Plan, which we published in May of 2020.

Investments in real estate mortgages run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under such mortgages and that the collateral securing such mortgages may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup our full investment.  We may invest in participating, convertible or traditional mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow, or any appreciation in value of the property or as an entrance to the fee ownership.

Any decision to dispose of a property will be authorized by the Board of Directors of BXP or a committee thereof.  Some holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties that differ from the tax consequences to BXP.  Consequently, holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale.  Such different tax treatment derives in most cases from the fact that we acquired these properties in exchange for partnership interests in contribution transactions structured to allow the prior owners to defer taxable gain.  Generally, this deferral continues so long as we do not dispose of the properties in a taxable transaction.  Unless a sale by us of these properties is structured as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or in a manner that otherwise allows deferral to continue, recognition of the deferred tax gain allocable to these prior owners is generally triggered by a sale.  As of December 31, 2020, we had no properties that were subject to a tax protection agreement.",

FCC catalysts and ebullating-bed hydroprocessing catalysts are consumed at a relatively steady rate and are replaced regularly. Fixed-bed hydroprocessing catalysts are consumed over a period of years and are replaced in bulk in an irregular pattern.

The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended and reauthorized (“Higher Education Act”), and the related regulations govern all higher education institutions participating in federal student aid and loan programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (“Title IV Programs”). According to the National Center for Education Statistics (“NCES”), there were approximately 6,000 postsecondary education institutions eligible for federal student aid in the United States for the academic year 2019-20, including approximately 2,300 for-profit schools; approximately 2,000 public schools which include state universities and community colleges; and approximately 1,800 private non-profit schools. According to the U.S. Department of Education (“ED” or the “Department”), over the 12-month period for academic year 2018-19, approximately 26.3 million students were enrolled in postsecondary institutions.",
        "The domestic postsecondary degree-granting education industry was an approximately $671 billion industry for academic year 2017-18, according to a report published in 2020 by the Department. We compete in this industry primarily with other degree-granting regionally accredited colleges and universities, both for-profit institutions like ours and public and private non-profit institutions. In particular, there is growing competition from online programs at these institutions as they increase their online offerings in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and growing prospective student interest.",

These non-traditional students typically are looking to improve their skills and enhance their earning potential within the context of their careers or in pursuit of new careers. As the industry has shifted to more students with non-traditional characteristics, an increasing proportion of colleges and universities are addressing the needs of working students. This includes colleges and universities with well-established brand names that were historically focused on traditional students.",
        "Although competition exists, for-profit educators serve a segment of the market for postsecondary education that we believe has not been fully addressed by traditional public and private universities. Public and private non-profit institutions can face limited financial resources to expand their offerings in response to growth or changes in the demand for education, due to a combination of state funding challenges, significant expenditures required for research and the professor tenure system. Institutions may also control student enrollments to preserve the perceived prestige and exclusivity of their degree offerings. For-profit providers of postsecondary education offer prospective students the greater flexibility and convenience of their institutions' programmatic offerings and learning structure and an emphasis on applied content and the use of technology in the delivery of the education. At the same time, the share of the postsecondary education market that has been captured by for-profit providers remains relatively small. As a result, we believe that in spite of regulatory and other challenges facing the industry, for-profit postsecondary education providers continue to have significant opportunities to address the demand for postsecondary education.",

        "\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur success depends on the continued contributions from our employees and senior management team. Effective\nsuccession planning is also important for our long-term success. The Nominating and Governance committee of our Board of Directors (“Board”) discusses succession planning annually. The loss of any of our senior management team could harm\nour ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.  Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic  In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. The responses by federal, state and local governments to restrict public gatherings and travel rapidly grew to include\nstay-at-home orders, school closures and mandatory restrictions on non-essential businesses and services that has adversely\naffected workforces, certain economies, and financial markets resulting in a significant economic downturn. We experienced declining revenue from advertising, programming, events and book sales. Several advertisers reduced or ceased advertising\nspend due to the outbreak and stay-at-home orders that effectively shut many businesses down. This was particularly true within our broadcast segment, which derives\nsubstantial revenue from local advertisers who have been particularly hard hit due to social distancing and government interventions and in our publishing segment that sells books in retail stores and through live events. \nWhile this disruption is expected to be temporary, there remains to be considerable uncertainty around the duration. Although advertising revenue continues to\nimprove from the lowest levels experienced during April and May of 2020, it remains significantly below prior years. The exact timing and pace of the recovery has not been determinable as certain markets have reopened, some of which have since\nexperienced a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, resulting in varying degrees of reinstated stay-at-home orders. Due to continuing\nuncertainties regarding the ultimate scope and trajectory of COVID-19’s spread and evolution, it is impossible to predict the total impact that the pandemic will have on our business. If public and\nprivate entities continue to enforce restrictive measures, the material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could persist. Our businesses could also continue to be impacted by the disruptions\nfrom COVID-19 and resulting adverse changes in advertising customers and consumer behavior.  Future availability\nunder our credit facility is contingent upon our eligible receivable balance, which is negatively impacted by lower revenue and longer days to collect. Availability under our Asset Based Loan Facility (“ABL Facility”) is subject to a\nborrowing base consisting of (a) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount based on the value of certain real property. The maximum amount available under our ABL Facility declined to $24.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2020 from $26.4 million at December 31, 2019, of which $5.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2020 compared to $12.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019. \nIn response to these developments, beginning in March 2020, we implemented several measures to reduce costs and conserve cash to ensure that we have adequate\ncash to meet our debt servicing requirements, including:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n limiting capital expenditures; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n reducing discretionary spending, including travel and entertainment; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n eliminating open positions and freezing new hires; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n reducing staffing levels; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n implementing temporary company-wide pay cuts of 5%, 7.5% or 10% depending on salary level; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n furloughing certain employees; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n temporarily suspending the company 401(k) match; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n requesting rent concessions from landlords; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n requesting discounts from vendors; \n  5 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n•\n \n offering early payment discounts to certain customers in exchange for advance cash payments; and\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n suspending the payment of distributions on our common stock indefinitely. \nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act provides\nopportunities for additional liquidity, loan guarantees, and other government programs to support companies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and their employees. On December 27, 2020, Congress passed the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act (“CAA”) that includes a second relief package, which, among other things, provides for an extension of the Payroll Support Program established by the CARES Act. We have utilized certain benefits of the CARES\nAct, and we may be entitled to benefits under the CAA based on our individual locations, including:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n the deferral of all employer FICA taxes beginning in April 2020 for the remainder of 2020, with 50% payable in\nDecember 2021 and the remainder payable in December 2022;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n relaxation of interest expense deduction limitation for income tax purposes; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Payroll Protection Plan (“PPP”) loans available based on the eligibility determined on a per-location basis of up to $11.2 million on a consolidated basis.  We believe that our customers\nhave benefited from the enhanced benefits provided by the CARES Act, and that they will also benefit from the CAA. The CAA provides for another round of direct payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, education funding, and aid to sectors still\nreeling from the economic fallout of the pandemic. While these measures may benefit many of our customers, we cannot assure you that the implementation of these measures will offset the negative impact of\nCOVID-19 on our customers. If the CAA or any additional stimulus measures are not sufficient to remediate the financial stress on our customers as a result of the pandemic, we may experience ongoing challenges\nin growing and maintain revenue and we may experience an increase in delinquencies that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods. \nWe continue to review and consider any available potential benefit under the CARES Act and the CAA for which we qualify. We cannot predict the manner in which\nsuch benefits or any of the other benefits described herein will be allocated or administered and we cannot assure you that we will be able to access such benefits in a timely manner or at all. If the U.S. government or any other governmental\nauthority agrees to provide such aid under the CARES Act, the CAA, or any other crisis relief assistance it may impose certain requirements on the recipients of the aid, including restrictions on executive officer compensation, dividends, prepayment\nof debt, limitations on debt and other similar restrictions that may apply for a period of time after the aid is repaid or redeemed in full.  Due to the\nadverse economic impact, we reforecast our anticipated results extending through March 2022. Our reforecast includes the impact of certain of these cost-cutting measures. Based on our current and expected economic outlook and our current and\nexpected funding needs, we believe that the borrowing capacity under our current credit facilities, together with cash on hand, allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund necessary capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service\nrequirements for at least the next twelve months, including the working capital deficit at December 31, 2020. Based on our current assessment, we believe that we have the ability to meet our obligations as they come due for one year from the\nissuance of this annual report.  Recent Developments \nCyber Incident  On August 7, 2020, we detected a\nransomware attack impacting certain of our operational and information technology systems. We promptly launched an investigation, notified law enforcement and engaged the services of specialized incident response professionals. We have recovered our\nbusiness systems and critical operational \n  6 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ndata. Based on our investigation, we believe the incident has not had a material impact on our business, operations or financial condition. We believe that our cyber insurance coverage is\ncommensurate with our size and the nature of our operations.  Debt Transactions \nOn October 20, 2020, we entered into a fourth amendment to our ABL Facility that provides a one-time waiver with\nrespect to the current covenant testing period allowing the covenant trigger event date to be the first day after the availability on the ABL Facility had equaled or exceeded (1) 15% of the maximum revolver amount and (2) $4.5 million and a\nwaiver permitting our July 2020 financial statements to be issued on or before September 30, 2020 due to delays that were caused by a ransomware attack. \nOn April 7, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to ABL Facility that increased the advance rate on eligible accounts receivable from 85% to 90% and\nextended the maturity date from May 19, 2022 to March 1, 2024. The April 7, 2020 amendment also allows for an alternative benchmark rate that may include SOFR due to LIBOR being scheduled to be discontinued at the end of calendar year\n2021.  During January 2020 we completed repurchases of $3.5 million of the 6.75% Senior Secured Notes (“Notes”) for $3.4 million in\ncash, recognizing a net gain of $49,000 after adjusting for bond issuance costs as detailed in Note 12– Long-Term Debt of our Consolidated Financial Statements. \nEquity Transactions  Distributions of $0.7 million\n($0.025 per share) were declared and paid in March 2020 based upon our Board of Directors’ (“Board”) then current assessment of our business as detailed in Note 19 – Equity Transactions of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n Acquisitions  On September 15, 2020, we\nacquired the Hyper Pixels Media website and related assets for $1.1 million in cash. We paid $0.4 million in cash upon closing with deferred payments of $0.4 million due January 31, 2021 and $0.3 million due\nSeptember 15, 2021. We recorded goodwill of approximately $0.1 million associated with the expected synergies to be realized upon combining the operations into our digital media platform within Salem Web Network (“SWN”) and from\nbrand loyalty from Hyper Pixel Media’s existing subscriber base that is not a separately identifiable intangible asset. The accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations reflects the operating results of this entity as of the closing date\nwithin our digital media segment.  Divestitures  On\nApril 6, 2020, we sold radio station WBZW-AM and an FM translator construction permit in Orlando, Florida, for $0.2 million in cash. We recognized an estimated\npre-tax loss of approximately $1.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2019, which reflects the sale price as compared to the carrying value of the assets less the estimated closing\ncosts.  Pending Transactions  On September 10,\n2020, we entered an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) to sell radio station WKAT-AM and an FM translator in Miami, Florida, for $3.5 million in cash. We will exit the Miami market upon the close\nof this transaction. We entered a Local Marketing Agreement (“LMA”) under which the buyer will begin programming the station in November 2020. We recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of\n$1.4 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, which reflects the sale price as compared to the carrying value of the assets sold, the estimated closing costs, and the write-off\nof the remaining Miami assets as a result of exiting this market. This transaction is subject to the approval of the FCC and is expected to close during the first half of 2021. \n  7 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOn February 5, 2020, we entered an APA with Word Broadcasting to sell radio stations WFIA-AM, WFIA-FM and WGTK-AM in Louisville, Kentucky for $4.0 million with credits applied from amounts previously paid, including\na portion of the monthly fees paid under a Time Brokerage Agreement (“TBA.”) Due to changes in debt markets, the transaction was not funded, and it is uncertain when, or if, the transaction will close. Word Broadcasting continues to\nprogram the stations under a TBA that began in January 2017.  Broadcasting \nOur broadcast segment includes the operating results of our radio stations, broadcast networks, and our national sales agencies including our full-service\ndigital agency, Salem Surround. National companies often prefer to advertise across the United States as an efficient and cost-effective way to reach their target audiences. Our national platform under which we offer radio airtime, digital campaigns\nand print advertisements can benefit national companies by reaching audiences throughout the United States.  Radio Stations \nWe own and/or operate 99 radio stations in 35 markets, including 58 radio stations in 23 of the top 25 markets, consisting of 33 FM radio\nstations and 66 AM radio stations. We also program the Family Talk® Christian-themed talk format station on SiriusXM Channel 131. We are one of only three commercial radio broadcasters\nwith radio stations in all the top 10 markets. We are the sixth largest commercial radio broadcaster in the United States as measured by number of radio stations overall and the third largest operator as measured by number of stations in the top 25\nmarkets.  We program our radio stations in three main formats: (1) Christian Teaching and Talk, (2) News Talk and\n(3) Contemporary Christian Music (“CCM”). Other radio station formats include Spanish language Christian Teaching and Talk, Business, Country, Urban, and Classic Hits. \nChristian Teaching and Talk. We currently program 37 of our radio stations in our foundational format, Christian Teaching and Talk,\nwhich is talk programming emphasizing Christian and family themes. Through this format, a listener can hear Bible teachings and sermons, as well as gain insight to questions related to daily life, such as raising children or religious legal rights\nin education and in the workplace. This format uses block programming time to offer a learning resource and a source of personal support for listeners. Listeners often contact our programmers to donate, ask questions and obtain materials on a\nsubject matter or receive study guides based on what they have learned on the radio.  Block Programming. We recognize revenue from\nthe sale of blocks of airtime to program producers that typically consist of 121/2, 25 or 50-minutes\nof time. We sell blocks of airtime on our Christian Teaching and Talk format stations to a variety of national and local religious and charitable organizations that we believe create compelling radio programs. National programmers, such as\nestablished non-profit religious and educational organizations, typically purchase time on a Monday through Friday basis with supplemental programming blocks available for weekend release. Local programmers,\nsuch as community churches and organizations, typically purchase blocks for weekend releases. Historically, more than 95% of these national religious and charitable organizations renew their annual programming relationships with us. Based on our\nhistorical renewal rates, we believe that block programming provides a steady and consistent source of revenue and cash flows. Our top ten programmers have remained relatively constant and average more than 30 years\non-air with us. Over the last five years, block-programming has generated 40% to 43% of our total net broadcast revenue. \nSatellite Radio. We program SiriusXM Channel 131, the exclusive Christian Teaching and Talk channel on SiriusXM, reaching the entire\nnation 24 hours a day, seven days a week.   News Talk. We currently program 32 of our radio stations in a News Talk format.\nOur research shows that our News Talk format is highly complementary to our core Christian Teaching and Talk format. As programmed by Salem, both formats express conservative views and family values. Our News Talk\n\n  8 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nformat allows us to leverage syndicated talk programming produced by Salem Radio NetworkTM (“SRNTM”) to radio stations throughout the United States. Syndication of our programs allows us to reach audiences in markets in which we do not own or operate radio stations. \nContemporary Christian Music. We currently program 12 of our radio stations in a Contemporary Christian Music (“CCM”) format,\nbranded The FISH® in most markets. Through the CCM format, we bring listeners the words of inspirational recording artists, set to upbeat contemporary music. Our music format, branded\n“Safe for the Whole Family”, features sounds and lyrics that listeners of all ages can enjoy and appreciate. The CCM genre continues to be popular. We believe that the listener base for CCM is underserved in terms of radio coverage,\nparticularly in larger markets, and that our stations fill an otherwise void area in listener choices.

Books are sold in traditional printed form and as eBooks with the following categories: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Regnery History—Regnery History brings new light to old subjects and introduces stories that deserve\nattention but may have been ignored or even covered up in the past.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Regnery Kids—Regnery Kidsbooks are non-partisan, entertaining, and\nbrilliantly written and illustrated by award-winning authors and artists.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Regnery Fiction—Regnery Fiction publishes exciting, thrilling stories with characters who embody American\nvalues and plots that explore controversial issues on the forefront of the American consciousness.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Gateway Editions—Regnery Gateway, dedicated to serious works of cultural, social, and political analysis, is\na reaffirmation of Regnery’s tradition of publishing original and penetrating conservative thinkers.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Salem Books—Our goal is to help people grow in their faith, and find comfort, encouragement, practical\nadvice, and timeless wisdom in compelling books by trusted authors.  Salem Author Services is a self-publishing service for authors\nthrough Xulon Press and Mill City Press. Xulon Press offers print-on-demand self-publishing services for Christian authors while Mill City Press serves most general\nmarket publications.  Singing News®\nproduces and distributes a print magazine for readers interested in southern gospel music.  Competition \nWe operate in a highly competitive broadcast and media business. We compete for audiences, advertisers and programmers with other radio broadcasters, broadcast\nand cable television operators, newspapers and magazines, book publishers, national and local digital services, outdoor advertising, direct mail, online marketing and media companies, social media platforms,\nweb-based blogs, and mobile devices.  BROADCASTING. Our broadcast audience ratings and\nmarket shares are subject to change, and any change in a particular market could adversely affect the revenue of our stations located in that market. While we already compete in some of our markets with stations that offer similar formats, if\nanother radio station were to convert its programming to a format similar to one of ours, or if an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations, our stations could suffer reduced ratings and/or reduced revenue. In these circumstances, we\ncould also incur significantly higher promotional and other related expenses. We cannot assure that our stations will maintain or increase their current audience ratings and revenue. \nWe compete for advertising revenue with other commercial religious format stations as well as general format radio stations. Our competition\nfor advertising dollars includes other radio stations as well as digital websites and social media, broadcast television, cable television, newspapers, magazines, direct mail and billboard advertising, some of which may be controlled by horizontally\nintegrated companies. Several factors can materially affect competitive advantage, including, but not limited to, audience ratings, program content, management talent and expertise, sales talent and experience, audience characteristics, signal\nstrength, and the number and characteristics of other radio stations in the same market. \n  16 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChristian and Family-Themed Radio. The segment of this industry that focuses on\nChristian and family themes is also a highly competitive business. The financial success of each of our radio stations that focuses on Christian Teaching and Talk is dependent, to a significant degree, upon its ability to generate revenue from the\nsale of block program time to national and local religious and educational organizations. We compete for this program revenue with a number of different commercial and non-commercial radio station licensees.\nWhile we believe that no commercial group owner in the United States specializing in Christian and family-themed programming approaches Salem in size of potential listening audience and presence in major markets, other religious radio stations exist\nand enjoy varying degrees of prominence and success in each of our markets.  New Methods of Content Delivery. Competition also comes\nfrom new media technologies and services. These include delivery of audio programming by cable television and satellite systems, digital audio radio services, mobile devices including smart phone applications for iPhone® and Android®, personal communications services, social media, and the service of low powered, limited coverage FM radio stations\nauthorized by the FCC. The delivery of live and stored audio programming through the Internet has also created new competition. In addition, satellite delivered digital audio radio, which delivers multiple audio programming formats to national\naudiences, has created competition. We have attempted to address these existing and potential competitive threats through a more active strategy to acquire and integrate new electronic communications formats including digital acquisitions, the\nlaunch of Salem Surround, and our exclusive arrangement to provide Christian and family-themed talk on SiriusXM, a satellite digital audio radio service. \nNETWORK. SRNTM competes with other commercial radio networks that offer news and\ntalk programming to religious and general format stations and noncommercial networks that offer Christian music formats. SRNTM also competes with other radio networks for the services of talk show\npersonalities.  DIGITAL MEDIA. SWN and Townhall Media compete for visitors and advertisers with other companies that deliver\nonline audio programming, that deliver Christian and conservative digital content, and providers of general market websites and social media. The online media and distribution business changes quickly and is highly competitive. We compete to attract\nand maintain interactions with advertisers, consumers, content creators and web publishers. Salem Church Products competes for customers with other online sites that offer resources useful in ministries, preaching, teaching and for employment within\nthe Christian community.  PUBLISHING. Regnery® Publishing competes with\nother book publishers for readers and book sales as well as competes for product quality, customer service, suitability of format and subject matter, author reputation, price, timely availability of both new titles and revisions of existing books,\ndigital availability of published products, and timely delivery of products to customers. Our print magazine competes for readers and advertisers with other print publications, including those geared toward Christian audiences. Salem Author Services\ncompetes for authors with other on-demand publishers including those focused exclusively on Christian book publishers. \nFederal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting \nIntroduction. The ownership, operation and sale of broadcast stations, including those licensed to Salem, are subject to the jurisdiction of the\nFCC, which acts under authority derived from The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Communications Act”). Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands for broadcasting;\ndetermines whether to approve certain changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates transmission facilities, including power employed, antenna and tower heights, and location of transmission facilities; adopts and implements\nregulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of stations; and has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules under the Communications Act. \n  17 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of specific FCC\nregulations and policies. Failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures, the grant of “short” (less than the maximum) license renewal terms or, for\nparticularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of a license or the denial of FCC consent to acquire additional broadcast properties. For further information concerning the nature and extent of federal\nregulation of broadcast stations you should refer to the Communications Act, FCC rules and the public notices and rulings of the FCC.  License Grant\nand Renewal. Radio broadcast licenses are granted for maximum terms of eight years. Licenses must be renewed through an application to the FCC. Under the Communications Act, the FCC will renew a broadcast license if it finds that the station\nhas served the public interest, convenience and necessity, that there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC, and that there have been no other violations by the licensee of\nthe Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC that, when taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse.  From time to time, the\nrenewal of certain licenses may be delayed. We continue to operate these radio stations under their existing licenses until the licenses are renewed. The affected stations are authorized to continue operations until the FCC acts upon the renewal\napplications. We continually monitor our stations’ compliance with the various regulatory requirements that are necessary for the FCC renewal. We are currently in the midst of the FCC’s radio renewal cycle, and license renewal applications\nfor certain of our stations will be pending during the course of the renewal cycle. We expect all of our broadcast licenses to be renewed by its conclusion. \nPetitions to deny license renewals can be filed by certain interested parties, including members of the public in a station’s market. Such petitions may\nraise various issues before the FCC. The FCC is required to hold hearings on renewal applications if the FCC is unable to determine that renewal of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity, or if a petition to deny raises\na “substantial and material question of fact” as to whether the grant of the renewal application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity. In addition, during certain periods when a\nrenewal application is pending, the transferability of the applicant’s license is restricted.  The following table sets forth information with\nrespect to each of our radio stations for which we hold the license. Stations that we operate under an LMA or TBA are not reflected on this table. A broadcast station’s market may be different from its community of license. The coverage of an\nAM radio station is chiefly a function of the power of the radio station’s transmitter, less dissipative power losses and any directional antenna adjustments. For FM radio stations, signal coverage area is chiefly a function of the Effective\nRadiated Power (“ERP”) of the radio station’s antenna and the Height Above Average Terrain (“HAAT”) of the radio station’s antenna.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Market (1)\n \nStation CallLetters\n \nFrequency\n \nOperatingFrequency\n \nExpirationDate ofLicense\n \nFCCClass\n \nHeight

The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast license\nwithout the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to assign, transfer, grant or renew a broadcast license, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee, including compliance with various rules limiting common\nownership of media properties, the “character” of the licensee and those persons holding “attributable” interests therein, and compliance with the Communications Act’s limitation on alien ownership, as well as compliance\nwith other FCC policies, including equal employment opportunity requirements. \n  21 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFCC rules and policies define the interests of individuals and entities, known as “attributable”\ninterests, which implicate FCC rules governing ownership of broadcast stations. and other specified mass media entities. Under these rules, attributable interests generally include: (1) officers and directors of a licensee and of its direct and\nindirect parents; (2) general partners; (3) limited partners and limited liability company members, unless properly “insulated” from management activities; (4) a 5% or more direct or indirect voting stock interest in a\ncorporate licensee or parent, except that, for a narrowly defined class of passive investors, the attribution threshold is a 20% or more voting stock interest; and (5) combined equity and debt interests in excess of 33% of a licensee’s\ntotal asset value, if the interest holder provides over 15% of the licensee station’s total weekly programming, or has an attributable same-service (radio or television) broadcast or newspaper interest in the same market (the “EDP\nRule”). An entity that owns one or more radio stations in a market and programs more than 15% of the broadcast time or sells more than 15% per week of the advertising time on a radio station in the same market is generally deemed to have an\nattributable interest in that station. Debt instruments, non-voting corporate stock, minority voting stock interests in corporations having a single majority stockholder, and properly insulated limited\npartnership and limited liability company interests generally are not subject to attribution unless such interests implicate the EDP Rule.  The FCC\nownership rules relevant to our business are summarized below. Because of these rules, a purchaser of voting stock of the company that acquires an “attributable” interest in the company may violate the FCC’s rule if it also has an\nattributable interest in another radio station, depending on the number and location of those radio stations. Such a purchaser also may be restricted in the other companies in which it may invest, to the extent that these investments give rise to an\nattributable interest. If an attributable stockholder of the company violates any of these ownership rules, the company may be unable to obtain from the FCC one or more authorizations needed to conduct its radio station business and may be unable to\nobtain FCC consents for certain future acquisitions.  Foreign Ownership: Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or\nheld by a corporation that has more than one-fifth of its capital stock owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by\nnon-U.S. corporations. Under the Communications Act, there are limitations on the licensee of a broadcast license, that is held by any corporation that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by any other\ncorporation more than one-fourth of whose capital stock is owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by\nnon-U.S. corporations. These restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships. We therefore may be restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted by aliens, foreign governments or non-U.S. corporations, although the FCC will entertain and authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing, proposals to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcasting holding companies. The FCC\ngenerally will not make such a determination absent favorable executive branch review.  Local Radio Ownership: The maximum allowable number of\nradio stations that may be commonly owned in a market is based on the size of the market. In markets with 45 or more stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to eight stations, of which no more than five are in the same radio\nservice (AM or FM). In markets with 30-44 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to seven stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 15-29 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to six stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 14 or fewer stations, one entity may have an attributable\ninterest in up to five stations, of which no more than three are in the same service, so long as the entity does not have an interest in more than 50% of all stations in the market. To apply these ownership tiers, the FCC relies on Nielsen Metro\nSurvey Areas, where they exist, and a signal contour-overlap methodology where they do not exist. An FCC rulemaking is pending to determine how to define radio markets for stations located outside Nielsen Metro Survey Areas. \nThe FCC also restricts the number of television stations an entity may own both in local markets and nationwide. \n  22 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur current ownership of radio broadcast stations complies with the FCC’s multiple ownership rules;\nhowever, these rules may limit the number of additional stations that we may acquire in the future in certain of our markets.  Cross-Ownership: The\nnewspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule prohibits an individual or entity from having an attributable interest in either a radio or television station and a daily newspaper located in the same market, subject to certain exceptions and with waivers\navailable in particular cases. The radio/television cross-ownership rule limits common ownership of television stations and same market radio stations. In general, an individual or entity may hold attributable interests in one television station and\nup to seven same-market radio stations (or two television stations and up to six same-market radio stations), depending on the number of independently owned radio, television and other specified media “voices” in the market. \nReview of Media Ownership Rules: The FCC is required by statute to review all of its broadcast ownership rules on a quadrennial basis (i.e.,\nevery four years) and to repeal or modify any of its rules that are no longer “necessary in the public interest.” Despite several such reviews and appellate remands, the FCC’s rules limiting the number of radio stations that may be\ncommonly owned in a local market have remained largely intact since their initial adoption following the 1996 Act. The FCC’s previous ownership reviews have been subject to litigation. \nIn November 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a decision that resulted in reinstatement of the cross-ownership rules,\nwhich the FCC had previously eliminated. The Supreme Court of the United States granted petitions for certiorari seeking review of the Third Circuit decision and heard argument on January 19, 2021. The case remains pending. The FCC initiated\nits 2018 quadrennial review in December 2018 and that proceeding remains pending. Among other things, the FCC is seeking comment on all aspects of the local radio ownership rule’s implementation and whether the current version of the rule\nremains necessary in the public interest. We cannot predict whether the appeal or forthcoming review proceeding will result in modifications of the ownership rules or the impact (if any) that such modifications would have on our business. \nFederal Antitrust Considerations. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), which evaluate\ntransactions to determine whether those transactions should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws, are also active in their review of radio station acquisitions, particularly where an operator proposes to acquire additional stations in its\nexisting markets.  For an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Improvements Act (“HSR Act”) and the rules\npromulgated thereunder require the parties to file Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition. At any time before or after the consummation of a\nproposed acquisition, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws, as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or other\nassets of the company. The FTC or the DOJ may investigate acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the HSR Act under the antitrust laws before or after consummation. In addition, private parties may under certain circumstances bring\nlegal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws. The DOJ also has stated publicly that it believes that LMAs and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers prior to the expiration\nof the waiting period under the HSR Act could violate the HSR Act.  We can provide no assurances that our acquisition strategy will not be adversely\naffected in any material respect by antitrust reviews.  Geographic Financial Information \nOur customers are based in various locations throughout the United States. While no one customer currently accounts for 10% or more of our total revenue\nindividually or in the aggregate, our broadcast operating segment is particularly dependent on revenue generated from our Los Angeles and Dallas broadcast markets. Our Los \n  23 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nAngeles radio stations generated 10.6% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 11.6% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019. Our Dallas radio stations generated 9.3% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 10.1% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. \nBecause substantial portions of our broadcast revenue is derived from our Los Angeles and Dallas markets, our ability to generate revenue in those markets\ncould be adversely affected by local or regional economic downturns in these areas.

Not\nrequired for smaller reporting companies.  ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. \nNone.  ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\n We own or lease various properties throughout the United States from which we conduct business. No one physical property is material to our overall\nbusiness operations. We believe that each of our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to upgrade our properties. We believe that we will be able to renew existing leases\nwhen applicable or obtain comparable facilities, as necessary.  Executive Offices \nOur executive offices are located in Irving, Texas, where we own an approximately 43,000 square foot office building. \nBroadcasting  Our broadcast facilities include\noffices and studios, transmitter locations, antenna sites and tower sites. Offices and studios are typically located in buildings that are in a downtown or business district. Transmitter, antenna and tower sites are located in areas that provide\nmaximum market coverage. Our radio stations broadcast from 89 tower sites, including 44 tower sites in which we own the land.  SRNTM, SMR , Salem Consumer Products, our Dallas radio stations studios and offices, and our executive offices are located in the Dallas, Texas metropolitan area. We also own office buildings in Honolulu,\nHawaii; Tampa, Florida; Orlando, Florida and Greenville, South Carolina from which our radio stations studios and offices operate. Our national radio network operates from various offices and studios. These studios may be used to generate\nprogramming or programming can also be relayed from a remote point of origination. Our network also leases satellite transponders used in the delivery of its programming. \nOur current lease agreements range from four months to twenty-eight years remaining on the lease term. We lease certain property from our principal\nstockholders or trusts and partnerships created for the benefit of the principal stockholders and their families. These leases are described in Note 17, Related Party Transactions in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in\nItem 8 of this annual report. \n  24 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhile none of our owned or leased properties is individually material to our operations, if we were required\nto relocate any of our broadcast towers, the cost would be significant. Significant costs are due to the moving and reconstruction of the tower as well as the limited number of sites in any geographic area that permit a tower of reasonable height to\nprovide adequate market coverage. These limitations are due to zoning and other land use restrictions, as well as Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations. \nDigital Media  Our digital media entities operate\nfrom office buildings and require additional data storage centers. SWN operates from leased office facilities in Richmond, Virginia and Nashville, Tennessee. Townhall Media operates from a leased facility in Arlington, Virginia that is shared with\nour radio stations and Eagle Financial Publications. Our current lease agreements range from one to six years remaining on the lease term. \nPublishing  Regnery® Publishing operates from a leased facility in Washington, D.C. with inventory fulfillment managed by a third-party in Delran, New Jersey. Salem Author Services operates from a leased facility in\nOrlando, Florida. Singing News® operates from a leased facility in Nashville, Tennessee that is shared with our broadcasting operations in that market. Our current lease agreements\nrange from two to three years remaining on the lease term.  Corporate \nCertain corporate administrative functions are performed in Camarillo, California where we own an approximately 46,000 square foot office building. \nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. \nWe and our subsidiaries, incident to our business activities, are parties to a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits, arbitration and other claims. Such\nmatters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance. We maintain insurance that may provide coverage for such matters. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary\nliability or the financial impact with respect to these matters. We believe, at this time, that the final resolution of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not adversely affect upon our annual consolidated financial position,\nresults of operations or cash flows.

The actual declaration of any future equity distributions and the establishment of the per share amount, record dates, and payment dates are subject\nto final determination by our Board and dependent upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements, and other factors. The reduction or elimination of equity distributions may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\n On May 6, 2020 our Board voted to discontinue distributions on our common stock indefinitely due to the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

(“Salem”\n“we” “us” “our” and “its”) is a domestic multimedia company specializing in Christian and conservative content, with media properties comprising radio broadcasting, digital media, and publishing. Our content\nis intended for audiences interested in Christian and family-themed programming and \n  27 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nconservative news talk. We maintain a website at www.salemmedia.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports\nare electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information on our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference into this or any other report of the company filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. \nWe have three operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating\nsegments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of senior executives, assess the performance of each operating segment and determine the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We\ncontinually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our business and may make changes as necessary.  We measure\nand evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that exclude costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury. We also exclude costs such as\namortization, depreciation, taxes and interest expense when evaluating the performance of our operating segments.  Our principal sources of broadcast\nrevenue include:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of block program time to national and local program producers; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of advertising time on our radio stations to national and local advertisers; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of banner advertisements on our station websites or on our mobile applications; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of digital streaming advertisements on our station websites or on our mobile applications;\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of advertisements included in digital newsletters; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n fees earned for the creation of custom web pages and custom digital media campaigns for our advertisers through\nSalem Surround;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of advertising time on our national network; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the syndication of programming on our national network; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n product sales and royalties for on-air host materials, including podcasts\nand programs; and   \n\n\n \n•\n \n other revenue such as events, including ticket sales and sponsorships, listener purchase programs, where revenue\nis generated from special discounts and incentives offered to our listeners from our advertisers; talent fees for voice-overs or custom endorsements from our on-air personalities and production services, and\nlease income for studios, towers or office space.  Our principal sources of digital media revenue include: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of digital banner advertisements on our websites and mobile applications; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of digital streaming advertisements on websites and mobile applications; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the support and promotion to stream third-party content on our websites; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of advertisements included in digital newsletters; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the digital delivery of newsletters to subscribers; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the number of video and graphic downloads. \nOur principal sources of publishing revenue include:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of books and e-books; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n publishing fees from authors; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of digital advertising on our magazine websites and digital newsletters; \n  28 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n•\n \n subscription fees for our print magazine; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of print magazine advertising. \nIn each of our operating segments, the rates we can charge for airtime, advertising and other products and services are dependent upon several factors,\nincluding:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n audience share;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n how well our programs and advertisements perform for our clients; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the size of the market and audience reached; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the number of impressions delivered; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the number of advertisements and programs streamed; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the number of page views achieved; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the number of downloads completed; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the number of events held, the number of event sponsorships sold and the attendance at each event;\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n demand for books and publications; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n general economic conditions; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n supply and demand for airtime on a local and national level. \nBroadcasting  Our foundational business is radio\nbroadcasting, which includes the ownership and operation of radio stations in large metropolitan markets, our national networks and our national sales firms including Salem Surround. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description\nof our broadcasting operations.  Revenue generated from our radio stations, networks and sales firms is reported as broadcast revenue in our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. Advertising revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the advertiser, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. \nBroadcast revenue is impacted by the rates radio stations can charge for programming and advertising time, the level of airtime sold to programmers and\nadvertisers, the number of impressions delivered or downloads made, and the number of events held, including the size of the event and the number of attendees. Block programming rates are based upon our stations’ ability to attract audiences\nthat will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products. Advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time, which in turn is based on our stations and networks’ ability to produce results for\ntheir advertisers. We market ourselves to advertisers based on the responsiveness of our audiences. We do not subscribe to traditional audience measuring services for most of our radio stations. In select markets, we subscribe to Nielsen Audio,\nwhich develops monthly reports measuring a radio station’s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers. Each of our radio stations and our networks has a pre-determined level of time\navailable for block programming and/or advertising, which may vary at different times of the day.  Nielsen Audio uses the Portable People Meter TM (“PPM”) technology to collect data for its ratings service. PPM is a small device that is capable of automatically measuring radio,\ntelevision, Internet, satellite radio and satellite television signals encoded by the broadcaster. The PPM offers a number of advantages over traditional diary ratings collection systems, including ease of use, more reliable ratings data, shorter\ntime periods between when \n  29 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nadvertising runs and actual listening data, and little manipulation of data by users. A disadvantage of the\nPPM includes data fluctuations from changes to the “panel” (a group of individuals holding PPM devices). This makes all stations susceptible to some inconsistencies in ratings that may or may not accurately reflect the actual number of\nlisteners at any given time. We subscribe to Nielsen Audio for ratings services in 7 of our broadcast markets.  Our results are subject to seasonal\nfluctuations. As is typical in the broadcasting industry, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue typically exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. Seasonal fluctuations in advertising revenue correspond with quarterly\nfluctuations in the retail industry. Additionally, we experience increased demand for political advertising during election, or even numbered years, over non-election or odd numbered years. Political\nadvertising revenue varies based on the number and type of candidates as well as the number and type of debated issues.  Our cash flows from broadcasting\nare affected by transitional periods experienced by radio stations when, based on the nature of the radio station, our plans for the market and other circumstances, we find it beneficial to change the station format. During this transitional period,\nwhen we develop a radio station’s listener and customer base, the station may generate negative or insignificant cash flow.  In broadcasting, trade\nor barter agreements are commonly used to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services. We may enter barter agreements to exchange airtime or digital advertising for goods or services that can be used in our business or\nthat can be sold to our audience under Listener Purchase Programs. The terms of these barter agreements permit us to preempt the barter airtime or digital campaign in favor of customers who purchase the airtime or digital campaign for cash. The\nvalue of these non-cash exchanges is included in revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the goods or services we receive. Each transaction must be reviewed to determine that the products, supplies\nand/or services we receive have economic substance, or value to us. We record barter operating expenses upon receipt and usage of the products, supplies and services, as applicable. We record barter revenue as advertising spots or digital campaigns\nare delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Barter revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which case,\nrevenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 98% and 97%, respectively, of our broadcast revenue was sold for cash. \nBroadcast operating expenses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as\nlease expense and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) production and programming expenses, and (v) music license fees. In addition to these expenses, our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for\nsatellite communication facilities.  Digital Media \nOur digital media based businesses provide Christian, conservative, investing, e-commerce, audio and video streaming,\nand other resources digitally through the web. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of each of our digital media websites and operations. \nRevenue generated from this segment is reported as digital media revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this annual report. Digital\nmedia revenue is impacted by the rates our sites can charge for advertising time, the level of advertisements sold, the number of impressions delivered or the number of products sold and the number of digital subscriptions sold. Like our\nbroadcasting segment, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. This seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail\nadvertising industry. We also experience fluctuations in quarter-over-quarter comparisons based on the date on which Easter is observed, as this holiday generates a higher volume of product downloads from our church product websites. Additionally,\nwe experience increased demand for advertising time and placement during election years for political advertisements. \n  30 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe primary operating expenses incurred by our digital media businesses include: (i) employee salaries,\ncommissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as lease expense and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) royalties, (v) streaming costs, and (vi) cost of goods sold\nassociated with e-commerce sites.  Publishing \nOur publishing operations include book publishing through Regnery® Publishing, self-publishing\nservices through Salem Author Services and Singing News Magazine. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of each of our publishing operations. \nRevenue generated from this segment is reported as publishing revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this annual report. Publishing\nrevenue is impacted by the retail price of books and e-books, the number of books sold, the number and retail price of e-books sold, the number and rate of print\nmagazine subscriptions sold, the rate and number of pages of advertisements sold in each print magazine, and the number and rate at which self-published books are published. Regnery®\nPublishing revenue is impacted by elections as it generates higher levels of interest and demand for publications containing conservative and political based opinions. \nThe primary operating expenses incurred by our publishing businesses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes,\n(ii) facility expenses such as lease expense and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses; and (iv) cost of goods sold that includes printing and production costs, fulfillment costs, author royalties and inventory reserves.\n Known Trends and Uncertainties  In March 2020, the\nWorld Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. The responses by federal, state and local governments to restrict public gatherings and travel rapidly grew to include stay-at-home orders, school closures and mandatory restrictions on non-essential businesses and services that has adversely affected\nworkforces, certain economies, and financial markets resulting in a significant economic downturn. We experienced declining revenue from advertising, programming, events and book sales. Several advertisers reduced or ceased advertising spend due to\nthe outbreak and stay-at-home orders that effectively shut many businesses down. This was particularly true within our broadcast segment, which derives substantial\nrevenue from local advertisers who have been particularly hard hit due to social distancing and government interventions and in our publishing segment that sells books in retail stores and through live events. \nWhile this disruption is expected to be temporary, there remains to be considerable uncertainty around the duration. Although advertising revenue continues to\nimprove from the lowest levels experienced during April and May of 2020, it remains significantly below prior years. The exact timing and pace of the recovery has not been determinable as certain markets have reopened, some of which have since\nexperienced a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, resulting in varying degrees of reinstated stay-at-home orders. Due to continuing\nuncertainties regarding the ultimate scope and trajectory of COVID-19’s spread and evolution, it is impossible to predict the total impact that the pandemic will have on our business. If public and\nprivate entities continue to enforce restrictive measures, the material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could persist. Our businesses could also continue to be impacted by the disruptions\nfrom COVID-19 and resulting adverse changes in advertising customers and consumer behavior.  Future availability\nunder our credit facility is contingent upon our eligible receivable balance, which is negatively impacted by lower revenue and longer days to collect. Availability under our ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of (a) 90% of the\neligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount based on the value of certain real property. The maximum amount available under our ABL Facility declined to $24.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $26.4 million at\nDecember 31, 2019, of which $5.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2020 compared to $12.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019. \n  31 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe growth of broadcast revenue associated with the sale of airtime remains challenged. We believe this is\ndue to increased competition from other forms of content distribution and the length of time spent listening to audio streaming services, podcasts and satellite radio. Increases in competition and the mix in listening time may lead advertisers to\nconclude that the effectiveness of radio has diminished. To minimize the impact of these factors, we continue to enhance our digital assets to complement our broadcast content. The increase use of voice activated platforms, or smart speakers, that\nprovide audiences with the ability to access AM and FM radio stations show increased potential for broadcasters to reach audiences.  Our broadcast revenue\nis particularly dependent on advertising from our Los Angeles and Dallas markets, which generated 10.6% and 9.3% respectively, of our total net broadcast revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 11.6% and 10.1%, respectively,\nof our total net broadcast revenue during the same period of the prior year.  Revenue from print magazines, including advertising revenue and subscription\nrevenue, is challenged due to lower demand from the audiences that increasingly use other mediums that deliver comparable information. Book sales are contingent upon overall economic conditions and our ability to attract and retain authors.\nDecreases in digital revenue could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and results of operations. Digital revenue is impacted by the nature and delivery of page views and the number of advertisements per page. We have\nexperienced a shift in the number of page views from desktop devices to mobile devices. While mobile page views have increased dramatically, they carry a lower number of advertisements per page and are generally sold at lower rates. A shift from\ndesktop page views to mobile device views negatively impacts revenue as mobile devices carry lower rates and less advertisement per page. To minimize the impact that any one of these areas could have, we continue to explore opportunities to\ncross-promote our brands and our content, and to strategically monitor costs.  Key Financial Performance Indicators—Same-Station Definition\n In the discussion of our results of operations below, we compare our broadcast operating results between periods on an\nas-reported basis, which includes the operating results of all radio stations and networks owned or operated at any time during either period and on a Same Station basis. Same Station is a Non-GAAP financial measure used both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community as well as in our internal evaluations and management of the business. We believe that Same Station\nOperating Income provides a meaningful comparison of period over period performance of our core broadcast operations as this measure excludes the impact of new stations, the impact of stations we no longer own or operate, and the impact of stations\noperating under a new programming format. Our presentation of Same Station Operating Income is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Refer\nto “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” below for definitions and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP performance measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \nManagement uses certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below in communications with investors, analysts, rating\nagencies, banks and others to assist such parties in understanding the impact of various items on our financial statements. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate financial results, develop\nbudgets, manage expenditures and as a measure of performance under compensation programs.  Our presentation of these\nnon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable financial measures as reported in accordance with GAAP. \nItem 10(e) of Regulation S-K defines and prescribes the conditions under which certain\nnon-GAAP financial information may be presented in this annual report. We closely monitor EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Station Operating Income (“SOI”), Same Station net broadcast revenue, Same Station\nbroadcast operating expenses, \n  32 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nSame Station Operating Income, Digital Media Operating Income, and Publishing Operating Income, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our core operating results, and thus, are appropriate to enhance the overall understanding of our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide management and investors a more complete understanding of our underlying operational results, trends and performance. \nThe performance of a radio broadcasting company is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate SOI. We define SOI as net broadcast revenue\nless broadcast operating expenses. Accordingly, changes in net broadcast revenue and broadcast operating expenses, as explained above, have a direct impact on changes in SOI. SOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nSOI should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of GAAP. We believe that SOI is a useful non-GAAP financial measure to investors when\nconsidered in conjunction with operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to SOI), because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation\nmethodologies for companies in the media, entertainment and communications industries. SOI is commonly used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide comparisons between broadcasting groups. We use SOI as one of the key\nmeasures of operating efficiency and profitability, including our internal reviews for potential impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets and our internal reviews to approve capital expenditures. SOI does not purport to represent cash\nprovided by operating activities. Our statement of cash flows presents our cash activity in accordance with GAAP and our income statement presents our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of SOI is not necessarily\ncomparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  We define Same Station net broadcast revenue as net broadcast revenue from our radio\nstations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We define Same Station broadcast operating expenses as broadcast operating expenses\nfrom our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income includes those stations we own or operate\nin the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income for a full calendar year is calculated as the sum of the Same Station-results for each of the four\nquarters of that year. We use Same Station Operating Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluations and\nmanagement of the business. We believe that Same Station Operating Income provides a meaningful comparison of period over period performance of our core broadcast operations as this measure excludes the impact of new stations, the impact of stations\nwe no longer own or operate, and the impact of stations operating under a new programming format. Our presentation of Same Station Operating Income is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable\nfinancial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of Same Station net broadcast revenue, Same Station broadcast operating expenses and Same Station Operating Income is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures\nreported by other companies.  We apply a similar methodology to our digital media and publishing group. Digital Media Operating Income is defined as net\ndigital media revenue less digital media operating expenses. Publishing Operating Loss is defined as net publishing revenue less publishing operating expenses. Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are not measures of\nperformance in accordance with GAAP. Our presentations of these non-GAAP financial performance measures are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to our operating results reported in accordance\nwith GAAP. We believe that Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are useful non-GAAP financial measures to investors, when considered in conjunction with operating income (the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measure), because they are comparable to those used to measure performance of our broadcasting entities. We use this analysis as one of the key measures of operating efficiency, profitability and in our internal\nreviews for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets and our internal reviews to approve capital expenditures. This measurement does not purport to represent cash \n  33 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nprovided by operating activities. Our statement of cash flows presents our cash activity in accordance with GAAP and our income statement presents our financial performance in accordance with\nGAAP. Our definitions of Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Loss are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. \nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before gains or losses on the\ndisposition of assets, before changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, before gains on bargain purchases, before the change in fair value of interest rate swaps, before\nimpairments, before net miscellaneous income and expenses, before loss on early retirement of debt, before (gain) loss from discontinued operations and before non-cash compensation expense. EBITDA and Adjusted\nEBITDA are commonly used by the broadcast and media industry as important measures of performance and are used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide meaningful comparisons between broadcasters. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nare not measures of liquidity or of performance in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for or superior to our results of operations and financial condition presented in accordance with GAAP. Our\ndefinitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  For all non-GAAP financial measures, investors should consider the limitations associated with these metrics, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. \nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: \nIn the tables below, we present a reconciliation of net broadcast revenue, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Same Station net broadcast revenue, and\nbroadcast operating expenses, the most comparable GAAP measure to Same Station broadcast operating expense. We show our calculation of SOI and Same Station Operating Income, which is reconciled from net income, the most comparable GAAP measure in\nthe table following our calculation of Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Loss. Our presentation of these non-GAAP measures are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to the\nmost directly comparable measures reported in accordance with GAAP.

The decline includes $2.7 million of revenue generated in 2019 from stations sold during that year, of which $2.3 million was local programming and $0.4 million was\nnational programming. Additionally, approximately $1.2 million of the decline was due to local sports programming that was cancelled during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and $0.4 million from\nearly payments discounts offered to a limited number of national programmers during 2020. The remainder of the decline was due to certain programmers discontinuing their ministry efforts and an increase in competition from other broadcasters and\nfrom podcasts that resulted in a lower number of programs and lower rates. \n  37 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAdvertising revenue, net of agency commissions, declined by $13.5 million, $15.9 million net of\npolitical, due to a $13.3 million decline in local advertising net of political and a $2.6 million decline in national advertising revenue net of political. Local advertising, net of political, declined by $5.6 million on our\nContemporary Christian Music format radio stations, $3.0 million on our Christian Teaching and Talk format radio stations, $2.4 million on our News Talk format radio stations, and $2.1 million on other format stations. These declines\nwere due to lower spot rates charged to compete with other broadcasters, primarily in the Dallas, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets, where competition for advertising buys was strong. An additional $1.4 million of the decline resulted from\nstations sold during 2019. The remainder of the decline was attributable to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with many advertisers reducing or ceasing to advertise due to stay-at-home orders and limited capacity orders that temporarily closed their businesses. \nStation digital revenue, or local digital revenue generated from our radio stations and networks, increased by $9.6 million due to the growth of digital\nproduct offerings through Salem Surround, our national multimedia digital advertising agency providing digital marketing services to our customers. Our product offerings include social media campaigns, search engine optimization, retargeted\nadvertising and other services intended to increase our market share as advertising dollars shift away from pure broadcast to include digital and digital technologies. In addition, we recently launched SalemNOW, an\non-demand pay-per-view video steaming platform that contributed $4.4 million of the $9.6 million growth in revenue.\nThere were no significant changes in digital rates as compared to the prior year.  Declines in infomercial revenue were due to a reduction in the number\nof infomercials aired with no significant changes in rates as compared to the prior year. The placement of infomercials can vary significantly from one period to another due to the number of time slots available and the degree to which the\ninfomercial content is considered to be of interest to our audience.  Network revenue, net of digital, increased by $0.3 million due to a\n$1.7 million decline in national advertising revenue offset by a $2.0 million increase in political advertising.  Other revenue declined by\n$3.5 million due to a $2.7 million decrease in event revenue from the cancellation of live events due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a $0.7 million decrease in listener purchase program revenue from\nlower listener participation. Event revenue varies from period to period based on the nature and timing of events, audience demand, and in some cases, the weather, which can affect attendance. We began offering virtual events during 2020 that may\ncontinue as conditions warrant.  On a Same Station basis, net broadcast revenue decreased $11.0 million, which reflects these items net of the impact\nof stations acquired, disposed of, or with format changes.

The net increase from Townhall Media includes\n$0.6 million from our March 2019 acquisition of pjmedia.com and increases from political elections and national events. Declines in national digital advertising from SWN are attributable to a loss of advertisers who moved advertising spending\nto digital programmatic advertisers, such as Facebook and Google, and to a loss of advertisers who reduced or eliminated advertising. We continue to acquire, develop and promote the use of mobile applications, particularly for our Christian mobile\napplications, to reduce our dependency on page views from digital programmatic advertisers. Because mobile page views carry fewer advertisements and tend to have shorter site visits as compared to desktop, our growth in mobile page views exceeds our\ngrowth in revenue from the mobile applications.  Digital streaming revenue decreased $0.4 million based on lower demand for content available from\nour Christian websites. There were no significant changes in sales volume or rates as compared to the prior year.  Digital subscription revenue increased\n$1.2 million, including a $1.0 million increase from Townhall VIP, a new subscription service from Townhall Media, $0.2 million from InvesmentHouse.com that was acquired in June 2019, and a $0.2 million net increase in the number\nof subscribers to newsletters from Eagle Financial Publications, offset by a $0.2 million decrease from Christianjobs.com and Churchstaffing.com within SWN. \nDigital download revenue increased by $0.2 million from our church product websites, WorshipHouseMedia.com and SermonSpiceTM.com. There were no significant changes in rates as compared to the prior year.  E-commerce revenue decreased by $0.3 million including a $0.4 million decrease from the sale of Newport Natural Health on March 21, 2019 that was offset with a $0.1 million increase from Eagle\nFinancial Publications. There were no significant changes in rates as compared to the prior year.  Other revenue includes revenue sharing arrangements for\nmobile applications and mail list rentals. We recognized revenue of $0.2 million in 2019 related to transfer services provided to the buyer of Newport Natural Health. There were no changes in volume or rates as compared to the prior year. \nNet Publishing Revenue   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n2019\n \n  \n2020\n \n  \nChange $\n \n \nChange %\n \n \n2019\n \n \n2020\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n \n \n \n \n% of Total Net Revenue\n \n\n Net Publishing Revenue\n  \n$\n21,394\n \n  \n$\n18,519\n \n  \n$\n(2,875\n) \n \n \n(13.4\n)% \n \n \n8.4\n% \n \n \n7.8\n% \n\n  39 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe following table shows the dollar amount and percentage of net publishing revenue for each publishing\nrevenue source.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n2019\n \n \n2020\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Book Sales\n  \n$\n17,418\n \n  \n \n81.4\n% \n \n$\n13,707\n \n  \n \n74.0\n% \n\n Estimated Sales Returns & Allowances\n  \n \n(5,739\n) \n  \n \n(26.8\n) \n \n \n(4,479\n) \n  \n \n(24.2\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Net Book Sales\n  \n \n11,679\n \n  \n \n54.6\n \n \n \n9,228\n \n  \n \n49.8\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n E-Book Sales\n  \n \n1,428\n \n  \n \n6.7\n \n \n \n1,605\n \n  \n \n8.7\n \n\n Self-Publishing Fees\n  \n \n5,474\n \n  \n \n25.6\n \n \n \n5,424\n \n  \n \n29.3\n \n\n Print Magazine Subscriptions\n  \n \n763\n \n  \n \n3.6\n \n \n \n680\n \n  \n \n3.7\n \n\n Print Magazine Advertisements\n  \n \n609\n \n  \n \n2.8\n \n \n \n353\n \n  \n \n1.9\n \n\n Digital Advertising\n  \n \n405\n \n  \n \n1.9\n \n \n \n415\n \n  \n \n2.2\n \n\n Other Revenue\n  \n \n1,036\n \n  \n \n4.8\n \n \n \n814\n \n  \n \n4.4\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Net Publishing Revenue\n  \n$\n21,394\n \n  \n \n100.0\n% \n \n$\n18,519\n \n  \n \n100.0\n% \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n Net book sales declined by $2.5 million due to a lower volume of sales from Regnery® Publishing and Salem Author Services. Regnery® Publishing book sales reflect an 2% decrease in the average price per unit sold and a 22%\ndecrease in volume due to a majority of book stores in the country being closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Amazon’s decision to prioritize the shipment of essential products over the shipment of\nbooks. Revenue from book sales through Regnery® Publishing are directly attributable to the number of titles released each period and the composite mix of titles available. Revenue varies\nsignificantly from period to period based on the book release date and the number of titles that achieve placement on bestseller lists, which can increase awareness and demand for the book. The decrease of $1.3 million to the estimated sales\nreturns and allowances reflects the lower number of print books sold through Regnery® Publishing. The decline in book sales from Salem Author Services was due to authors choosing not to buy\nbooks because they could not be promoted at live events. There were no significant changes in sale prices as compared to the prior year.  Regnery® Publishing e-book sales increased by $0.2 million with a 12% decrease in sales volume offset by a 27% increase in the average price per unit sold from\nsales incentives. E-book sales can also vary based on the composite mix of titles released and available in each period. Revenue varies significantly based on the book release date and the number of titles\nthat achieve placement on bestseller lists, which can increase awareness and demand for the book.  Self-publishing fees decreased $0.4 million due a\ndecline in the number of authors with rates charged that were comparable to the prior year.  Declines in print magazine subscription revenue and\nadvertising revenue reflect lower consumer demand and distribution levels. There were no significant changes in rates over the prior year.  Digital\nadverting revenue from Regnery® Publishing websites was consistent with the prior year with no changes in volume or rates. \nOther revenue includes change fees, video trailers, and subright revenue for foreign translation and audio books for original published titles from Regnery® Publishing. Subright revenue declined $0.2 million due to lower demand. \n  40 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBroadcast Operating Expenses \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n2019\n \n  \n2020\n \n  \nChange $\n \n \nChange %\n \n \n2019\n \n \n2020\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n \n \n \n \n% of Total Net Revenue\n \n\n Broadcast Operating Expenses\n  \n$\n149,439\n \n  \n$\n140,942\n \n  \n$\n(8,497\n) \n \n \n(5.7\n)% \n \n \n58.9\n% \n \n \n59.7\n% \n\n Same Station Broadcast Operating Expenses\n  \n$\n141,189\n \n  \n$\n137,774\n \n  \n$\n(3,415\n) \n \n \n(2.4\n)% \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Broadcast operating expenses decreased by $8.5 million including $11.0 million from cost reduction initiatives and\n$5.1 million from stations sold during 2019 that were offset by a $7.5 million increase in costs from Salem Surround and SalemNOW. We implemented several cost cutting measures in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in a $3.4 million reduction in employee-related costs from temporary pay cuts, layoffs and furloughs, a $2.2 million decline in event costs, a $2.0 million decline in\nadvertising, a $1.1 million decline in travel and entertainment, and a $0.3 million decline in lease expense. The decrease also reflects a $3.4 million decline in commissions consistent with lower revenue, a $0.4 million decline\nin non-cash stock-based compensation associated with restricted stock awards, and a $0.3 million decline in music license fees that was partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in bad debt expense,\nincluding an additional reserve of $1.1 million recorded at March 31, 2020 due to the impact on collections of the economic uncertainties from the COVID-19 pandemic, a $0.5 million increase in\nlegal fees and a $0.5 million increase in insurance and software maintenance fees.  On a same-station basis, broadcast operating expenses decreased\nby $3.4 million. The decrease in broadcast operating expenses on a Same Station basis reflects the above described items net of the impact of start-up costs associated with station acquisitions, format\nchanges and station dispositions.

Actual results are compared to the estimates and probabilities of achievement used in our\nforecasts. Should actual results of the acquired business increase or decrease as compared to our estimates and assumptions, the estimated fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration liability will\nincrease or decrease, up to the contracted limit, as applicable. Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration may materially impact and cause volatility in our operating\nresults.  At December 31, 2020, no estimated contingent earn-out consideration was outstanding compared to\n$19,000 at December 31, 2019. We recorded a net decrease to our estimated contingent earn-out liabilities of $12,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net decrease of $41,000 during\nthe prior year. Changes in our estimates of the contingent earn-out reflect the volatility of projected revenue growth, page views and session time.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES \nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared\nin accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \nWe believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates are critical accounting policies that affect the preparation of our\nConsolidated Financial Statements:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n going concern evaluations; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n revenue recognition;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n asset impairments, including broadcasting licenses, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets;\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n probabilities associated with the potential for contingent earn-out\nconsideration;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n fair value measurements; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n contingency reserves;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n allowance for doubtful accounts; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n sales returns and allowances; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n barter transactions;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n inventory reserves;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n reserves for royalty advances; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n fair value of equity awards; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n self-insurance reserves; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n estimated lives for tangible and intangible assets; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n assessment of contract-based factors, asset-based factors, entity-based factors and market-based factors to\ndetermine the lease term impacting Right-Of-Use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n determining the Incremental Borrowing Rate (“IBR”) for calculating ROU assets and lease liabilities;\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n income tax valuation allowances; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n uncertain tax positions. \n  46 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThese estimates require the use of judgment as future events and the effect of these events cannot be\npredicted with certainty. The estimates will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired and as more information is obtained. We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and we may consult outside experts\nto assist as considered necessary.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to create significant uncertainty and\ndisruption in the global economy and financial markets. It is reasonably possible that these uncertainties could materially impact our estimates related to, but not limited to, revenue recognition, broadcast licenses, goodwill and income taxes. As a\nresult, many of our estimates and assumptions require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. Our estimates may change as new events occur and additional information emerges, and such changes are recognized or\ndisclosed in our consolidated financial statements.  We believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates are critical\naccounting policies that affect the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Going Concern \nManagement is responsible for evaluating conditions or events as related to uncertainties that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going\nconcern and to provide related footnote disclosures, as applicable. Management’s estimates and assumptions, used in the evaluation of our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date our financial statements\nare issued, are based on the facts and circumstances at such date and are subject to a material and high level of subjectivity and uncertainty due to the matters themselves being uncertain and subject to modification. The effect of any individual or\naggregate changes in the estimates and assumptions, or the facts and circumstances, could be material to the financial statements.  Given the decreases in\nrevenue caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed a variety of factors, including media industry forecasts, expected operating results, forecasted net cash flows from operations, future obligations and\nliquidity, and capital expenditure commitments. We concluded that the potential that we could incur a considerable decrease in operating income and the resulting impact on our ability to fund interest payments on our debt, were probable conditions\nwhich gave rise to a need for an assessment of whether substantial doubt existed of our ability to continue as a going concern.  We reforecast our\nanticipated results extending through March 2022. Our reforecast includes the impact of certain cost-cutting measures associated with reductions in staffing, reductions in commissions and royalty expenses based on lower revenue forecasts, reductions\nin travel and entertainment expenses due to stay-at-home mandates, reductions in event costs, company-wide pay cuts, furloughs of certain employees, and the temporary\nsuspension of the company 401(k) match. Based on our current assessment, we believe that we have the ability to meet our obligations as they come due for one year from the issuance of the financial statements. \nRevenue Recognition  Significant management\njudgments and estimates must be made in connection with determining the amount of revenue to be recognized in any accounting period. We must assess the promises within each sales contract to determine if they are distinct performance obligations.\nOnce the performance obligation(s) are determined, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligation(s) based on a relative standalone selling price basis. If a sales contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire\ntransaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price.\nIf the stand-alone selling price is not determinable, an estimate is used.  We make significant estimates related to variable consideration at the point\nof sale, including estimates for refunds and product returns. Under ASC Topic 606, estimates of variable consideration are to be recognized \n  47 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nbefore contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances, including when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of any estimated cumulative revenue will not occur. \nA growing source of revenue is generated from digital product offerings, which allow for enhanced audience interaction and participation, and integrated\ndigital advertising solutions. When offering digital products, another party may be involved in providing the goods or services that make up a performance obligation to the customer. These include the use of third-party websites for social media\ncampaigns. We must evaluate if we are the principal or agent in order to determine if revenue should be reported gross as principal or net as agent. In this evaluation, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they\nare transferred to our customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price. The determination of whether we control a specified good or service\nimmediately prior to the good or service being transferred requires us to make reasonable judgments on the nature of each agreement. We have determined that we are acting as principal when we manage all aspects of a social media campaign, including\nreviewing and approving target audiences, monitoring actual results and making modifications as needed and when we are responsible for delivering campaign results to our customers regardless of the use of a third-party or parties. \nTrade and Barter Transactions  In broadcasting,\ntrade or barter agreements are commonly used to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services. We may enter barter agreements to exchange airtime or digital advertising for goods or services that can be used in our\nbusiness or that can be sold to our audience under Listener Purchase Programs. The terms of these barter agreements permit us to preempt the barter airtime or digital campaign in favor of customers who purchase the airtime or digital campaign for\ncash. The value of these non-cash exchanges is included in revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the goods or services we receive. Each transaction must be reviewed to determine that the products,\nsupplies and/or services we receive have economic substance, or value to us. We record barter operating expenses upon receipt and usage of the products, supplies and services, as applicable. We record barter revenue as advertising spots or digital\ncampaigns are delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Barter revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which\ncase, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency.  Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \nApproximately 65% of our total assets at December 31, 2020 consisted of indefinite-lived intangible assets including broadcast licenses and goodwill.\nThese indefinite-lived intangible assets originated from acquisitions in which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcast licenses and goodwill. We do not amortize indefinite-lived intangible assets, but rather test for\nimpairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. We perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, which coincides with our budget and planning process for the\nupcoming year.  Impairment testing requires an estimate of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. We believe that these estimates of\nfair value are critical accounting estimates as the value is significant in relation to our total assets and the estimates incorporate variables and assumptions based on our experiences and judgment about our future operating performance. Fair value\nmeasurements use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value, including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the\nassumptions and estimates used in our estimates, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. The unobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures as\nLevel 3 inputs discussed in Note 13 of our Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  The first step of our impairment testing is to perform a\nqualitative assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. This qualitative assessment requires significant judgment \n  48 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nwhen considering the events and circumstances that may affect the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. These events and circumstances are not all-inclusive and are not by themselves indicators of impairment. We consider external and internal factors when reviewing the following events and circumstances, which are presented in the order of what we believe\nto be the strongest to weakest indicators of impairment:   \n\n\n \n(1)\n the difference between any recent fair value calculations and the carrying value; \n \n\n\n \n(2)\n financial performance, such as station operating income, including performance as compared to projected results\nused in prior estimates of fair value;   \n\n\n \n(3)\n macroeconomic economic conditions, including limitations on accessing capital that could affect the discount\nrates used in prior estimates of fair value;   \n\n\n \n(4)\n industry and market considerations such as a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in\ndemand, competition, or other economic factors;   \n\n\n \n(5)\n operating cost factors, such as increases in labor, that could have a negative effect on future expected\nearnings and cash flows;   \n\n\n \n(6)\n legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors; \n \n\n\n \n(7)\n other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management or customers; and \n \n\n\n \n(8)\n any changes to the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. \nIf it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, we are required to perform a second step to preparing a quantitative analysis to estimate the fair or\nenterprise value of the assets. We did not find reconciliation to our current market capitalization meaningful in the determination of our enterprise value given current factors that impact our market capitalization, including but not limited to:\nlimited trading volume, the impact of our publishing segment operating losses and the significant voting control of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We engage an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm to assist us with\ndetermining the enterprise value as part of our quantitative review.  If the results of our quantitative analysis indicate that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. \nWe believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, however, these\nestimates and assumptions are highly judgmental in nature. Actual results can be materially different from estimates and assumptions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or by us, or if events occur or\ncircumstances change that would reduce the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets below the amounts reflected on our balance sheet, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. \nSensitivity of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \nWhen estimating the fair value of broadcast licenses and goodwill, we make assumptions regarding future revenue growth rates, operating cash flow margins and\ndiscount rates. These assumptions require substantial judgment that may differ materially from actual results. The following sensitivity analysis shows the incremental impact and the hypothetical non-cash\nimpairment charge that would have result if our estimates were to change by 100 basis points as of the annual testing period in the fourth quarter of 2020:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nSensitivity Analysis (1)\n \n\n \n  \nIncrease in Risk-Adjusted Discount Rate\n \n  \nDecrease in OperatingProfit Margins\n \n  \nDecrease in Long-TermRevenue Growth Rates\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Incremental broadcast licenses impairment\n  \n$\n13,302\n \n  \n$\n—  \n \n  \n$\n4,132\n \n\n Incremental goodwill impairment\n  \n \n862\n \n  \n \n648\n \n  \n \n317\n \n\n  49 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n(1)\n Each assumption used in the sensitivity analysis is independent of the other assumptions.\n The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) developed based on data from same or\nsimilar industry participants and publicly available market data as of the measurement date. The same discount rate was used in each of our broadcast markets. The discount rate applied to our digital media and publishing entities was higher given\nthe perceived additional risks associated with the cash flows of these businesses.  Operating profit margin is defined as operating income before\ninterest, depreciation, amortization, income tax and corporate allocation charges divided by net revenue. For the fair value analysis, the projections of operating profit margin that are used are based upon industry expectations. These margin\nprojections are not specific to the performance of our radio stations or segments in a market but are predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to a typical\ncompetitor. If actual future margins are lower than our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.  For\nthe goodwill fair value analysis, the projections of operating margin for each broadcast market and each entity are based on our historical performance. If the future outlook for the broadcast, digital or publishing industry growth declines by more\nthan our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.  Long-term revenue growth rates are determined from\npublicly available information on industry expectations rather than our own estimates, which could differ. Long-term revenue growth rates can vary for each of our broadcast markets. Using industry expectations, each broadcast market, digital and\npublishing entity’s revenue was forecasted over a ten-year projection period to reflect the projected long-term growth rate. If the future outlook for the broadcast, digital or publishing industry growth\ndeclines by more than our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.  Business Acquisitions\n We account for business acquisitions in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting as specified in FASB ASC Topic 805 Business\nCombinations. The total acquisition consideration is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the transaction. Estimates of the fair value include discounted estimated cash flows\nto be generated by the assets and their expected useful lives based on historical experience, market trends and any synergies believed to be achieved from the acquisition. The excess of consideration paid over the estimated fair values of the net\nassets acquired is recorded as goodwill and any excess of fair value of the net assets acquired over the consideration paid is recorded as a gain on bargain purchase. Prior to recording a gain, the acquiring entity must reassess whether all acquired\nassets and assumed liabilities have been identified and recognized and perform re-measurements to verify that the consideration paid, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed have been properly valued. \nAcquisitions may include contingent earn-out consideration, the fair value of which is estimated as of the acquisition\ndate as the present value of the expected contingent payments as determined using weighted probabilities of the payment amounts.  A majority of our radio\nstation acquisitions have consisted primarily of the FCC licenses to broadcast in a particular market. We often do not acquire the existing format, or we change the format upon acquisition when we find it beneficial. As a result, a substantial\nportion of the purchase price for the assets of a radio station is allocated to the broadcast license. Under ASU 2017-01, a fewer number of our radio station acquisitions qualify as business acquisitions and\ninstead are accounted for as asset purchases. Asset purchases are recognized based on their cost to acquire, including transaction costs. The cost to acquire an asset group is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair\nvalue with no goodwill recognized. \n  50 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe may retain a third-party appraiser to estimate the fair value of the acquired net assets as of the\nacquisition date. As part of the valuation and appraisal process, the third-party appraiser prepares a report assigning estimated fair values to the various asset categories in our financial statements. These fair value estimates are subjective in\nnature and require careful consideration and judgment. Management reviews the third-party reports for reasonableness of the assigned values. We believe that the purchase price allocations represent the appropriate estimated fair value of the assets\nacquired and we have not had to modify our purchase price allocations.  We estimate the economic life of each tangible and intangible asset acquired to\ndetermine the period of time in which the asset should be depreciated or amortized. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the economic life of each asset. We consider our own experience with similar assets, industry trends,\nmarket conditions and the age of the property at the time of our acquisition to estimate the economic life of each asset. If the financial condition of the assets were to deteriorate, the resulting change in life or impairment of the asset could\ncause a material impact and volatility in our operating results. To date, we have not experienced changes in the economic life established for each major category of our assets. \nContingent Earn-Out Consideration \nOur acquisitions often include contingent earn-out consideration as part of the purchase price. The fair value of the\ncontingent earn-out consideration is estimated as of the acquisition date based on the present value of the contingent payments expected to be made using a weighted probability of possible payments. The\nunobservable inputs used in the determination of the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration include our own assumptions about the likelihood of payment based on the established benchmarks and\ndiscount rates based on our internal rate of return analysis. The fair value measurements include inputs that are Level 3 measurement as discussed in Note 13 in the notes of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 in this\nannual report.  We review the probabilities of possible future payments to the estimated fair value of any contingent\nearn-out consideration on a quarterly basis over the earn-out period. Actual results are compared to the estimates and probabilities of achievement used in our\nforecasts. Should actual results increase or decrease as compared to the assumption used in our analysis, the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration obligations will increase or decrease, up to\nthe contracted limit, as applicable. Changes in the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration could cause a material impact and volatility in our operating results. The changes in our estimates\nreflect volatility from variables, such as revenue growth, page views and session time  We believe that we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions\nto calculate the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration however, these estimates and assumptions are highly judgmental in nature. Actual results can be materially different from estimates\nand assumptions.  Fair Value Measurements \nFASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures established a single definition of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles\nand requires expanded disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. The provision applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This includes applying the fair value concept to\n(i) nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in business combinations; (ii) reporting units or nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in conjunction with goodwill impairment testing;\n(iii) other nonfinancial assets measured at fair value in conjunction with impairment assessments; and (iv) asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value. \nThe fair value provisions include guidance on how to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities in the current economic environment and reemphasize\nthat the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price. If \n  51 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nwe were to conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities, quoted market values may not\nbe representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. \nThe degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Pricing\nobservability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market, and the characteristics specific to the transaction. Financial instruments with readily available\nactive quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments\nrarely traded or not quoted will generally have less (or no) pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value.  FASB\nASC Topic 820 established a hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring fair value. This framework defined three levels of inputs to the fair value measurement process and requires that\neach fair value measurement be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three broad levels of inputs defined by the FASB ASC Topic 820 hierarchy are as\nfollows:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Level 1 Inputs—quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that\nthe reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Level 2 Inputs—inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Level 3 Inputs—unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. These unobservable inputs reflect the\nentity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (which might include the reporting entity’s\nown data).  We believe that we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our financial\nassets as discussed in Note 13 in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this annual report.  Contingency\nReserves  In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits, arbitration and other claims that are complex\nin nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or the financial impact with respect to these matters. Certain of these proceedings are\ndiscussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, contained in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  We record contingency reserves to the extent we\nconclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. The establishment of the reserve is based on a review of all relevant factors, the advice of legal counsel, and the\nsubjective judgment of management. The reserves we have recorded to date have not been material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our\nreserves are accurately reflected.  While we believe that the final resolution of any known matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, it is \n  52 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\npossible that we could incur additional losses. We maintain insurance that may provide coverage for such matters. Future claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could have a material\nadverse effect upon our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including losses due to costly litigation and losses due to matters that require significant amounts of management time that can result in the diversion of\nsignificant operational resources.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts \nWe evaluate the balance reserved in our allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis based on our historical collection experience, the age of the\nreceivables, specific customer information and current economic conditions. We increased our reserve percentages during 2020 based on the adverse economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and\nthe expected impact on the ability of our customers to make payments. Past due balances are generally not written-off until all collection efforts have been unsuccessful, including use of a collection agency.\nA considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current creditworthiness of each customer. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,\nresulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe\nthat our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.  Sales Returns and Allowances \nWe provide for estimated returns for products sold with the right of return, primarily book sales associated with Regnery® Publishing and nutritional products sold through our wellness division. We record an estimate of these product returns as a reduction of revenue in the period of the sale. Our estimates are based\nupon historical sales returns, the amount of current period sales, economic trends and any changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. We regularly monitor actual performance to estimated return rates and make adjustments as\nnecessary. Estimated return rates utilized for establishing estimated returns reserves have approximated actual returns experience. However, actual returns may differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from these estimates if factors\nsuch as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and/or the market. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not\nhistorically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected. \nInventory Reserves  Inventories consist of\npublished books from Regnery® Publishing. Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value as determined on a First-In First-Out cost method. We review historical data and our own experiences to estimate the fair value of inventory on hand. Our analysis includes reviewing actual sales returns, allowance estimates, royalty reserves,\noverall economic conditions and demand for each title. We record a provision to expense the balance of unsold inventory that we believe to be unrecoverable. We regularly monitor actual performance to our estimates and make adjustments as necessary.\nEstimated inventory reserves may be adjusted, either favorably or unfavorably, if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the\ncustomer and/or the market. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves\nare accurately reflected.  Reserves for Royalty Advances \nRoyalties are paid in advance to book authors and capitalized as prepaid assets. Royalties are expensed as the related book revenue is earned or when we\ndetermine that future recovery of the royalty is not likely. We review \n  53 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nhistorical data associated with royalty advances, earnings and recoverability based on actual results of Regnery® Publishing.\nHistorically, the longer the unearned portion of an advance remains outstanding, the less likely it is that we will recover the advance through sales of the book. We apply this historical experience to outstanding royalty advances to estimate the\nlikelihood of recovery. A provision is established to expense the balance of any unearned advance which we believe is not recoverable. Our analysis also considers other discrete factors, such as death of an author, any decision to not pursue\npublication of a title, poor market demand and other relevant factors. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and\nassumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.  Fair Value of Equity Awards \nWe account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation. We record equity awards with\nstock-based compensation measured at the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We determine the fair value of each award using the Black-Scholes valuation model that requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected\nstock price volatility and the expected term of the award granted. The exercise price for each award is equal to or greater than the closing market price of Salem Media Group, Inc. common stock as of the date of the award. We use the straight-line\nattribution method to recognize share-based compensation costs over the expected service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of the award, deferred tax assets for awards with multiple vesting dates are\neliminated for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period was a separate award. We have not modified our estimates or assumptions used\nin our valuation model. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our stock-based compensation is accurately reflected in our results of operations. \nPartial Self-Insurance on Employee Health Plan  We\nprovide health insurance benefits to eligible employees under a self-insured plan whereby we pay actual medical claims subject to certain stop loss limits. We record self-insurance liabilities based on actual claims filed and an estimate of those\nclaims incurred but not reported. Our estimates are based on historical data and probabilities. Any projection of losses concerning our liability is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable\nexternal factors such as future inflation rates, changes in severity, benefit level changes, medical costs and claim settlement patterns. Should the actual amount of claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated, we may adjust our future\nreserves. Our self-insurance liability was $0.5 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant\nlosses from changes in our estimates.  Leases \nWe account for leases under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”). We consider all relevant facts and\ncircumstances to determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception. Our analysis includes whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. This\nconsideration involves judgment with respect to whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of the identified asset. \nLease Term – Impact on Right-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities\n The lease term can materially impact the value of the Right-of-Use\n(“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities recorded on our balance sheet as required under ASC 842. We calculate the term for each lease agreement to include the noncancellable period specified in the agreement together with (1) the periods\ncovered by options to extend the \n  54 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nlease if we are reasonably certain to exercise that option, (2) periods covered by an option to terminate if we are reasonably certain not to exercise that option and (3) period covered\nby an option to extend (or not terminate) if controlled by the lessor. The assessment of whether we are reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease requires significant judgement surrounding contract-based factors, asset-based\nfactors, entity-based factors and market-based factors. These factors, detailed below, are evaluated based on the facts and circumstances at the time we enter a lease agreement. \nContract-Based Factors:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n The existence of a bargain renewal option \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n The existence of contingent or variable payments \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n The nature and terms of renewal or termination options \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n The costs the lessee would incur to restore the asset before returning it to the lessor \nAsset-Based Factors:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n The existence of significant lessee-installed leasehold improvements that would still have economic value when\nthe option becomes exercisable   \n\n\n \n•\n \n The physical location of the asset \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n The costs that would be incurred to replace or find an alternative asset \nEntity-Based Factors:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Historical practice   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Management’s intent \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Common industry practice \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n The financial impact on the entity of extending or terminating the lease \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n The importance of the leased asset to the entity’s operations \nMarket-Based Factors:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Market rental or purchase rates for comparable assets \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Potential implications of local regulations and statutory requirements \nWe have not modified our estimate methodology since adopting ASC 842 on January 1, 2019. \nIncremental Borrowing Rate  ROU assets and related\nlease liabilities recorded under ASC 842 are calculated based on the present value of the lease payments using (1) the rate implicit in the lease or (2) the lessee’s Incremental Borrowing Rate (“IBR”). IBR is defined as the\nrate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we estimate the IBR\napplicable to Salem using significant judgement and estimates, including the estimated value of the underlying leased asset, and the following available evidence: \nThe credit history of Salem Media Group \nOur most recent credit facility consists of 6.75% Senior Secured Notes and a revolving ABL Facility. As of each month end, the weighted average\ninterest rate on outstanding debt is calculated. \n  55 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe credit worthiness of Salem Media Group \nWe review our credit ratings from third parties, including Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. Both ratings were downgraded\nduring 2020 to poor quality with very high credit risk.  Class of the underlying asset and the remaining term of the arrangement \nWe use a portfolio approach applying a single IBR to all leases with reasonably similar characteristics, including the remaining lease term,\nthe underlying assets and the economic environment. We group leases according to the nature of leased asset and the lease term. We have six main categories of leases, (1) Buildings, (2) Equipment, (3) Land, (4) Other (Parking Facilities),\n(5) Towers and (6) Vehicles.  We consider vehicles to have a higher risk for collateral that is mitigated by the shorter term of the\nlease that would typically range from three to five years. We consider building and towers to have a higher risk based on (1) the longer lease term of up to thirty years and (2) a higher outstanding balance that is mitigated by the lower\nrisk that the collateralized asset would lose significant value.  The debt incurred under the lease liability as compared to amounts that\nwould be borrowed  We review the cost to finance comparable amounts under our ABL Facility and based on the current market environment as\nderived from available economic data.  We referred to the Bloomberg Single B Rated Communications Yield Curve (unsecured) and considered\nadjustments for industry risk factors and the estimated value of the underlying leased asset to be collateral for the debt incurred.  From these data\npoints, we develop a matrix to estimate the IBR for each lease class. We review the IBR estimates on a quarterly basis and update as necessary. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not recognized significant changes in our\nestimates.  Impairment of ROU Assets  ROU assets from\noperating and finance leases are subject to the impairment guidance in ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment consistent with other long-lived nonfinancial assets. ROU assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present.\n ROU assets are tested for impairment individually or as part of an asset group if the cash flows related to the ROU asset are not independent from the\ncash flows of other assets and liabilities. An asset group is the unit of accounting for long-lived assets to be held and used, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other\ngroups of assets and liabilities.  After a careful analysis of the guidance, we concluded that the appropriate unit of accounting for testing ROU assets\nfor impairment is the broadcast market cluster level for radio station operations and the entity or division level for digital media entities, publishing entities and networks. Corporate ROU assets are tested on a consolidated level with\nconsideration given to all cash flows of the company as corporate functions do not generate cash flows and are funded by revenue-producing activities at lower levels of the entity. \nASC 360 requires three steps to identify, recognize and measure the impairment of a long-lived asset (asset group) to be held and used: \nStep 1—Consider whether Indicators of Impairment are Present \nAs detailed in ASC\n360-10-35-21, the following are examples of impairment indicators: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n A significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset (asset group) \n  56 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n•\n \n A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or\nin its physical condition   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a\nlong-lived asset (asset group), including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator   \n\n\n \n•\n \n An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or\nconstruction of a long-lived asset (asset group)   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a\nprojection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset (asset group)   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise\ndisposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The term more likely than not refers to a level of likelihood that is more than 50 percent. \nOther indicators should be considered if we believe that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. \nStep 2—Test for Recoverability \nIf indicators of impairment are present, we are required to perform a recoverability test comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash\nflows attributable to the long-lived asset or asset group in question to the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group.  ASC\n360 does not specifically address how operating lease liabilities and future cash outflows for lease payments should be considered in the recoverability test. Under ASC 360, financial liabilities, or long-term debt, generally are excluded from an\nasset group while operating liabilities, such as accounts payable, generally are included. ASC 842 characterizes operating lease liabilities as operating liabilities. Because operating lease liabilities may be viewed as having attributes of finance\nliabilities as well as operating liabilities, it is generally acceptable for a lessee to either include or exclude operating lease liabilities from an asset group when testing whether the carrying amount of an asset group is recoverable provided the\napproach is applied consistently for all operating leases and when performing Steps 2 and 3 of the impairment model in ASC 360.  In cases\nwhere we have received lease incentives, including operating lease liabilities in an asset group may result in the long-lived asset or asset group having a zero or negative carrying amount because the incentives reduce our ROU assets. We elected to\nexclude operating lease liabilities from the carrying amount of the asset group such that we test ROU assets for operating leases in the same manner that we test ROU assets for financing leases. \nUndiscounted Future Cash Flows \nThe undiscounted future cash flows in Step 2 are based on our own assumptions rather than a market participant. If an election is made to\nexclude operating lease liabilities from the asset or asset group, all future cash lease payments for the lease should also be excluded. The standard requires lessees to exclude certain variable lease payments from lease payments and, therefore,\nfrom the measurement of a lessee’s lease liabilities. Because these variable payments do not reduce the lease liability, we include the variable payments we expect to make in our estimate of the undiscounted cash flows in the recoverability\ntest (Step 2) using a probability-weighted approach.  Step 3—Measurement of an Impairment Loss \nIf the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset (asset group), we are\nrequired to estimate the fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group and \n  57 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nrecognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value. We elected to exclude operating lease liabilities from the estimated\nfair value, consistent with the recoverability test. Any impairment loss for an asset group must reduce only the carrying amounts of a long-lived asset or assets of the group, including the ROU assets. The loss must be allocated to the long-lived\nassets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group must not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value\nwhenever the fair value is determinable without undue cost and effort. ASC 360 prohibits the subsequent reversal of an impairment loss for an asset held and used. \nFair Value Considerations \nWhen determining the fair value of a ROU asset, we must estimate what market participants would pay to lease the asset or what a market\nparticipant would pay up front in one payment for the ROU asset, assuming no additional lease payments would be due. The ROU asset must be valued assuming its highest and best use, in its current form, even if that use differs from the current or\nintended use. If no market exists for an asset in its current form, but there is a market for a transformed asset, the costs to transform the asset are considered in the fair value estimate. Refer to Note 13, Fair Value Measurements. \nThere were no indications of impairment during the period ended December 31, 2020. \nIncome Tax Valuation Allowances (Deferred Taxes) \nIn preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by\nestimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for\nincome tax consider current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of audits conducted by tax authorities. Reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by\ntax authorities are established if necessary. Although we believe our judgments, assumptions and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any future tax audits could significantly impact\nthe amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.  We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates\nand assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the tax\nimplications are known. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted.  We record a\nvaluation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated\nwith estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred\ntax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets\nwould be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance.  As a result of our adjusted cumulative\nthree-year pre-tax book loss as of December 31, 2020, we performed quarterly assessments of positive and negative evidence with respect to the realization of our net deferred tax assets. This assessment\nincluded the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the availability of carryforwards and estimates of projected future taxable income. The economic uncertainty from the \n  58 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic provided additional negative evidence that outweighed positive evidence resulting in our conclusion that additional deferred tax assets\nof $35.1 million related to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are more likely than not to be not realized. As such, an additional valuation allowance of $35.1 million was recorded, for a total valuation allowance of\n$48.1 million as of the year ended December 31, 2020.  Income Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions \nWe are subject to audit and review by various taxing jurisdictions. We may recognize liabilities on our financial statements for positions taken on uncertain\ntax positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others may be subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount\nof the position that would be ultimately sustained. Such positions are deemed to be unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding liability is established on the balance sheet. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as\nthis requires us to make estimates based on the various possible outcomes. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not\nthat the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.  We review and reevaluate\nuncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Changes in assumptions may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized liabilities associated with\nuncertain tax positions around our subsidiary Salem Communications Holding Company’s Pennsylvania tax filing. The position taken on the tax returns follows Pennsylvania Notice 2016-01 which provides\nguidance for reversal of intercompany interest income and associated expense yielding a net loss for Pennsylvania. The current liability recognized for the tax position is $0.3 million including interest and penalties. Our evaluation was\nperformed for all tax years that remain subject to examination, which range from 2016 through 2019.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements \nRecent accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements. \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Our principal sources of\nfunds are operating cash flows, borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from the sale of selected assets or businesses. We have historically funded, and will continue to fund, expenditures for operations, administrative expenses, and capital\nexpenditures from these sources. We have historically financed acquisitions through borrowings, including borrowings under credit facilities and, to a lesser extent, from operating cash flow and from proceeds on selected asset dispositions. We\nexpect to fund future acquisitions from cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities, operating cash flow and possibly through the sale of income-producing assets or proceeds from debt and equity offerings. \nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. We experienced\ndeclining revenue from advertising, programming, events and book sales. Several advertisers reduced or ceased advertising spend due to the outbreak and stay-at-home\norders that effectively shut many businesses down. This was particularly true within our broadcast segment, which derives substantial revenue from local advertisers who have been particularly hard hit due to social distancing and government\ninterventions and in our publishing segment that sells books in retail stores and through live events.  Future availability under our credit facility is\ncontingent upon our eligible receivable balance, which is negatively impacted by lower revenue and longer days to collect. Availability under our ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of (a) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable\nplus (b) a calculated amount based on \n  59 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nthe value of certain real property. The maximum amount available under our ABL Facility declined to $24.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $26.4 million at December 31, 2019,\nof which $5.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2020 compared to $12.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019.  In response to\nthese developments, beginning in March 2020, we implemented several measures to reduce costs and conserve cash to ensure that we have adequate cash to meet our debt servicing requirements, including: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n limiting capital expenditures; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n reducing discretionary spending, including travel and entertainment; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n eliminating open positions and freezing new hires; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n reducing staffing levels; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n implementing temporary company-wide pay cuts of 5%, 7.5% or 10% depending on salary level; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n furloughing certain employees; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n temporarily suspending the company 401(k) match; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n requesting rent concessions from landlords; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n requesting discounts from vendors; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n offering early payment discounts to certain customers in exchange for advance cash payments; and\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n suspending the payment of distributions on our common stock indefinitely. \nWe have utilized certain benefits of the CARES Act, and we may be entitled to benefits under the CAA based on our individual locations, including: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the deferral of all employer FICA taxes beginning in April 2020 for the remainder of 2020, with 50% payable in\nDecember 2021 and the remainder payable in December 2022;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n relaxation of interest expense deduction limitation for income tax purposes; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Payroll Protection Plan (“PPP”) loans available based on the eligibility determined on a per-location basis of up to $11.2 million on a consolidated basis.  Due to the adverse economic\nimpact, we reforecast our anticipated results extending through March 2022. Our reforecast includes the impact of certain of these cost-cutting measures. Based on our current and expected economic outlook and our current and expected funding needs,\nwe believe that the borrowing capacity under our current credit facilities, together with cash on hand, allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund necessary capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service requirements for at least\nthe next twelve months, including the working capital deficit at December 31, 2020. Based on our current assessment, we believe that we have the ability to meet our obligations as they come due for one year from the issuance of this annual\nreport.  During 2020 we began to keep higher balances of cash and cash equivalents on-hand to meet operating needs\ndue to the adverse economic conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, we keep the balance of cash and cash equivalents low in order to reduce the balance of outstanding debt. Our ABL Facility\nautomatically covers any shortfalls in operating cash flows such that we are not required to hold excess cash balances on hand. Our cash and cash equivalents increased to $6.3 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $6,000 at\nDecember 31, 2019. Working capital increased $6.3 million to $(5.1) million at December 31, 2020 compared to ($11.4 million) at December 31, 2019 due to the $6.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, a\n$3.2 million increase in assets held for sale and a $7.4 million decrease in the outstanding balance on the ABL Facility, that was partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable of $6.4 million, an increase in contract\nliabilities of $2.2 million. \n  60 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOperating Cash Flows \nOur largest source of operating cash inflows are receipts from customers in exchange for advertising and programming. Other sources of operating cash inflows\ninclude receipts from customers for digital downloads and streaming, book sales, subscriptions, self-publishing fees, ticket sales, sponsorships, and vendor promotions. The adverse economic impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our revenue and cash receipts from customers. A majority of our operating cash outflows consist of payments to employees, such as salaries and benefits, and vendor\npayments under facility and tower leases, talent agreements, inventory purchases and recurring services such as utilities and music license fees. Our operating cash flows are subject to factors such as fluctuations in preferred advertising media and\nchanges in demand caused by shifts in population, station listenership, demographics, and audience tastes. In addition, our operating cash flows may be affected if our customers are unable to pay, delay payment of amounts owed to us, or if we\nexperience reductions in revenue, or increases in costs and expenses.  Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $5.8 million during the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 to $22.8 million from $17.0 million during the prior year. The increase in cash provided by operating activities includes the impact of the following items: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Trade accounts receivables, net of allowances, decreased by $6.4 million compared to a decrease of\n$2.2 million for the prior year;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Operating expenses exclusive of depreciation, amortization, changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, impairments and net gain (loss) on the disposition of assets, decreased by $6.6 million;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Unbilled revenue increased $0.2 million; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Our Day’s Sales Outstanding, or the average number of days to collect cash from the date of sale, decreased\nto 59 days at December 31, 2020 from 60 days in the same period of the prior year;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n We deferred cash payments of $3.3 million for the employer portion of FICA taxes as allowed under the CARES\nAct with 50% due December 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 2022; and   \n\n\n \n•\n \n We reduced cash paid for rent by $1.0 million of which $0.3 million was abated and $0.7 million\nwas deferred over pay-back periods ranging from one-month in 2020 to forty-four months through December 2024. \nInvesting Cash Flows  Our primary source of investing\ncash inflows includes proceeds from the sale of assets or businesses. Investing cash outflows include cash payments made to acquire businesses, to acquire property and equipment and to acquire intangible assets such as domain names. While our focus\ncontinues to be on deleveraging, we remain committed to explore and pursue strategic acquisitions.  In recent years, we entered acquisition agreements\nthat contain contingent earn-out arrangements that are payable in the future based on the achievement of predefined operating results. We believe that these contingent\nearn-out arrangements provide some degree of protection with regard to our cash outflows should these acquisitions not meet our operational expectations. \nWe undertake projects from time to time to upgrade our radio station technical facilities and/or FCC broadcast licenses, expand our digital and web-based offerings, improve our facilities and upgrade our computer infrastructures. The nature and timing of these upgrades and expenditures can be delayed or scaled back at the discretion of management. Based on\nour current plans, we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $11.6 million during 2021. As noted, we are currently limiting capital expenditures to emergency-only type expenses. \n  61 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe plan to fund any future purchases and any future acquisitions from cash on hand, operating cash flow or\nour credit facilities.  Net cash used in investing activities was $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash\nprovided by investing activities of $10.9 million during the prior year. The $13.8 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was the result of:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Proceeds from the sale of assets decreased $20.5 million to $0.2 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 compared to $20.7 million of cash during same period of the prior year;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Proceeds of $2.4 million were received from surrendering split-dollar life insurance policies;\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n Cash paid for capital expenditures decreased $3.2 million to $4.6 million from $7.8 million during\nthe same period of the prior year; and   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Cash paid for acquisitions decreased $0.9 million to $0.4 million compared to $1.3 million during\nthe same period of the prior year.  Financing Cash Flows \nFinancing cash inflows include borrowings under our credit facilities and any proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under our stock incentive\nplan. Financing cash outflows include repayments of our credit facilities, the payment of distributions on our common stock and payments of amounts due under deferred installments and contingency earn-out\nconsideration associated with acquisition activity.  During the year ended December 31, 2020, the aggregate principal balances outstanding under the\nNotes and ABL Facility ranged from $221.3 million to $235.4 million. These outstanding balances were ordinary and customary based on our operating and investing cash needs during this time. \nOur sole source of cash available for making any future distributions on our common stock is our operating cash flow, subject to our credit facilities and\nNotes, which contain covenants that restrict the payment of dividends and distributions to our equity holders unless certain specified conditions are satisfied. On May 6, 2020 our Board voted to discontinue distributions on our common stock\nindefinitely due to the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. \nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $14.4 million to $13.6 million compared to\n$28.0 million during the prior year. The decrease in cash used for financing activities includes:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A $5.1 million decrease in cash distributions on common stock to $0.7 million from $5.8 million,\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n Net payments on our ABL Facility were $7.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to\nnet payments of $7.2 million during the prior year; and   \n\n\n \n•\n \n We used $3.4 million of cash to repurchase $3.5 million in face value of the 6.75% Senior Secured Notes\ncompared to $16.8 million of cash to repurchase $18.7 million during the prior year.  6.75% Senior Secured Notes \nOn May 19, 2017, we issued the Notes in a private placement. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by our existing subsidiaries (the\n“Subsidiary Guarantors”). The Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per year and mature on June 1, 2024, unless they are earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest initially accrued on the Notes from May 19, 2017 and is payable\nsemi-annually, in cash in arrears, on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2017.  The Notes are secured by a\nfirst-priority lien on substantially all assets of ours and the Subsidiary Guarantors other than the ABL Facility Priority Collateral (as described below) (the “Notes Priority Collateral”). There is no\n\n  62 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ndirect lien on our FCC licenses to the extent prohibited by law or regulation (other than the economic value and proceeds thereof). \nThe Notes were redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or before June 1, 2020 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus\na “make-whole” premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. At any time on or after June 1, 2020, the Notes are redeemable at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of\nthe principal amount to be redeemed) set forth in the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.  The\nindenture relating to the Notes (the “Indenture”) contains covenants that, among other things and subject in each case to certain specified exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur\nadditional debt; (ii) declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders; (iii) make investments; (iv) create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; (v) merge or consolidate, or\nsell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets; (vi) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (vii) sell or transfer assets. \nThe Indenture provides for the following events of default (each, an “Event of Default”): (i) default in payment of principal or premium on the\nNotes at maturity, upon repurchase, acceleration, optional redemption or otherwise; (ii) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the Notes; (iii) the failure by us or certain restricted subsidiaries to comply with other agreements in\nthe Indenture or the Notes, in certain cases subject to notice and lapse of time; (iv) the failure of any guarantee by certain significant Subsidiary Guarantors to be in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms,\nsubject to notice and lapse of time; (v) certain accelerations (including failure to pay within any grace period) of other indebtedness of ours or any restricted subsidiary if the amount accelerated (or so unpaid) is at least $15 million;\n(vi) certain judgments for the payment of money in excess of $15 million; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us or any significant subsidiary; and (viii) certain defaults with respect to any\ncollateral having a fair market value in excess of $15 million. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal of the Notes and\nany accrued interest on the Notes to be due and payable immediately, subject to remedy or cure in certain cases. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Notes being due and payable immediately upon\nthe occurrence of such Events of Default. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under the Indenture. \nBased on the balance of the Notes currently outstanding, we are required to pay $14.6 million per year in interest on the Notes. As of December 31,\n2020, accrued interest on the Notes was $1.2 million.  We incurred debt issuance costs of $6.3 million that were recorded as a reduction of the\ndebt proceeds that are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the life of the Notes using the effective interest method. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.7 million and\n$0.9 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs associated with the Notes was amortized to interest expense.  We may from time to time, depending\non market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, seek to repurchase the Notes in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, as market conditions\nwarrant. \n  63 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBased on the then existing market conditions, we completed repurchases of our 6.75% Senior Secured Notes at\namounts less than face value as follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Date\n \nPrincipalRepurchased\n \n \nCash Paid\n \n \n% of FaceValue\n \n \nBond IssueCosts\n \n \nNet Gain\n \n\n \n \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\nJanuary 30, 2020\n \n$\n2,250\n \n \n$\n2,194\n \n \n \n97.50\n% \n \n$\n34\n \n \n$\n 22\n \n\nJanuary 27, 2020\n \n \n1,245\n \n \n \n1,198\n \n \n \n96.25\n% \n \n \n20\n \n \n \n27\n \n\nDecember 27, 2019\n \n \n3,090\n \n \n \n2,874\n \n \n \n93.00\n% \n \n \n48\n \n \n \n167\n \n\nNovember 27, 2019\n \n \n5,183\n \n \n \n4,548\n \n \n \n87.75\n% \n \n \n82\n \n \n \n553\n \n\nNovember 15, 2019\n \n \n3,791\n \n \n \n3,206\n \n \n \n84.58\n% \n \n \n61\n \n \n \n524\n \n\nMarch 28, 2019\n \n \n2,000\n \n \n \n1,830\n \n \n \n91.50\n% \n \n \n37\n \n \n \n134\n \n\nMarch 28, 2019\n \n \n2,300\n \n \n \n2,125\n \n \n \n92.38\n% \n \n \n42\n \n \n \n133\n \n\nFebruary 20, 2019\n \n \n125\n \n \n \n114\n \n \n \n91.25\n% \n \n \n2\n \n \n \n9\n \n\nFebruary 19, 2019\n \n \n350\n \n \n \n319\n \n \n \n91.25\n% \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n24\n \n\nFebruary 12, 2019\n \n \n1,325\n \n \n \n1,209\n \n \n \n91.25\n% \n \n \n25\n \n \n \n91\n \n\nJanuary 10, 2019\n \n \n570\n \n \n \n526\n \n \n \n92.25\n% \n \n \n9\n \n \n \n35\n \n\nDecember 21, 2018\n \n \n2,000\n \n \n \n1,835\n \n \n \n91.75\n% \n \n \n38\n \n \n \n127\n \n\nDecember 21, 2018\n \n \n1,850\n \n \n \n1,702\n \n \n \n92.00\n% \n \n \n35\n \n \n \n113\n \n\nDecember 21, 2018\n \n \n1,080\n \n \n \n999\n \n \n \n92.50\n% \n \n \n21\n \n \n \n60\n \n\nNovember 17, 2018\n \n \n1,500\n \n \n \n1,357\n \n \n \n90.50\n% \n \n \n29\n \n \n \n114\n \n\nMay 4, 2018\n \n \n4,000\n \n \n \n3,770\n \n \n \n94.25\n% \n \n \n86\n \n \n \n144\n \n\nApril 10, 2018\n \n \n4,000\n \n \n \n3,850\n \n \n \n96.25\n% \n \n \n87\n \n \n \n63\n \n\nApril 9, 2018\n \n \n2,000\n \n \n \n1,930\n \n \n \n96.50\n% \n \n \n43\n \n \n \n27\n \n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n\n\n \n$\n 38,659\n \n \n$\n 35,586\n \n \n\n\n\n \n$\n 706\n \n \n$\n 2,367\n \n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility \nOn May 19, 2017, the company entered into the ABL Facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) by and among us and our\nsubsidiaries party thereto as borrowers, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and lead arranger, and the lenders that are parties thereto. We used the proceeds of the ABL Facility, together with the net proceeds from the\nNotes offering, to repay outstanding borrowings under our previously existing senior credit facilities, and related fees and expenses. Current proceeds from the ABL Facility are used to provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate\npurposes, including permitted acquisitions.  The ABL Facility is a five-year $30.0 million revolving credit facility due March 1, 2024, which\nincludes a $5.0 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a $7.5 million subfacility for swingline loans. All borrowings under the ABL Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to a base rate or LIBOR plus a spread. The spread,\nwhich is based on an availability-based measure, ranges from 0.50% to 1.00% for base rate borrowings and 1.50% to 2.00% for LIBOR borrowings. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate may increase by 2.00% per annum. Amounts outstanding under\nthe ABL Facility may be paid and then reborrowed at our discretion without penalty or premium. Additionally, we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance from 0.25% to 0.375% per year based on the level of borrowings. \nOn October 20, 2020, we entered into a fourth amendment to our ABL Facility that provides a one-time waiver with\nrespect to the current covenant testing period allowing the covenant trigger event date be the first day after the availability on the ABL Facility had equaled or exceeded (1) 15% of the maximum revolver amount and (2) $4.5 million and a waiver\npermitting our July 2020 financial statements to be issued on or before September 30, 2020 due to delays that were caused by a ransomware attack.  On\nApril 7, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to ABL Facility that increased the advance rate on eligible accounts receivable from 85% to 90% and extended the maturity date from May 19, 2022 to March 1, 2024. The\n\n  64 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nApril 7, 2020 amendment also allows for an alternative benchmark rate that may include SOFR due to LIBOR being scheduled to be discontinued at the end of calendar year 2021. \nAvailability under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of (a) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount\nbased on the value of certain real property. As of December 31, 2020, the amount available under the ABL Facility was $24.2 million of which $5.0 million was outstanding. The ABL Facility has a first-priority lien on our and the\nSubsidiary Guarantors’ accounts receivable, inventory, deposit and securities accounts, certain real estate and related assets (the “ABL Facility Priority Collateral”) and by a second-priority lien on the Notes Priority Collateral.\nThere is no direct lien on our FCC licenses to the extent prohibited by law or regulation (other than the economic value and proceeds thereof).  The\nCredit Agreement includes a springing fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0, which is tested during the period commencing on the last day of the fiscal month most recently ended prior to the date on which Availability (as defined in the Credit\nAgreement) is less than the greater of 15% of the Maximum Revolver Amount (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and $4.5 million and continuing for a period of 60 consecutive days after the first day on which Availability exceeds such threshold\namount. The Credit Agreement also includes other negative covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this type, including covenants that, subject to exceptions described in the Credit Agreement, restrict our ability and the ability of our\nsubsidiaries (i) to incur additional indebtedness; (ii) to make investments; (iii) to make distributions, loans or transfers of assets; (iv) to enter into, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any liens, (v) to sell\nassets; (vi) to enter into transactions with affiliates; (vii) to merge or consolidate with, or dispose of all assets to a third party, except as permitted thereby; (viii) to prepay indebtedness; and (ix) to pay dividends. \nThe Credit Agreement provides for the following events of default: (i) default for non-payment of any principal\nor letter of credit reimbursement when due or any interest, fees or other amounts within five days of the due date; (ii) the failure by any borrower or any subsidiary to comply with any covenant or agreement contained in the Credit Agreement or\nany other loan document, in certain cases subject to applicable notice and lapse of time; (iii) any representation or warranty made pursuant to the Credit Agreement or any other loan document is incorrect in any material respect when made;\n(iv) certain defaults of other indebtedness of any borrower or any subsidiary of indebtedness of at least $10 million; (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to any borrower or any subsidiary; (vi) certain\njudgments for the payment of money of $10 million or more; (vii) a change of control; and (viii) certain defaults relating to the loss of FCC licenses, cessation of broadcasting and termination of material station contracts. If an\nevent of default occurs and is continuing, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may accelerate the amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we\nremain, in compliance with all of the covenants under Credit Agreement.  We incurred debt issue costs of $0.9 million that were recorded as an asset\nand are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the term of the ABL Facility using the effective interest method. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.2 million of\ndebt issuance costs associated with the ABL Facility was amortized to interest expense. At December 31, 2020, the blended interest rate on amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility was 2.5%. \nWe report outstanding balances on the ABL Facility as short-term regardless of the maturity date based on use of the ABL Facility to fund ordinary and\ncustomary operating cash needs with frequent repayments. We believe that our borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service requirements for at\nleast the next twelve months. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Agreement. \n  65 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSummary of long-term debt obligations \nLong-term debt consisted of the following:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nAs of December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n2019\n \n  \n2020\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n 6.75% Senior Secured Notes\n  \n$\n219,836\n \n  \n$\n216,341\n \n\n Less unamortized debt issuance costs based on imputed interest rate of 7.08%\n  \n \n(3,368\n) \n  \n \n(2,577\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n 6.75% Senior Secured Notes net carrying value\n  \n \n216,468\n \n  \n \n213,764\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility principal outstanding\n  \n \n12,426\n \n  \n \n5,000\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Long-term debt less unamortized debt issuance costs\n  \n \n228,894\n \n  \n \n218,764\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Less current portion\n  \n \n(12,426\n) \n  \n \n(5,000\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Long-term debt less unamortized debt issuance costs, net of current portion\n  \n$\n216,468\n \n  \n$\n213,764\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n In addition to the outstanding amounts listed above, we also have interest payments related to our long-term debt as follows\nas of December 31, 2020:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n $5.0 million under the ABL Facility, with interest spread ranging from Base Rate plus 0.50% to 1.00% for\nbase rate borrowings and LIBOR plus 1.50% to 2.00% for LIBOR borrowings;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n $216.3 million aggregate principal amount of Notes with semi-annual interest payments at an annual rate of\n6.75%; and   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375% per annum on the unused portion of the ABL Facility. \nMaturities of Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations \nPrincipal repayment requirements under all long-term debt agreements outstanding at December 31, 2020 for each of the next five years and thereafter are\nas follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nAmount\n \n\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n 2021\n  \n$\n5,000\n \n\n 2022\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n 2023\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n 2024\n  \n \n216,341\n \n\n 2025\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n Thereafter\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n\n  \n$\n221,341\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n Impairment Losses on Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \nWe have incurred impairment losses associated with goodwill and indefinite lived assets, including broadcast licenses and mastheads.

The long-term revenue growth rates are specific for each market and ranged from 0.5%—1.2% as of the 2018 testing\nperiod to a range of 0.7%—1.1% as of the 2019 testing period resulting in a decline in operating profit margins from 4.4%—34.5% in 2018 to 4.0%—33.8% in 2019.

Declines in excess of these amounts and/or failure to achieve the anticipated growth rates may result in\nfuture impairment losses, the amount of which may be material.  The valuation of intangible assets is subjective and based on estimates rather than\nprecise calculations. If actual future results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future, the amount of which may be material. The fair value measurements for our\nindefinite-lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk. The unobservable inputs are\ndefined in FASB ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” as Level 3 inputs discussed in detail in Note 13 of our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this annual report. If actual future results\nare not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future, the amount of which may be material. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash\nflows of the respective market clusters and reporting units.  While the impairment charges we have recognized are\nnon-cash in nature and have not violated any debt covenants, the potential for future impairment charges can be viewed as a negative factor with regard to forecasted future performance and cash flows. We\nbelieve that we have adequately considered the potential for an economic downturn in our valuation models and do not believe that the non-cash impairments in and of themselves are a liquidity risk. \nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred\nto as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As\nsuch, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. \nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  Not required for smaller\nreporting companies.   \n\n\nITEM 7A.\n QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. \nNot required for smaller reporting companies. \n  67 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nITEM 8.

Camarillo, California  Opinion on the Financial\nStatements  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Salem Media Group, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020\nand 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial\nstatements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\ntwo years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Basis\nfor Opinion  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company\nin accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  We\nconducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matters  The critical audit matters communicated\nbelow are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial\nstatements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \nBroadcast License Impairment   As disclosed in\nNote 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated broadcast license balance was $319.8 million as of December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment on\nbroadcast licenses of $17.0 million. Management performs an annual impairment test \n  69 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nduring the fourth quarter of each year, which includes a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a broadcast license is impaired. This qualitative assessment requires\nsignificant judgment when considering the market conditions, events and circumstances that may affect the estimated fair value of broadcast licenses. If there are changes in market conditions, events, or other circumstances that occur during the\ninterim periods that indicate the carrying value of its broadcast licenses may be impaired, management determines whether an interim test is necessary. Broadcast licenses are assessed for recoverability at the market cluster level. Potential\nimpairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a market cluster’s broadcast licenses to the carrying value. Fair value is estimated by management using the Greenfield method, which is a form of the income approach, assuming a start-up scenario in which the only assets held by an investor are broadcasting licenses. Management’s cash flow projections for its broadcast licenses included significant judgments and assumptions relating to\nthe market share and profit margin of an average station within a market based upon market size and station type, the forecasted growth rate of each radio market (including long-term growth rate), and the discount rate. \nWe considered auditing broadcast license impairment to be a critical audit matter because it involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating\nmanagement’s estimates, judgments and assumptions, significant audit effort due to complexity in the aggregation and evaluation of significant amounts of data, and the use of valuation specialists. \nOur audit procedures related to broadcast license impairment included the following:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n evaluated management’s judgments in their assessment of identifying changes in market conditions, events or\nother circumstances that indicate an impairment of broadcast licenses may be present;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n tested the completeness, accuracy, appropriateness of aggregation and relevance of underlying data used in the\nvaluation model based on Greenfield method;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n evaluated the significant assumptions used by management, including normalized market share and profit margin of\nan average station within a market based upon market size and station type, the forecasted growth rate of each radio market (including long-term growth rate), and the discount rate.    This involved evaluating whether the\nassumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance in the market being evaluated, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were\nconsistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n utilized valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of valuation model used, evaluating\ncertain assumptions applied in the valuation model, and recalculations of the discounted cash flow schedules.  Realizability of\nDeferred Tax Assets  As disclosed in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2020, the Company had gross deferred\ntax assets on deductible temporary differences and carryforwards of $76.9 million reduced by a valuation allowance of $48.1 million. Deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of all available\nevidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks\nassociated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Such assessment involves a significant level of judgment and estimation, including\ncomplexity in the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the availability of carryforwards and estimates of projected future taxable income. The valuation allowance primarily related to federal and state net operating loss\ncarryforwards that are more likely than not to not be realized.  We considered auditing the realizability of deferred tax assets to be a critical audit\nmatter because it involved a high degree of subjectivity and audit effort in evaluating management’s estimates and judgments as well as \n  70 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ncomplexity in the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the availability of carryforwards and estimates of projected future taxable income due to uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic. Management’s judgments included assessing that all available positive and negative evidence and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies are analyzed to determine whether a\ndeferred tax asset or a portion thereof is “more likely than not” to be realized. Our audit of the realizability of deferred tax assets also included the assistance of tax specialists. \nOur audit procedures related to realizability of deferred tax assets included the following: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n evaluated management’s judgments over positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of\nrealization of deferred tax assets, which included cumulative losses in recent years, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, availability of carryforwards, industry wide declining revenue from reductions in advertising spend due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n evaluated management’s judgment of the uncertainty from the COVID-19\npandemic and its impact, based on current and forecasted industry and economic trends, on future earnings and verified the information used was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n utilized tax specialists to evaluate the application of jurisdictional tax laws and regulations used in the\nCompany’s assumptions and calculations and to test the completeness and accuracy of management’s scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, apportionment factors and the availability of carryforwards. \n/s/ Crowe LLP  We have served as the Company’s auditor\nsince 2016.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION  Description of\nBusiness  Salem Media Group, Inc. (“Salem” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “company”) is a domestic\nmultimedia company specializing in Christian and conservative content. Our media properties include radio broadcasting, digital media, and publishing entities. We have three operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and\n(3) Publishing, which are discussed in Note 20. Segment Data.  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Salem include the company and\nits wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic  In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. The responses by federal, state and local governments to restrict public gatherings and travel rapidly grew to include\nstay-at-home orders, school closures and mandatory restrictions on non-essential businesses and services that has adversely\naffected workforces, certain economies, and financial markets resulting in a significant economic downturn. We experienced declining revenue from advertising, programming, events and book sales. Several advertisers reduced or ceased advertising\nspend due to the outbreak and stay-at-home orders that effectively shut many businesses down. This was particularly true within our broadcast segment, which derives\nsubstantial revenue from local advertisers who have been particularly hard hit due to social distancing and government interventions and in our publishing segment that sells books in retail stores and through live events. \nWhile this disruption is expected to be temporary, there remains to be considerable uncertainty around the duration. Although advertising revenue continues to\nimprove from the lowest levels experienced during April and May of 2020, it remains significantly below prior years. The exact timing and pace of the recovery has not been determinable as certain markets have reopened, some of which have since\nexperienced a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, resulting in varying degrees of reinstated stay-at-home orders. Due to continuing\nuncertainties regarding the ultimate scope and trajectory of COVID-19’s spread and evolution, it is impossible to predict the total impact that the pandemic will have on our business. If public and\nprivate entities continue to enforce restrictive measures, the material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could persist. Our businesses could also continue to be impacted by the disruptions\nfrom COVID-19 and resulting adverse changes in advertising customers and consumer behavior.  Future availability\nunder our credit facility is contingent upon our eligible receivable balance, which is negatively impacted by lower revenue and longer days to collect. Availability under our Asset Based Loan (“ABL Facility”) is subject to a borrowing base\nconsisting of (a) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount based on the value of certain real property. The maximum amount available under our ABL Facility declined to $24.2 million at December 31, 2020\nfrom $26.4 million at December 31, 2019, of which $5.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2020 compared to $12.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019. \nIn response to these developments, beginning in March 2020, we implemented several measures to reduce costs and conserve cash to ensure that we have adequate\ncash to meet our debt servicing requirements, including:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n limiting capital expenditures; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n reducing discretionary spending, including travel and entertainment; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n eliminating open positions and freezing new hires; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n reducing staffing levels; \n  77 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n•\n \n implementing temporary company-wide pay cuts of 5%, 7.5% or 10% depending on salary level; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n furloughing certain employees; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n temporarily suspending the company 401(k) match; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n requesting rent concessions from landlords; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n requesting discounts from vendors; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n offering early payment discounts to certain customers in exchange for advance cash payments; and\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n suspending the payment of distributions on our common stock indefinitely. \nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act provides\nopportunities for additional liquidity, loan guarantees, and other government programs to support companies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and their employees. On December 27, 2020, Congress passed the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act (“CAA”) that includes a second relief package, which, among other things, provides for an extension of the Payroll Support Program established by the CARES Act. We have utilized certain benefits of the CARES\nAct, and we may be entitled to benefits under the CAA based on our individual locations, including:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n the deferral of all employer FICA taxes beginning in April 2020 for the remainder of 2020, with 50% payable in\nDecember 2021 and the remainder payable in December 2022;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n relaxation of interest expense deduction limitation for income tax purposes; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Payroll Protection Plan (“PPP”) loans available based on the eligibility determined on a per-location basis of up to $11.2 million on a consolidated basis.  We believe that our customers\nhave benefited from the enhanced benefits provided by the CARES Act, and that they will also benefit from the CAA. The CAA provides for another round of direct payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, education funding, and aid to sectors still\nreeling from the economic fallout of the pandemic. While these measures may benefit many of our customers, we cannot assure you that the implementation of these measures will offset the negative impact of\nCOVID-19 on our customers. If the CAA or any additional stimulus measures are not sufficient to remediate the financial stress on our customers as a result of the pandemic, we may experience ongoing challenges\nin growing and maintain revenue and we may experience an increase in delinquencies that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods. \nWe continue to review and consider any available potential benefit under the CARES Act and the CAA for which we qualify. We cannot predict the manner in which\nsuch benefits or any of the other benefits described herein will be allocated or administered and we cannot assure you that we will be able to access such benefits in a timely manner or at all. If the U.S. government or any other governmental\nauthority agrees to provide such aid under the CARES Act, the CAA, or any other crisis relief assistance it may impose certain requirements on the recipients of the aid, including restrictions on executive officer compensation, dividends, prepayment\nof debt, limitations on debt and other similar restrictions that may apply for a period of time after the aid is repaid or redeemed in full.  Due to the\nadverse economic impact, we reforecast our anticipated results extending through March 2022. Our reforecast includes the impact of certain of these cost-cutting measures. Based on our current and expected economic outlook and our current and\nexpected funding needs, we believe that the borrowing capacity under our current credit facilities, together with cash on hand, allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund necessary capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service\nrequirements for at least the next twelve months, including the working capital deficit at December 31, 2020. Based on our current assessment, we believe that we have the ability to meet our obligations as they come due for one year from the\nissuance of this annual report. \n  78 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUse of Estimates \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \nCash and Cash Equivalents  We consider all highly\nliquid debt instruments, purchased with an initial maturity of three-months or less, to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value at each balance sheet date. \nTrade Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenue \nTrade accounts receivable, net of allowances: Trade accounts receivable includes amounts billed and due from our customers stated at their net estimated\nrealizable value to be settled in cash. Trade accounts receivable for our self-publishing services represent contractual amounts due under individual payment plans that are adjusted quarterly to exclude unearned or cancellable contracts. \n  79 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUnbilled revenue: Unbilled revenue represents revenue recognized in excess of the amounts billed to\nour customer. Unbilled revenue results from differences in the Broadcast Calendar and the end of the reporting period. The Broadcast Calendar is a uniform billing period adopted by broadcasters, agencies and advertisers for billing and planning\nfunctions. The Broadcast Calendar uses a standard broadcast week that starts on Monday and ends on Sunday with month end on the last Sunday of the calendar month. We recognize revenue based on the calendar month end and adjust for unbilled revenue\nwhen the Broadcast Calendar billings are at an earlier date as applicable. We bill our customers at the end-of-flight, end of the Broadcast Calendar or at calendar month\nend, as applicable, with standard payments terms of thirty days.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts \nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that may not be collected. The allowance is based on our\nhistorical collection experience, the age of the receivables, specific customer information and current economic conditions. Past due balances are generally not written-off until all collection efforts have\nbeen exhausted, including use of a collection agency. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current creditworthiness of each customer. If the financial\ncondition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant\nlosses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected. We do not include extended payment terms in our contracts with customers. \nInventory  Inventories consist of published books\nrecorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value as determined on a First-In First-Out (“FIFO”) cost method. \nInventory Reserves  We record a provision to\nexpense the balance of unsold inventory that we believe to be unrecoverable. We review historical data associated with book inventories and our own experiences to estimate the fair value of inventory on hand. Our analysis includes a review of actual\nsales returns, our allowances, royalty reserves, overall economic conditions and product demand. We regularly monitor actual performance to our estimates and make adjustments as necessary. Estimated inventory reserves may be adjusted, either\nfavorably or unfavorably, if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and/or the market. We have not modified our\nestimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected. \nProperty and Equipment  We account for property\nand equipment in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360-10, “Property, Plant and Equipment.” Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost represents the\nhistorical cost of acquiring the asset, including the costs necessarily incurred to bring it to the condition and location necessary for its intended use. For assets constructed for our own use, such as towers and buildings that are discrete\nprojects for which costs are separately accumulated and for which construction takes considerable time, we record capitalized interest. The amount of interest capitalized is the cost that could have been avoided had the asset not been constructed\nand is based on the average accumulated expenditures incurred over the capitalization period at the weighted average interest rate applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt. We capitalized interest of $27,000 and $0.2 million during the\nyears ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Repair and  maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Improvements are capitalized if they extend\nthe life of the \n  80 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nasset or enhance the quality or ability of the asset to benefit operations. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Category\n  \n Estimated Life\n\n Buildings\n  \n40 years\n\n Office furnishings and equipment\n  \n5 -10 years\n\n Antennae, towers and transmitting equipment\n  \n10 -20 years\n\n Studio, production, and mobile equipment\n  \n5 - 7 years\n\n Computer software and website development costs\n  \n3 years\n\n Record and tape libraries\n  \n3 years\n\n Automobiles\n  \n5 years\n\n Leasehold improvements\n  \nLesser of the useful life orremaining lease term\n The carrying value of property and equipment is evaluated periodically in relation to the operating performance and\nanticipated future cash flows of the underlying radio stations and business units for indicators of impairment. When indicators of impairment are present, and the cash flows estimated to be generated from these assets is less than the carrying\nvalue, an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the fair market value of the assets is recorded. See Note 6, Property and Equipment. \nInternally Developed Software and Website Development Costs \nWe capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal-use\nsoftware as specified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350-40\n“Internal-Use Software.” Capitalized costs are generally depreciated over the estimated useful life of three years. Costs incurred related to the conceptual design and maintenance of internal-use software are expensed as incurred. Website development activities include planning, design and development of graphics and content for new websites and operation of existing sites. Costs incurred that\ninvolve providing additional functions and features to the website are capitalized. Costs associated with website planning, maintenance, content development and training are expensed as incurred. We capitalized $3.4 million and\n$2.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively, related to internally developed software and website development costs. Depreciation expense of the amounts capitalized was $2.8 million and\n$2.6 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  Broadcast Licenses \nWe account for broadcast licenses in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.” We do not amortize broadcast\nlicenses, but rather test for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the value may be impaired.  Impairment\ntesting requires an estimate of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. We believe that these estimates of fair value are critical accounting estimates as the value is significant in relation to our total assets and the estimates\nincorporate variables and assumptions based on our experiences and judgment about our future operating performance. Fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market\nparticipants would use in measuring fair value, including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and estimates used in our estimates, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which\nmay be material. The unobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” as Level 3 inputs discussed in detail in Note 13, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. \nWe perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year as discussed in Note 8, Broadcast Licenses. \n  81 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGoodwill \nWe account for goodwill in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.” We do not amortize goodwill, but rather\ntest for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.  Impairment testing requires an\nestimate of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. We believe that these estimates of fair value are critical accounting estimates as the value is significant in relation to our total assets and the estimates incorporate variables\nand assumptions based on our experiences and judgment about our future operating performance. Fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in\nmeasuring fair value, including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and estimates used in our estimates, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. The\nunobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” as Level 3 inputs discussed in detail in Note 13, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. \nWe perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year as discussed in Note 9, Goodwill. \nAmortizable Intangible Assets  Intangible assets\nare recorded at cost less accumulated amortization. Typically, intangible assets are acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of broadcast entities, digital media entities and publishing entities. These intangibles are amortized using the\nstraight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Category\n  \n Estimated Life\n\n Customer lists and contracts\n  \nLesser of 5 years or the life of contract\n\n Domain and brand names\n  \n5 -7 years\n\n Favorable and assigned leases\n  \nLease Term\n\n Subscriber base and lists\n  \n3 -7 years\n\n Author relationships\n  \n1-7 years\n\n Non-compete agreements\n  \n1 to 5 years\n The carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated periodically in relation to the operating performance\nand anticipated future cash flows of the underlying radio stations and businesses for indicators of impairment. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360 “Property, Plant and Equipment,” when indicators of impairment are present and the\nundiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated from these assets are less than the carrying amounts of these assets, an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the fair market value of these assets is recorded, if necessary. No adjustments to\nthe carrying amounts of our amortizable intangible assets were necessary during the year ended December 31, 2020.  Deferred Financing Costs\n Debt issue costs are amortized to non-cash interest expense over the term of the agreement using the\neffective interest method.  On May 19, 2017, we closed on a private offering of $255.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior\nsecured notes due 2024 (the “Notes”) and concurrently entered into a five-year $30.0 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, which includes a $5.0 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a\n$7.5 million subfacility for swingline loans due May 19, 2022.  We incurred debt issuance costs of $6.3 million that were recorded as a\nreduction of the Note proceeds that are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the life of the Notes using the effective interest method. We \n  82 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nincurred debt issue costs of $0.9 million that were recorded as an asset and are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the term of the ABL\nFacility using the effective interest method. See Note 12, Long-Term Debt.  Income Tax Valuation Allowances (Deferred Taxes) \nWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes.” In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we\nestimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement\npurposes. We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are\ngenerally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the tax implications are known. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. \nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available\nevidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation\nallowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a\ndetermination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. \nFor financial reporting purposes, we recorded a valuation allowance of $28.4 million as of December 31, 2020 to offset $28.4 million of the\ndeferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards of $15.7 million and other financial statement accrual assets of $4.0 million, for a total valuation allowance of $48.1 million for the year ended December 31,\n2020. This balance represents an increase of $35.1 million during the year, from $13.0 million valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019. \nWe believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected. \nIncome Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions  We are\nsubject to audit and review by various taxing jurisdictions. We may recognize liabilities on our financial statements for positions taken on uncertain tax positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be\nsustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others may be subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. Such positions are deemed to be unrecognized\ntax benefits and a corresponding liability is established on the balance sheet. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to make estimates based on the various possible outcomes. The benefit of a tax\nposition is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or\nlitigation processes, if any.  We review and reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Changes in assumptions may result in the recognition\nof a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions around our subsidiary Salem Communications Holding Company’s\nPennsylvania tax filing. The position taken on the tax returns follows Pennsylvania Notice 2016-01 which provides guidance for reversal of intercompany interest income and associated expense yielding a net\nloss for Pennsylvania. The current liability recognized for the tax position is $0.3 million including interest and penalties. Our evaluation was performed for all tax years that remain subject to examination, which range from 2017 through 2020\n\n  83 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEffective Tax Rate \nOur provision for income tax as a percentage of operating income before taxes, or our effective tax rate, may be impacted by: \n \n\n\n \n(1)\n changes in the level of income in any of our taxing jurisdictions; \n \n\n\n \n(2)\n changes in statutes and rules applicable to taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n  \n\n\n \n(3)\n changes in the expected outcome of income tax audits; \n \n\n\n \n(4)\n changes in the estimate of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes; \n \n\n\n \n(5)\n income taxes in certain states where the states’ current taxable income is dependent on factors other than\nconsolidated net income;   \n\n\n \n(6)\n the addition of operations in states that on average have different income tax rates from states in which we\ncurrently operate; and   \n\n\n \n(7)\n the effect of previously reported temporary differences between the and financial reporting bases of assets and\nliabilities.  Our annual effective tax rate may also be materially impacted by tax expense associated with non-amortizable assets such as broadcast licenses and goodwill as well as changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance. An impairment loss for financial statement purposes will result in an income tax benefit\nduring the period incurred as the amortization of broadcasting licenses and goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.  Business Acquisitions\n We account for business acquisitions in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting as specified in FASB ASC Topic 805 “Business\nCombinations.” The total acquisition consideration is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the transaction. The total acquisition consideration is equal to the sum of\nall cash payments, the fair value of any deferred payments and promissory notes, and the present value of any estimated contingent earn-out consideration. Transactions that do not meet the definition of a\nbusiness in ASU 2017-01 “Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business” are recorded as asset purchases. Asset purchases are recognized based on their cost to\nacquire, including transaction costs. The cost to acquire an asset group is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair value with no goodwill recognized. \nEstimates of the fair value include discounted estimated cash flows to be generated by the assets and their expected useful lives based on historical\nexperience, market trends and any synergies believed to be achieved from the acquisition. Acquisitions may include contingent consideration, the fair value of which is estimated as of the acquisition date as the present value of the expected\ncontingent payments as determined using weighted probabilities of the payment amounts. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in Note\n13, Fair Value Measurements.  We may retain a third-party appraiser to estimate the fair value of the acquired net assets as of the acquisition date. As\npart of the valuation and appraisal process, the third-party appraiser prepares a report assigning estimated fair values to the various assets acquired. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and require careful consideration and\njudgment. Management reviews the third-party reports for reasonableness of the assigned values. We believe that these valuations and analysis provide appropriate estimates of the fair value for the net assets acquired as of the acquisition date.\n The initial valuations for business acquisitions are subject to refinement during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the\nacquisition date. During this measurement period, we may retroactively record adjustments to the net assets acquired based on additional information obtained for items that existed as of the \n  84 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nacquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any adjustments are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. To date, we have not recorded adjustments to the\nestimated fair values used in our business acquisition consideration during or after the measurement period.  Property and equipment are recorded at the\nestimated fair value and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Finite-lived intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nGoodwill, which represents the organizational systems and procedures in place to ensure the effective operation of the entity, may also be recorded and tested for impairment. \nCosts associated with business acquisitions, such as consulting and legal fees, are expensed as incurred. We did not incur acquisition related costs during\nthe year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0.1 million of acquisition related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019, which are included in unallocated corporate expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements\nof Operations.  Partial Self-Insurance on Employee Health Plan \nWe provide health insurance benefits to eligible employees under a self-insured plan whereby we pay actual medical claims subject to certain stop loss limits.\nWe record self-insurance liabilities based on actual claims filed and an estimate of those claims incurred but not reported. Our estimates are based on historical data and probabilities. Any projection of losses concerning our liability is subject\nto a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors such as future inflation rates, changes in severity, benefit level changes, medical costs and claim settlement patterns. Should the actual\namount of claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated, we may adjust our future reserves. Our self-insurance liability was $0.5 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We have not modified our\nestimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates.  The following table presents the changes\nin our partial self-insurance reserves:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n    2019    \n \n  \n    2020      \n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Balance, beginning of period\n  \n$\n828\n \n  \n$\n640\n \n\n Self-funded costs\n  \n \n8,087\n \n  \n \n7,477\n \n\n Claims paid\n  \n \n(8,275\n) \n  \n \n(7,574\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Ending period balance\n  \n$\n640\n \n  \n$\n543\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n Derivative Instruments \nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. We actively monitor these fluctuations and may use derivative instruments primarily for the\npurpose of reducing the impact of changing interest rates on our variable rate debt and to reduce the impact of changing fair market values on our fixed rate debt. In accordance with our risk management strategy, we may use derivative instruments\nonly for the purpose of managing risk associated with an asset, liability, committed transaction, or probable forecasted transaction that is identified by management. Our use of derivative instruments may result in short-term gains or losses that\nmay increase the volatility of our earnings.  Under FASB ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” the effective portion of the gain or\nloss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument shall be reported as a component of other comprehensive income (outside earnings) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which\nthe hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, shall be recognized currently in earnings. \n  85 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any outstanding derivative instruments. \nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures  As of\nDecember 31, 2020, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued interest approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of such instruments. The carrying value\nof the ABL Facility approximates fair value as the related interest rates approximate rates currently available to the company. The carrying amount of the Notes at December 31, 2020 was $216.3 million, compared to the estimated fair value\nof $199.0 million based on the prevailing interest rates and trading activity of our Notes. See Note 13, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. \nLong-term Debt and Debt Covenant Compliance  Our\nclassification of outstanding borrowings on our Notes as long-term debt on our balance sheet is based on our assessment that, under the Indenture and after considering our projected operating results and cash flows for the coming year, no principal\npayments are required to be made within the next twelve months. The Notes have a term of seven years, maturing on June 1, 2024. We may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal\namount to be redeemed) set forth in the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. See Note 12, Long-Term Debt. \nReserves for Royalty Advances  Royalties due to\nbook authors are paid in advance and capitalized. Royalties are expensed as the related book revenue is earned or when we determine that future recovery of the royalty is not likely. We reviewed historical data associated with royalty advances,\nearnings and recoverability based on actual results of Regnery® Publishing. Historically, the longer the unearned portion of an advance remains outstanding, the less likely it is that we will\nrecover the advance through the sale of the book. We apply this historical experience to outstanding royalty advances to estimate the likelihood of recovery. A provision was established to expense the balance of any unearned advance which we believe\nis not recoverable. Our analysis also considers other discrete factors, such as death of an author, any decision to not pursue publication of a title, poor market demand or other relevant factors. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we\nhave not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected. \nContingency Reserves  In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, we are involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits, arbitration and other claims which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of\nmonetary liability or the financial impact with respect to these matters.  We record contingency reserves to the extent we conclude that it is probable\nthat a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. The establishment of the reserve is based on a review of all relevant factors, the advice of legal counsel, and the subjective judgment of management.\nThe reserves we have recorded to date have not been material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.\n While we believe that the final resolution of any known matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect upon our\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, it is possible that we could incur additional losses. We maintain insurance that may provide coverage for such matters. Future claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could\nhave a material adverse effect upon our \n  86 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including losses due to costly litigation and losses due to matters that require significant amounts of management time that\ncan result in the diversion of significant operational resources. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies.  Revenue Recognition \nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”). ASC 606 is a\ncomprehensive revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers at an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive. \nSignificant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determining the amount of revenue to be recognized in any accounting period.\nApplication of ASC 606 requires a five-step model as discussed in Note 4, Revenue Recognition.  Stock-Based Compensation \nWe account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation.” We record equity\nawards with stock-based compensation measured at the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We determine the fair value of our options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that requires the input of highly subjective assumptions,\nincluding the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted. The exercise price for options is equal to the closing market price of Salem Media Group common stock as of the date of grant. We use the straight-line\nattribution method to recognize share-based compensation costs over the expected service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock awards, deferred\ntax assets for options and restricted stock awards with multiple vesting dates are eliminated for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting\nperiod was a separate award. See Note 16, Stock Incentive Plan.  Advertising and Promotional Cost \nCosts of media advertising and associated production costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to approximately $7.9 million and $9.2 million for\neach of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.  Leases \nWe adopted ASC 842 “Leases,” on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective basis and electing the package of practical expedients\nprovided by FASB. ASC 842 requires that lessees recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities calculated based on the present value of lease payments for all lease agreements with terms that are greater than twelve months. ASC 842 distinguishes leases\nas either a finance lease or an operating lease that affects how the leases are measured and presented in the statement of operations and statement of cash flows. \nFor operating leases, we calculated ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of the remaining lease payments as of the date of adoption\nusing the IBR as of that date. There were no changes in our capital lease portfolio, which are now titled “finance leases” under ASC 842, other than the reclassification of the assets acquired under capital leases from their respective\nproperty and equipment category and long-term debt to ROU assets and lease liabilities.  Accounting Policy Elections under ASC 842 \nLease Term  We calculate\nthe term for each lease agreement to include the noncancellable period specified in the agreement together with (1) the periods covered by options to extend the lease if we are reasonably certain\n\n  87 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nto exercise that option, (2) periods covered by an option to terminate if we are reasonably certain not to exercise that option and (3) period covered by an option to extend (or not\nterminate) if controlled by the lessor.  The assessment of whether we are reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease requires significant\njudgement surrounding contract-based factors, asset-based factors, entity-based factors and market-based factors. These factors are described in our Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates in Item 7 in this annual report. \nLease Payments  Lease\npayments consist of the following payments (as applicable) related to the use of the underlying asset during the lease term:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Fixed payments, including in substance fixed payments, less any lease incentives paid or payable to the lessee\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, such as the Consumer Price Index or a market interest\nrate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date of January 1, 2019.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n The exercise price of an option to purchase the underlying asset if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise\nthat option.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Payments for penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to\nterminate the lease.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Fees paid by the lessee to the owners of a special-purpose entity for structuring the transaction\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n For a lessee only, amounts probable of being owed by the lessee under residual value guarantees\n Short-Term Lease Exemption \nWe exclude short-term leases, or leases with a term of twelve months or less that do not contain a purchase option that we are reasonably\ncertain to exercise, from our ROU asset and lease liability calculations.  We considered the applicability of the short-term exception on month-to-month leases with perpetual or rolling renewals as we are “reasonably certain” to continue the lease. For example, we lease various storage facilities under\nagreements with month-to-month terms that have continued over several years. The standard terms and conditions for a majority of these agreements allow either party to\nterminate within a notice period ranging from 10 to 30 days. There are no cancellation penalties other than the potential loss of a one-month rent or a security deposit if the termination terms are not adhered\nto.  We believe that these month-to-month leases qualify for the\nshort-term exception to ASC 842 because either party can terminate the agreement without permission from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty, therefore, the arrangements do not create enforceable rights and obligations.\nAdditionally, the cost to move to a new location or find comparable facilities is low as there are no unique features of the storage facilities that impact our business or operations. We considered termination clauses, costs associated with moving\nand costs associated with finding alternative facilities to exclude month-to-month leases that have perpetually renewed. \nService Agreements with an Embedded Lease Component \nWe exclude certain service agreements that contain embedded leases for equipment based on the immaterial impact of these agreements. Our\nanalysis included cable and satellite television service agreements for which our monthly payment may include equipment rentals, coffee and water service at certain facilities that \n  88 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nmay include equipment rentals (we often meet minimum requirements and just pay for product used), security services that include a monthly fee for cameras or equipment, and other similar\narrangements. Based on the insignificant amount of the monthly lease costs, we exclude these agreements from our ROU asset and liability calculations due to the immaterial impact to our financial statements. \nIncremental Borrowing Rate \nThe ROU asset and related lease liabilities recorded under ASC 842 are calculated based on the present value of the lease payments using\n(1) the rate implicit in the lease or (2) the lessee’s IBR, defined as the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar\neconomic environment. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we estimate the IBR applicable to Salem using significant judgement and estimates, including the estimated value of the underlying leased asset, and the (a) credit history of\nSalem Media Group, (b) the credit worthiness of Salem Media Group, (c) the class of the underlying asset and the remaining term of the arrangement, and (d) the debt incurred under the lease liability as compared to amounts that would\nbe borrowed.  From these data points, we develop a matrix to estimate the IBR for each lease class. We review the IBR estimates on a quarterly basis and\nupdate as necessary. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not recognized significant changes in our estimates.  Our analysis required\nthe use of significant judgement and estimates, including the estimated value of the underlying leased asset, as described in are described in our Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates in Item 7 in this annual report. \nPortfolio Approach  We\napply a portfolio approach by applying a single IBR to leases with reasonably similar characteristics, including the remaining lease term, the underlying assets and the economic environment. We believe that applying the portfolio approach is\nacceptable because the results do not materially differ from the application of the leases model to the individual leases in that portfolio. \nSales Taxes and Other Similar Taxes \nWe do not evaluate whether sales taxes or other similar taxes imposed by a governmental authority on a specific lease revenue-producing\ntransaction that are collected by the lessor from the lessee are the primary obligation of the lessor as owner of the underlying leased asset. A lessor that makes this election will exclude these taxes from the measurement of lease revenue and the\nassociated expense. Taxes assessed on a lessor’s total gross receipts or on the lessor as owner of the underlying asset (e.g., property taxes) are excluded from the scope of the policy election. A lessor must apply the election to all taxes in\nthe scope of the policy election and would provide certain disclosures.  Separating Consideration between Lease and Non-Lease Components  We include the lease and non-lease\ncomponents (or the fixed and variable consideration) as a single component accounted for as a lease. This practical expedient is elected by class of underlying assets as an accounting policy election and applies to all arrangements in that class of\nunderlying assets that qualify for the expedient. ASC 842 provides this expedient to alleviate concerns that the costs and administrative burden of allocating consideration to the separate lease and non-lease\ncomponents may not justify the benefit of more precisely reflecting the ROU asset and the lease liability. \n  89 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nContracts that include lease and non-lease components that are\naccounted for under the election not to separate require that all components that qualify for the practical expedient be combined. The components that do not qualify, such as those for which the timing and pattern of transfer of the lease and\nassociated non-lease components are not the same, are accounted for separately.  Accounting for a lease component\nof a contract and its associated non-lease components as a single lease component results in an allocation of the total contract consideration to the lease component. Therefore, the initial and subsequent\nmeasurement of the lease liability and ROU asset is greater than if the policy election was not applied. The greater ROU asset value is considered in our impairment analysis. \nImpairment of ROU Assets  ROU assets are reviewed\nfor impairment when indicators of impairment are present. ROU assets from operating and finance leases are subject to the impairment guidance in ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment,” as ROU assets are long-lived nonfinancial\nassets.  ROU assets are tested for impairment individually or as part of an asset group if the cash flows related to the ROU asset are not independent\nfrom the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An asset group is the unit of accounting for long-lived assets to be held and used, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of\nother groups of assets and liabilities.  After a careful analysis of the guidance, we concluded that the appropriate unit of accounting for testing ROU\nassets for impairment is the broadcast market cluster level for radio station operations and the entity or division level for digital media entities, publishing entities and networks. Corporate ROU assets are tested on a consolidated level with\nconsideration given to all cash flows of the company as corporate functions do not generate cash flows and are funded by revenue-producing activities at lower levels of the entity. \nASC 360 requires three steps to identify, recognize and measure the impairment of a long-lived asset (asset group) to be held and used: \nStep 1—Consider whether Indicators of Impairment are Present \nAs detailed in ASC\n360-10-35-21, the following are examples of impairment indicators: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n A significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset (asset group) \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or\nin its physical condition   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a\nlong-lived asset (asset group), including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator   \n\n\n \n•\n \n An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or\nconstruction of a long-lived asset (asset group)   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a\nprojection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset (asset group)   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise\ndisposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The term more likely than not refers to a level of likelihood that is more than 50 percent. \nOther indicators should be considered if we believe that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. \n  90 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nStep 2—Test for Recoverability \nIf indicators of impairment are present, we are required to perform a recoverability test comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash\nflows attributable to the long-lived asset or asset group in question to the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group.  ASC\n360 does not specifically address how operating lease liabilities and future cash outflows for lease payments should be considered in the recoverability test. Under ASC 360, financial liabilities, or long-term debt, generally are excluded from an\nasset group while operating liabilities, such as accounts payable, generally are included. ASC 842 characterizes operating lease liabilities as operating liabilities. Because operating lease liabilities may be viewed as having attributes of finance\nliabilities as well as operating liabilities, it is generally acceptable for a lessee to either include or exclude operating lease liabilities from an asset group when testing whether the carrying amount of an asset group is recoverable provided the\napproach is applied consistently for all operating leases and when performing Steps 2 and 3 of the impairment model in ASC 360.  In cases\nwhere we have received lease incentives, including operating lease liabilities in an asset group may result in the long-lived asset or asset group having a zero or negative carrying amount because the incentives reduce our ROU assets. We elected to\nexclude operating lease liabilities from the carrying amount of the asset group such that we test ROU assets for operating leases in the same manner that we test ROU assets for financing leases. \nUndiscounted Future Cash Flows \nThe undiscounted future cash flows in Step 2 are based on our own assumptions rather than a market participant. If an election is made to\nexclude operating lease liabilities from the asset or asset group, all future cash lease payments for the lease should also be excluded. The standard requires lessees to exclude certain variable lease payments from lease payments and, therefore,\nfrom the measurement of a lessee’s lease liabilities. Because these variable payments do not reduce the lease liability, we include the variable payments we expect to make in our estimate of the undiscounted cash flows in the recoverability\ntest (Step 2) using a probability-weighted approach.  Step 3—Measurement of an Impairment Loss \nIf the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset (asset group), we are\nrequired to estimate the fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group and recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value. We elected to exclude operating lease\nliabilities from the estimated fair value, consistent with the recoverability test. Any impairment loss for an asset group must reduce only the carrying amounts of a long-lived asset or assets of the group, including the ROU assets. The loss must be\nallocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group must not reduce the carrying amount of that asset\nbelow its fair value whenever the fair value is determinable without undue cost and effort. ASC 360 prohibits the subsequent reversal of an impairment loss for an asset held and used. \nFair Value Considerations \nWhen determining the fair value of a ROU asset, we must estimate what market participants would pay to lease the asset or what a market\nparticipant would pay up front in one payment for the ROU asset, assuming no additional lease payments would be due. The ROU asset must be valued assuming its highest and best use, in its current form, even if that use differs from the current or\nintended use. If no market exists for an asset in its current form, but there is a market for a transformed asset, the costs to transform the asset are considered in the fair value estimate. Refer to Note 13, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\n\n  91 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThere were no indications of impairment during the year ended December 31, 2020. \nLeasehold Improvements  We may construct or\notherwise invest in leasehold improvements to properties. The costs of these leasehold improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the lease term including anticipated renewal\nperiods.  (Gain) Loss on the Disposition of Assets \nWe record gains or losses on the disposition of assets equal to the proceeds, if any, as compared to the net book value. Exchange transactions are accounted\nfor in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 845 “Non-Monetary Transactions.”  During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, we recorded a $1.4 million estimated pre-tax loss for associated with plans to exit the Miami broadcast market with the pending sale of radio station\nWKAT-AM and various other fixed asset disposals.  During the year ended December 31, 2019 we recorded a\n$9.4 million pre-tax loss for the sale of nine radio stations, WAFS-AM in Atlanta, Georgia, WWDJ-AM in Boston,\nMassachusetts, WHKZ-AM in Cleveland, Ohio, KEXB-AM (formerly KTNO-AM) in Dallas, Texas,\nKDMT-AM in Denver, Colorado, KTEK-AM in Houston, Texas, KRDY-AM in San Antonio, Texas and\nKXFN-AM and WSDZ-AM in St. Louis, Missouri, a $4.7 million pre-tax loss from the sale of four radio stations, WWMI-AM and WLCC-AM in Tampa, Florida and WZAB-AM and WOCN-AM (formerly WKAT-AM) in Miami, Florida, a $3.8 million pre-tax loss on the sale of radio station WSPZ-AM in Washington, D.C., a\n$1.6 million pre-tax loss from the sale of radio station WDYZ-AM (formerly WORL-AM) in Orlando, Florida, a $1.3 million\npre-tax loss on the exchange of radio station KKOL-AM in Seattle, Washington for KPAM-AM in Portland, Oregon, a $0.2 million\npre-tax loss on the sale Mike Turner’s line of investment products, a $0.2 million pre-tax loss on the sale of HumanEvents.com and a $1.5 million\nestimated pre-tax loss for the pending sale of radio station WBZW-AM in Orlando, Florida that was partially offset by a $0.4 million\npre-tax gain on the sale of a portion of land on our transmitter site in Miami, Florida and a $0.1 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Newport Natural Health. \nDiscontinued Operations  We regularly review\nunderperforming assets to determine if a sale or disposal might be a better way to monetize the assets. When a station, group of stations, or other asset group is considered for sale or disposal, we review the transaction to determine if or when the\nentity qualifies as a discontinued operation in accordance with the criteria of FASB ASC Topic 205-20 “Discontinued Operations.” \nBasic and Diluted Net Earnings Per Share  Basic\nnet earnings per share has been computed using the weighted average number of Class A and Class B shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares\nof Class A and Class B common stock outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effects of stock options.  Options to purchase 2,291,020 and\n1,860,722 shares of Class A common stock were outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding exclude outstanding stock options whose exercise price is in excess of the average price of the\ncompany’s stock price. These options are excluded from the respective computations of diluted net income or loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. \n  92 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe following table sets forth the shares used to compute basic and diluted net earnings per share for the\nperiods indicated:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n2019\n \n  \n2020\n \n\n Weighted average shares\n  \n \n26,502,934\n \n  \n \n26,683,363\n \n\n Effect of dilutive securities—stock options\n  \n \n—  \n \n  \n \n—  \n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Weighted average shares adjusted for dilutive securities\n  \n \n26,502,934\n \n  \n \n26,683,363\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n Segments  We have\nthree operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating segments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of\nsenior executives, assesses the performance of each operating segment and determines the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We continually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our\nbusiness and may make changes as necessary.  We measure and evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that do not\ninclude allocations of costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury, which are reported as unallocated corporate expenses in our consolidated statements of operations included in this\nannual report. We also exclude costs such as amortization, depreciation, taxes and interest expense.  Variable Interest Entities \nWe may enter into agreements or investments with other entities that could qualify as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in accordance with FASB ASC\nTopic 810 “Consolidation” (“ASC 810.”) A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial\ninterests in the VIE, either explicitly or implicitly. A VIE is an entity for which the primary beneficiary’s interest in the entity can change with variations in factors other than the amount of investment in the entity. We perform our\nevaluation for VIE’s upon entry into the agreement or investment. We re-evaluate the VIE when or if events occur that could change the status of the VIE. \nWe may enter into lease arrangements with entities controlled by our principal stockholders or other related parties. We believe that the requirements of FASB\nASC 810 do not apply to these entities because the lease arrangements do not contain explicit guarantees of the residual value of the real estate, do not contain purchase options or similar provisions and the leases are at terms that do not vary\nmaterially from leases that would have been available with unaffiliated parties. Additionally, we do not have an equity interest in the entities controlled by our principal stockholders or other related parties and we do not guarantee debt of the\nentities controlled by our principal stockholders or other related parties.  We also enter into Local Marketing Agreements (“LMAs”) or Time\nBrokerage Agreements (“TBAs”) contemporaneously with entering into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) to acquire or sell a radio station. Typically, both LMAs and TBAs are contractual agreements under which the station\nowner/licensee makes airtime available to a programmer/licensee in exchange for a fee and reimbursement of certain expenses. LMAs and TBAs are subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and the communications laws, including the requirement that\nthe licensee must maintain independent control over the station and, in particular, its personnel, programming, and finances. The FCC has held that such agreements do not violate the communications laws as long as the licensee of the station\nreceiving programming from another station maintains ultimate responsibility for, and control over, station operations and otherwise ensures compliance with the communications laws. \n  93 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe requirements of FASB ASC 810 may apply to entities under LMAs or TBAs, depending on the facts and\ncircumstances related to each transaction. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have implicit or explicit arrangements that required consolidation under the guidance in FASB ASC 810. \nConcentrations of Business Risks  We derive a\nsubstantial part of our total revenue from the sale of advertising. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 30.7% and 35.3%, respectively, of our total broadcast revenue was generated from the sale of broadcast advertising. We are\nparticularly dependent on revenue from stations in the Los Angeles and Dallas markets, which generated 14.1% and 22.1% of the total broadcast advertising revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 15.0% and 20.4% of the total broadcast\nadvertising revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. Because substantial portions of our revenue is derived from local advertisers in these key markets, our ability to generate revenue in those markets could be adversely affected by local\nor regional economic downturns.  Concentrations of Credit Risks \nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents; trade accounts receivable and\nderivative instruments. We place our cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions. Such balances may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. To manage the related credit exposure, we\ncontinually monitor the credit worthiness of the financial institutions where we have deposits. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets in which we provide\nservices, as well as the dispersion of our operations across many geographic areas. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, but generally do not require collateral to support customer receivables. We establish an allowance for\ndoubtful accounts based on various factors including the credit risk of specific customers, age of receivables outstanding, historical trends, economic conditions and other information. Historically, our bad debt expense has been within\nmanagement’s expectations.  These estimates require the use of judgment as future events and the effect of these events cannot be predicted with\ncertainty. The estimates will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired and as more information is obtained. We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and we may consult outside experts to assist as\nconsidered necessary.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements \nChanges to accounting principles are established by the FASB in the form of ASUs to the FASB’s Codification. We consider the applicability and impact of\nall ASUs on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof. Described below are ASUs that are not yet effective, but may be applicable to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation\nthereof. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to not be applicable to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof. \nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope, which refines the scope\nof ASC 848, Reference Rate Reform, and clarifies guidance as part of the FASB’s ongoing monitoring of global reference rate reform activities. The ASU permits entities to elect certain optional expedients and exceptions when accounting\nfor derivative contracts and certain hedging relationships affected by changes in the interest rates used for discounting cash flows, computing variation margin settlements, and calculating price alignment interest in connection with reference rate\nreform activities under way in global financial markets. The ASU is effective upon issuance and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof. \n  94 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01,\nInvestments—Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)—Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815. The ASU is\nbased on a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force and is expected to increase comparability in accounting for these transactions. ASU 2016-01 made targeted improvements to accounting for financial\ninstruments, including providing an entity the ability to measure certain equity securities without a readily determinable fair value at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Among other topics, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting. The ASU\nis effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows,\nor presentation thereof.  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses,\nwhich changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and\nother instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking “expected loss” model that will replace today’s “incurred loss” model and generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses.\nFor available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to current practice, except that the losses will\nbe recognized as an allowance. Subsequent to issuing ASU 2016-13, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial\nInstruments—Credit Losses, for the purpose of clarifying certain aspects of ASU 2016-13. ASU 2018-19 has the same effective date and transition requirements as\nASU 2016-13. In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives\nand Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which is effective with the adoption of ASU 2016-13. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial\nInstruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), which is also effective with the adoption of ASU 2016-13. In October 2019, the FASB voted to delay the implementation date for certain companies, including\nthose, such as Salem, that qualify as a smaller reporting company under SEC rules, until January 1, 2023. We will adopt this ASU on its effective date of January 1, 2023. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact\non our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof.  NOTE 3. RECENT TRANSACTIONS \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed or entered into the following transactions: \nDebt Transactions  On April 7, 2020, we amended the\nAsset Based Loan Facility to increase the advance rate on eligible accounts receivable from 85% to 90% and to extend the maturity date from May 19, 2022 to March 1, 2024. The April 7, 2020 amendment allows for an alternative benchmark\nrate that may include SOFR due to LIBOR being scheduled to be discontinued at the end of calendar year 2021.  We completed repurchases of\n$3.5 million of the 6.75% Senior Secured Notes (“Notes”) for $3.4 million in cash, recognizing a net gain of $49,000 after adjusting for bond issuance costs as detailed in Note 12 – Long-Term Debt. \nEquity Transactions  Distributions of $0.7 million\n($0.025 per share) were declared and paid in March 2020 based upon our Board of Directors’ (“Board”) then current assessment of our business as detailed in Note 19 – Equity Transactions. \n  95 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAcquisitions \nOn September 15, 2020, we acquired the Hyper Pixels Media website and related assets for $1.1 million in cash. We paid $0.4 million in cash upon\nclosing with deferred payments of $0.4 million due January 31, 2021 and $0.3 million due September 15, 2021. We recorded goodwill of approximately $0.1 million associated with the expected synergies to be realized upon\ncombining the operations of Journeyboxmedia.com into our digital media platform within Salem Web Network (“SWN”) and from brand loyalty from its existing subscriber base that is not a separately identifiable intangible asset. The\naccompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations reflects the operating results of this entity as of the closing date within our digital media segment. \nA summary of our business acquisitions and asset purchases during the year ended December 31, 2020, none of which were individually or in the aggregate\nmaterial to our Consolidated financial position as of the respective date of acquisition, is as follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Acquisition Date\n  \n Description\n \nTotal Cost\n \n\n \n  \n \n \n(Dollars inthousands)\n \n\n September 15, 2020\n  \nHyper Pixels (business acquisition)\n \n$\n1,108\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n  \n  \n \n\n\n  \n\n \n$\n1,108\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n  \n  \n \n Under the acquisition method of accounting as specified in FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, the total\nacquisition consideration of a business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the transaction. Transactions that do not meet the definition of a business in ASU 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business are recorded as asset purchases. Asset purchases are recognized based on their cost to acquire, including transaction costs.\nThe cost to acquire an asset group is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair value with no goodwill recognized.  Fair\nvalue estimates include the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their expected useful lives based on historical experience, market trends and the impact of any synergies believed to be achieved from the acquisition.\nAcquisitions may include contingent consideration, the fair value of which is estimated as of the acquisition date as the present value of the expected contingent payments as determined using weighted probabilities of the payment amounts. \nWe may retain a third-party appraiser to estimate the fair value of the net assets acquired as of the acquisition date. As part of this valuation and\nappraisal process, the third-party appraiser prepares a report assigning estimated fair values to the various assets acquired. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and require careful consideration and judgment. Management reviews the\nthird-party reports for reasonableness of the assigned values. We believe that these valuations and analysis provide appropriate estimates of the fair value for the net assets acquired as of the acquisition date. \nThe initial valuations for business acquisitions are subject to refinement during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition\ndate. During this measurement period, we may record adjustments to the net assets acquired based on additional information obtained for items that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any adjustments are\nreflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. To date, we have not recorded adjustments to the estimated fair values used in our business acquisition consideration during or after the measurement period. \nProperty and equipment are recorded at the estimated fair value and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Finite-lived\nintangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill, which represents the organizational systems and procedures in place to ensure the effective operation of\nthe entity, may also be recorded and tested for impairment. Costs associated with business acquisitions, such as consulting and legal fees, are expensed as incurred. \n  96 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe following table summarizes the total acquisition consideration for the year ended December 31,\n2020:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n  \nTotal Consideration\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Cash payments made upon closing\n  \n$\n400\n \n\n Deferred payments\n  \n \n700\n \n\n Closing costs accrued for business acquisitions\n  \n \n8\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Total purchase price consideration\n  \n$\n1,108\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n The fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nNet Digital MediaAssets Acquired\n \n\n Assets\n  \n\n\n\n\n Property and equipment\n  \n$\n866\n \n\n Goodwill\n  \n \n66\n \n\n Customer lists and contracts\n  \n \n179\n \n\n Domain and brand names\n  \n \n18\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n\n  \n$\n1,129\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Liabilities\n  \n\n\n\n\n Contract liabilities\n  \n$\n(21\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n\n  \n$\n1,108\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n Divestitures  On\nApril 6, 2020, we sold radio station WBZW-AM and an FM translator construction permit in Orlando, Florida, for $0.2 million in cash. We recognized an estimated\npre-tax loss of approximately $1.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2019, which reflects the sale price as compared to the carrying value of the assets less the estimated closing\ncosts.  Pending Transactions  On September 10,\n2020, we entered an APA to sell radio station WKAT-AM and an FM translator in Miami, Florida, for $3.5 million in cash. We will exit the Miami market upon the close of this transaction. We entered a Local\nMarketing Agreement (“LMA”) under which the buyer will begin programming the station in November 2020. We recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $1.4 million during the three-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2020, which reflects the sale price as compared to the carrying value of the assets sold, the estimated closing costs, and the write-off of the remaining Miami assets as a result of exiting\nthis market. This transaction is subject to the approval of the FCC and is expected to close in the first half of 2021.  On February 5, 2020, we\nentered an APA with Word Broadcasting to sell radio stations WFIA-AM, WFIA-FM and WGTK-AM in Louisville, Kentucky for\n$4.0 million with credits applied from amounts previously paid, including a portion of the monthly fees paid under a Time Brokerage Agreement (“TBA.”) Due to changes in debt markets, the transaction was not funded, and it is uncertain\nwhen, or if, the transaction will close. Word Broadcasting continues to program the stations under a TBA that began in January 2017.  NOTE 4. REVENUE\nRECOGNITION  We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”). ASC 606\nrequires revenue to be recognized when control of the promised goods or services transfers to our \n  97 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ncustomers at an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive. The application of ASC 606 requires us to use significant judgment and estimates when applying a five-step model\napplicable to all revenue streams.  Principal versus Agent Considerations \nWhen another party is involved in providing goods or services to our customer, we apply the principal versus agent guidance in ASC 606 to determine if we are\nthe principal or an agent to the transaction. When we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to our customer, we report revenue gross, as principal. If we do not control the goods or services before they are transferred\nto our customer, revenue is reported net of the fees paid to the other party, as agent.  Contract Assets \nContract Assets—Costs to Obtain a Contract: We capitalize commissions paid to sales personnel in our self-publishing business when customer\ncontracts are signed and advance payment is received. These capitalized costs are recorded as prepaid commission expense in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount capitalized is incremental to the contract and would not have been incurred\nabsent the execution of the customer contract. Commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a contract are expensed at the point in time that related revenue is recognized. Prepaid commission expenses are periodically reviewed for impairment. At\nDecember 31, 2020, our prepaid commission expense was $0.7 million.  Contract Liabilities \nContract liabilities consist of customer advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. We may receive payments from our customers in advance\nof completing our performance obligations. Additionally, new customers, existing customers without approved credit terms and authors purchasing specific self-publishing services, are required to make payments in advance of the delivery of the\nproducts or performance of the services. We record contract liabilities equal to the amount of payments received in excess of revenue recognized, including payments that are refundable if the customer cancels the contract according to the contract\nterms. Contract liabilities were historically recorded under the caption “deferred revenue” and are reported as current liabilities on our consolidated financial statements when the time to fulfill the performance obligations under terms\nof our contracts is less than one year. Long-term contract liabilities represent the amount of payments received in excess of revenue earned, including those that are refundable, when the time to fulfill the performance obligation is greater than\none year. Our long-term liabilities consist of subscriptions with a term of two-years for which some customers have purchased and paid for multiple years. \nSignificant changes in our contract liabilities balances during the period are as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nShort Term\n \n  \nLong-Term\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Balance, beginning of period January 1, 2020\n  \n$\n9,493\n \n  \n$\n1,744\n \n\n Revenue recognized during the period that was included in the beginning balance of contract\nliabilities\n  \n \n(7,096\n) \n  \n \n—\n \n\n Additional amounts recognized during the period\n  \n \n23,727\n \n  \n \n878\n \n\n Revenue recognized during the period that was recorded during the period\n  \n \n(15,225\n) \n  \n \n—\n \n\n Transfers\n  \n \n753\n \n  \n \n(753\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Balance, end of period December 31, 2020\n  \n$\n11,652\n \n  \n \n1,869\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Amount refundable at beginning of period\n  \n$\n9,403\n \n  \n$\n1,744\n \n\n Amount refundable at end of period\n  \n$\n11,607\n \n  \n \n1,869\n \n\n  98 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe expect to satisfy these performance obligations as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nAmount\n \n\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n 2021\n  \n$\n11,652\n \n\n 2022\n  \n \n1,257\n \n\n 2023\n  \n \n328\n \n\n 2024\n  \n \n155\n \n\n 2025\n  \n \n46\n \n\n Thereafter\n  \n \n83\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n \n  \n$13,521\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n Significant Financing Component \nThe length of our typical sales agreement is less than 12 months; however, we may sell subscriptions with a two-year\nterm. The balance of our long-term contract liabilities represents the unsatisfied performance obligations for subscriptions with a remaining term in excess of one year. We review long-term contract liabilities that are expected to be completed in\nexcess of one year to assess whether the contract contains a significant financing component. The balance includes subscriptions that will be satisfied at various dates between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2025. The difference between\nthe promised consideration and the cash selling price of the publications is not significant. Therefore, we have concluded that subscriptions do not contain a significant financing component under ASC 606. \nOur self-publishing contracts may exceed a one-year term due to the length of time for an author to submit and approve\na manuscript for publication. The author may pay for publishing services in installments over the production timeline with payments due in advance of performance. The timing of the transfer of goods and services under self-publishing arrangements\nare at the discretion of the author and based on future events that are not substantially within our control. We require advance payments to provide us with protection from incurring costs for products that are unique and only sellable to the\nauthor. Based on these considerations, we have concluded that our self-publishing contracts do not contain a significant financing component under ASC 606. \nVariable Consideration  Similar to former revenue\nrecognition guidance, we continue to make significant estimates related to variable consideration at the point of sale, including estimates for refunds and product returns. Under ASC 606, estimates of variable consideration are to be recognized\nbefore contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances, including when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of any estimated cumulative revenue will not occur. \nWe enter into agreements under which the amount of revenue we earn is contingent upon the amount of money raised by our customer over the contract term. Our\ncustomer is typically a charity or programmer that purchases blocks of programming time or spots to generate revenue from our audience members. Contract terms can range from a few weeks to a few months, depending the charity or programmer. If the\ncampaign does not generate a pre-determined level of donations or revenue to our customer, the consideration that we expect to be entitled to may vary above a minimum base level per the contract. Historically,\nunder ASC Topic 605, we reported variable consideration as revenue when the amount was fixed and determinable. Under ASC 606, variable consideration is to be estimated using the expected value or the most likely amount to the extent it is probable\nthat a significant reversal will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.  Based on the\nconstraints for using estimates of variable consideration within ASC 606, and our historical experience with these campaigns, we will continue to recognize revenue at the base amount of the campaign with variable consideration recognized when the\nuncertainty of each campaign is resolved. These constraints include: \n  99 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n(1) the amount of consideration received is highly susceptible to factors outside of our influence, specifically the extent to which our audience donates or contributes to our customer or\nprogrammer, (2) the length of time in which the uncertainty about the amount of consideration expected is to be resolved, and (3) our experience has shown these contracts have a large number and broad range of possible outcomes. \nTrade and Barter Transactions  In broadcasting,\ntrade or barter agreements are commonly used to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services. We may enter barter agreements to exchange airtime or digital advertising for goods or services that can be used in our\nbusiness or that can be sold to our audience under Listener Purchase Programs. The terms of these barter agreements permit us to preempt the barter airtime or digital campaign in favor of customers who purchase the airtime or digital campaign for\ncash. The value of these non-cash exchanges is included in revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the goods or services we receive. Each transaction must be reviewed to determine that the products,\nsupplies and/or services we receive have economic substance, or value to us. We record barter operating expenses upon receipt and usage of the products, supplies and services, as applicable. We record barter revenue as advertising spots or digital\ncampaigns are delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Barter revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which\ncase, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency.

Exemptions \nWe elected certain practical expedients and policy elections as permitted under ASC 606 as follows: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n We adopted the practical expedient related to not adjusting the promised amount of consideration for the effects\nof a significant financing component if the period between transfer of product and customer payment is expected to be less than one year at the time of contract inception; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n We made the accounting policy election to not assess promised goods or services as performance obligations if\nthey are immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n We made the accounting policy election to exclude sales and similar taxes from the transaction price;\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n We made the accounting policy election to treat shipping and handling costs that occur after control transfers as\nfulfillment activities instead of assessing such activities as separate performance obligations; and   \n\n\n \n•\n \n We adopted the practical expedient not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts\nwith an original expected length of one year or less. \n  100

summary of each of our revenue streams under ASC 606 is as follows: \nBlock Programming. We recognize revenue from the sale of blocks of airtime to program producers that typically range from 121/2, 25 or 50-minutes of time. We separate block program revenue into three categories, National, Local\nand Infomercial revenue. Our stations are classified by format, including Christian Teaching and Talk, News Talk, Contemporary Christian Music, Spanish Language Christian Teaching and Talk and Business. National and local programming content is\ncomplementary to our station format while infomercials are closely associated with long-form advertisements. Block Programming revenue may include variable consideration for charities and programmers that purchase blocks of airtime to generate\ndonations and contributions from our audience. Block programming revenue is recognized at the time of broadcast, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation.\nProgramming revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. \nSpot Advertising. We recognize revenue from the sale of airtime to local and national advertisers who purchase spot commercials of varying\nlengths. Spot Advertising may include variable consideration for charities and programmers that purchase spots to generate donations and contributions from our audience. Advertising revenue is recognized at the time of broadcast, which represents\nthe point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Advertising revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the advertiser, in which case, revenue is reported net of the\ncommission retained by the agency.  Network Revenue. Network revenue includes the sale of advertising time on our national network\nand fees earned from the syndication of programming on our national network. Network revenue is recognized at the time of broadcast, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance\nobligation. Network revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the customer, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. \nDigital Advertising. We recognize revenue from the sale of banner advertising on our owned and operated websites and on our own and operated\nmobile applications. Each of our radio stations, our digital media entities and certain of our publishing entities have custom websites and mobile applications that generate digital advertising revenue. Digital advertising revenue is recognized at\nthe time that the banner display is delivered, or the number of impressions delivered meets the previously agreed-upon performance criteria, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our\nperformance obligation. Digital advertising revenue is reported on a gross basis unless an agency represents the customer, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. \nBroadcast digital advertising revenue consists of local digital advertising, such as the sale of banner advertisements on our owned and operated websites, the\nsale of advertisements on our own and operated mobile applications, and advertisements in digital newsletters that we produce, as well an national digital advertising, or the sale of custom digital advertising solutions, such as web pages and social\nmedia campaigns, that we offer to our customers. Advertising revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the advertiser, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. \nSalem Surround, our national multimedia advertising agency, offers a comprehensive suite of digital marketing services to develop and execute audience-based\nmarketing strategies for clients on both the national and local level. Salem Surround specializes in digital marketing services for each of our radio stations and websites as well as provides a full-service digital marketing strategy for each of our\nclients. In our role as a digital agency, our sales team provides our customers with integrated digital advertising solutions that optimize the performance of their campaign, which we view as one performance obligation. Our advertising campaigns are\ndesigned to be “white label” agreements between Salem and our advertiser, meaning we provide special care and attention to the details of the campaign. We provide custom digital product offerings, including tools for metasearch,\nretargeting, website design, reputation management, online listing services, and social media marketing. Digital advertising \n  102 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nsolutions may include third-party websites, such as Google or Facebook, which can be included in a digital advertising social media campaign. We manage all aspects of the digital campaign,\nincluding social media placements, review and approval of target audiences, and the monitoring of actual results to make modifications as needed. We may contract directly with a third-party, however, we are responsible for delivering the campaign\nresults to our customer with or without the third-party. We are responsible for any payments due to the third-party regardless of the campaign results and without regard to the status of payment from our customer. We have discretion in setting the\nprice to our customer without input or approval from the third-party. Accordingly, revenue is reported gross, as principal, as the performance obligation is delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer\nthereby completing our performance obligation.  Digital Streaming. We recognize revenue from the sale of advertisements and from the\nplacement of ministry content that is streamed on our owned and operated websites and on our owned and operated mobile applications. Each of our radio stations, our digital media entities and certain publishing entities have custom websites and\nmobile applications that generate streaming revenue. Digital streaming revenue is recognized at the time that the content is delivered, or when the number of impressions delivered meets the previously agreed-upon performance criteria. Delivery of\nthe content represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Streaming revenue is reported on a gross basis unless an agency represents the customer, in which case, revenue is\nreported net of the commission retained by the agency.  Digital Downloads and e-books. We recognize\nrevenue from sale of downloaded materials, including videos, song tracks, sermons, content archives and e-books. Payments for downloaded materials are due in advance of the download, however, the download is\noften instant upon confirmation of payment. Digital download revenue is recognized at the time of download, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Revenue is\nrecorded at the gross amount due from the customer. All sales are final with no allowances made for returns.  Subscriptions. We recognize\nrevenue from the sale of subscriptions for financial publication digital newsletters, digital magazines, podcast subscriptions for on-air content, and subscriptions to our print magazine. Subscription terms\ntypically range from three months to two years, with a money-back guarantee for the first 30 days. Refunds after the first 30-day period are considered on a pro-rata\nbasis based on the number of publications issued and delivered. Payments are due in advance of delivery and can be made in full upon subscribing or in quarterly installments. Cash received in advance of the subscription term, including amounts that\nare refundable, is recorded in contract liabilities. Revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term at the point in time that each publication is transmitted or shipped, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the\ncustomer thereby completing our performance obligation. Revenue is reported net of estimated cancellations, which are based on our experience and historical cancellation rates during the cancellable period. \nBook Sales. We recognize revenue from the sale of books upon shipment, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the\ncustomer thereby completing the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded at the gross amount due from the customer, net of estimated sales returns and allowances based on our historical experience. Major new title releases represent a significant\nportion of the revenue in the current period. Print-based consumer books are sold on a fully returnable basis. We do not record assets or inventory for the value of returned books as they are considered used regardless of the condition returned. Our\nexperience with unsold or returned books is that their resale value is insignificant and they are often destroyed or disposed of.  e-Commerce. We recognize revenue from the sale of products sold through our digital platform. Payments for products are due in advance shipping. We record a contract liability when we receive customer\npayments in advance of shipment. The time frame from receipt of payment to shipment is typically one business day based on the time that an order is placed as compared to fulfillment. E-Commerce revenue is\nrecognized at the time of shipment, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our \n  103 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nperformance obligation. Revenue is reported net of estimated returns, which are based on our experience and historical return rates. Returned products are recorded in inventory if they are\nunopened and re-saleable with a corresponding reduction in the cost of goods sold.  Self-Publishing\nFees. We recognize revenue from self-publishing services through Salem Author Services (“SAS”), including book publishing and support services to independent authors. Services include book cover design, interior layout, printing,\ndistribution, marketing services and editing for print books and eBooks. As each book and related support services are unique to each author, authors must make payments in advance of the performance. Payments are typically made in installments over\nthe expected production timeline for each publication. We record contract liabilities equal to the amount of payments received, including those amounts that are fully or partially refundable. Contract liabilities were historically recorded under the\ncaption “deferred revenue” and are reported as current liabilities or long-term liabilities on our consolidated financial statements based on the time to fulfill the performance obligations under terms of the contract. Refunds are limited\nbased on the percentage completion of each publishing project.  Revenue is recognized upon completion of each performance obligation, which represents the\npoint in time that control of the product is transferred to the author, thereby completing our performance obligation. Revenue is recorded at the net amount due from the author, including discounts based on the service package. \nAdvertising—Print. We recognize revenue from the sale of print magazine advertisements. Revenue is recognized upon delivery of the print\nmagazine which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing the performance obligation. Revenue is reported on a gross basis unless an agency represents the customer, in which case, revenue is reported\nnet of the commission retained by the agency.  Other Revenue. Other revenue include various sources, such as event revenue, listener\npurchase programs, talent fees for on-air hosts, rental income for studios and towers, production services, and shipping and handling fees. We recognize event revenue, including fees earned for ticket sales\nand sponsorships, when the event occurs, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Revenue for all other products and services is recorded as the products or\nservices are delivered or performed, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Other revenue is reported on a gross basis unless an agency represents the customer,\nin which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency.  NOTE 5.

We periodically review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. This review requires us to estimate the fair value of the assets\nusing significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value, including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions\nand estimates we used, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. There were no indications of impairment during the period ended December 31, 2020. \nNOTE 7. OPERATING AND FINANCE LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS \nLeasing Transactions  Our leased assets include offices\nand studios, transmitter locations, antenna sites, towers, tower sites, and land. Our lease portfolio has terms remaining from less than one-year up to twenty years. Many of these leases contain options under\nwhich we can extend the term from five to twenty years, the exercise of which is at our sole discretion. Renewal options are excluded from our calculation of lease liabilities unless we are reasonably assured to exercise the renewal option. Our\nlease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. We lease certain properties from our principal stockholders or from trusts and partnerships created for the benefit of the principal stockholders and their\nfamilies. These leases are designated as Related Party leases in the details provided. We are obligated to pay taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges under a majority of our lease agreements. \nOperating leases are reflected on our balance sheet within operating lease ROU assets and the related current and\nnon-current operating lease liabilities. ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from lease\nagreement. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date, or the date on which the lessor makes the underlying asset available for use, based upon the present value of the lease payments over the respective lease\nterm. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, subject to any changes in the lease or expectation regarding the lease terms. Variable lease costs, such as common area maintenance, property taxes and insurance, are\nexpensed as incurred. \n  105 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDue to the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we\nbegan negotiating with landlords in early 2020 to obtain rent concessions to improve our short-term liquidity. In some instances, the renegotiations have led to agreements with landlords for rent abatements or rental deferrals. In accordance with\nthe FASB’s recent Staff Q&A regarding rent concessions related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will not apply the lease modification guidance under ASC 842 to rent concessions that result\nin the total payments required under the modified contract that are substantially the same as or less than total payments required by the original contract. If other terms of the lease are changed or renegotiated in connection with the concession\nprocess, then the changes will be treated as a modification in accordance with ASC 842.  For qualifying rent abatement concessions, we recorded negative\nlease expense for abatement during the period of relief. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized negative lease expense related to rent abatement concessions of $0.3 million. Additionally, deferred cash payments of\n$0.7 million remained at December 31, 2020 that are reported in short-term and long-term operating lease liabilities as applicable based on repayment terms that range from one year through December 2024. \nBalance Sheet  The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in\nrecording a non-cash transitional adjustment to operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities of $65.0 million and $74.4 million, respectively. The difference between the operating lease\nROU assets and operating lease liabilities at transition represented existing deferred rent expense and prepaid rent that was derecognized upon adoption. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded additional ROU assets and\ncorresponding lease liabilities of $4.2 million.

BROADCAST LICENSES \nWe account for broadcast licenses in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.” We do not amortize broadcast\nlicenses, but rather test for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the value may be impaired. In the case of our broadcast radio stations, we would not be able to operate the properties without the related\nbroadcast license for each property. Broadcast licenses are renewed with the FCC every eight years for a nominal fee that is expensed as incurred. We continually monitor our stations’ compliance with the various regulatory requirements that are\nnecessary for the FCC renewal and all of our broadcast licenses have been renewed. We expect all of our broadcast licenses to be renewed in the future and therefore, we consider our broadcast licenses to be indefinite-lived intangible assets. We are\nnot aware of any legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our broadcast licenses. The weighted-average period before the next renewal of our broadcasting licenses is 6.5 years. \nThe following table presents the changes in broadcasting licenses that include acquisitions and divestitures of radio stations and FM translators as described\nin Note 3 – Recent Transactions.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n2019\n \n  \n2020\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Balance, beginning of period before cumulative loss on impairment\n  \n$\n484,691\n \n  \n$\n441,143\n \n\n Accumulated loss on impairment\n  \n \n(108,375\n) \n  \n \n(103,285\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Balance, beginning of period after cumulative loss on impairment\n  \n \n376,316\n \n  \n \n337,858\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Acquisitions of radio stations\n  \n \n617\n \n  \n \n—  \n \n\n Acquisitions of FM translators and construction permits\n  \n \n35\n \n  \n \n—\n \n\n Capital Projects\n  \n \n300\n \n  \n \n—\n \n\n Disposition of radio stations and FM translators\n  \n \n(36,502\n) \n  \n \n(1,091\n) \n\n Impairments based on the estimated fair value of broadcast licenses\n  \n \n(2,908\n) \n  \n \n(16,994\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Balance, end of period after cumulative loss on impairment\n  \n$\n337,858\n \n  \n$\n319,773\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Balance, end of period before cumulative loss on impairment\n  \n$\n441,143\n \n  \n$\n440,052\n \n\n Accumulated loss on impairment\n  \n \n(103,285\n) \n  \n \n(120,279\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Balance, end of period after cumulative loss on impairment\n  \n$\n337,858\n \n  \n$\n319,773\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n  108 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBroadcast Licenses Impairment Test \nWe perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, which coincides with our budget and planning process for the upcoming year.\nThe unit of accounting we use to test broadcast licenses is the cluster level, which we define as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market, sharing the same building and equipment, and managed by a single general manager.\nThe cluster level is the lowest level for which discrete financial information and cash flows are available and the level reviewed by management to analyze operating results. \nThe first step of our impairment testing is to perform a qualitative assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that a broadcast license is impaired.\nThis qualitative assessment requires significant judgment when considering the events and circumstances that may affect the estimated fair value of our broadcast licenses. We review the significant assumptions and key estimates applicable to our\nprior year estimated fair value calculations to assess if events and circumstances have occurred that could affect these assumptions and key estimates. We also review internal benchmarks and the economic performance for each market cluster to assess\nif it is more likely than not that impairment exists.  As part of our qualitative assessment, we calculate the excess fair value, or the amount by which\nour prior year estimated fair value exceeds the current year carrying value. Based on our analysis and review, including the financial performance of each market, we believe that a 25% excess fair value margin is a reasonable benchmark for our\nqualitative analysis. Markets with an excess fair value of 25% or more, which have had no significant changes in the prior year assumptions and key estimates, are not likely to be impaired. \nOf the 16 markets for which an independent third-party fair value appraisal was obtained in the prior year, one market was sold, leaving 15 markets applicable\nto the current year. The table below presents the percentage within a range by which our prior year start-up income estimated fair value exceeds the current year carrying value of our broadcasting licenses:\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nGeographic Market Clusters as of December 31, 2020\n \n\n \n  \nPercentage Range By Which 2019 Estimated Fair ValueExceeds 2020 Carrying Value\n \n\n \n  \n£ 25%\n \n  \n>26%-50%\n \n  \n>51% to 75%\n \n  \n> +than 76%\n \n\n Number of accounting units\n  \n \n4\n \n  \n \n8\n \n  \n \n2\n \n  \n \n1\n \n\n Broadcast license carrying value(in thousands)\n  \n$\n92,983\n \n  \n$\n44,670\n \n  \n$\n27,465\n \n  \n$\n6,092\n \n We performed interim reviews of broadcast licenses in 11 markets during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and the quarter\nended September 30, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting stay-at-home orders that adversely impacted\nrevenue. These 11 markets were tested based on the excess fair value percentages noted in the most recent testing period. While we have seen improvements in revenue from the lowest point in 2020, the improvement has been slower than originally\nexpected due to extended and reinstated stay-at-home orders that unfavorably impacted the economy. We believe that revenue will continue to recover as restrictions are\nlifted and economic activity increases.  We engaged Bond & Pecaro, an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm, to assist us with\ndetermining the enterprise value of 11 of our market clusters at March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020. Based on our review and analysis, we determined that the carrying value of broadcast licenses in 7 of our market clusters were impaired\nas of the interim testing period ended March 31, 2020. We recorded an impairment charge of $17.0 million to the value of broadcast licenses in Chicago, Cleveland, Louisville, Philadelphia, Portland, Sacramento and Tampa as of the interim\ntesting period ended March 31, 2020. The impairment charges were driven by decreases in projected revenue due to the current estimated impact of COVID-19 and an increase in the WACC. We believe that these\nfactors are indicative of trends in the industry as a whole and not unique to our company or operations. There were no impairment charges recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2020. \n  109 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe results of our interim impairment reviews were as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Market Cluster\n  \nExcess Fair ValueMarch 31, 2020 Estimate\n \n \nExcess Fair ValueSeptember 30, 2020 Estimate\n \n\n Boston, MA\n  \n \n4.8\n% \n \n \n5.6\n% \n\n Chicago, IL\n  \n \n(9.0\n%) \n \n \n8.5\n% \n\n Cleveland, OH\n  \n \n(18.4\n%) \n \n \n6.5\n% \n\n Dallas, TX\n  \n \n8.5\n% \n \n \n11.8\n% \n\n Louisville, KY\n  \n \n(21.8\n%) \n \n \n13.8\n% \n\n New York, NY\n  \n \n7.3\n% \n \n \n15.9\n% \n\n Philadelphia, PA\n  \n \n(13.1\n%) \n \n \n5.1\n% \n\n Portland, OR\n  \n \n(14.8\n%) \n \n \n10.1\n% \n\n Sacramento, CA\n  \n \n(9.6\n%) \n \n \n4.6\n% \n\n San Francisco, CA\n  \n \n1.2\n% \n \n \n7.0\n% \n\n Tampa, FL\n  \n \n(28.0\n%) \n \n \n20.5\n% \n We included these 11 markets in our annual testing based on the excess fair value from our interim testing that was less than\n25% as follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nGeographic Market Clusters as December 31, 2020\n \n\n \n \nPercentage Range By Which March 2020 EstimatedFair Value Exceeds 2020 Carrying Value\n \n\n \n \n£ 25%\n \n \n>26%-50%\n \n \n>51% to 75%\n \n \n> +than 76%\n \n\n Number of accounting units\n \n \n11\n \n \n \n—  \n \n \n \n—  \n \n \n \n—  \n \n\n Broadcast license carrying value (in thousands)\n \n$\n188,858\n \n \n$\n—  \n \n \n$\n—  \n \n \n$\n—  \n \n The second part of our qualitative assessment consists of a review of the financial operating results for each market cluster.\nRadio stations are often sold on the basis of a multiple of projected cash flow, or Station Operating Income (“SOI”) defined as net broadcast revenue less broadcast operating expenses. See Item 6 – Selected Financial Data within this\nannual report for information on SOI, a non-GAAP measure. Numerous trade organizations and analysts review these radio station sales to track SOI multiples applicable to each transaction. Based on published\nreports and analysis of market transactions, we believe industry benchmarks to be in the six to seven times cash flow range. We elected an SOI benchmark of four as a reasonable indicator of fair value. Based on this qualitative review, we identified\nseven markets subject to further testing and six markets selected that were not tested in the prior for a total of 13 additional markets.  The table below\nshows the percentage within a range by which our estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses for these 13 market clusters:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nGeographic Market Clusters as of December 31, 2020\n \n\n \n \nTested due to SOI Multiple and length of time fromprior valuation – Percentage Range by Which PriorValuation Exceeded 2020 Carrying Value\n \n\n \n \n£25%\n \n \n>26%-50%\n \n \n>51% to 75%\n \n \n>+than 76%\n \n\n Number of accounting units\n \n \n—  \n \n \n \n3\n \n \n \n2\n \n \n \n8\n \n\n Broadcast license carrying value (in thousands)\n \n$\n—  \n \n \n \n13,373\n \n \n \n8,150\n \n \n \n63,869\n \n Based on this assessment, we engaged Bond & Pecaro, an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm, to\nassist us with determining the enterprise value of 24 of our market clusters. The estimated fair value of each market cluster was determined using the Greenfield Method, a form of the income approach. The premise of the Greenfield Method is that the\nvalue of a broadcast license is equivalent to a hypothetical start-up in which the only asset owned by the station as of the valuation date is the broadcast license. This approach eliminates factors that are\nunique to our operation of the station, including its format and historical financial performance. The method then assumes the entity has to purchase, build, or rent all of the other assets needed to operate a\n\n  110 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ncomparable station to the one in which the broadcast license is being utilized as of the valuation date. Cash flows are estimated and netted against all\nstart-up costs, expenses and investments necessary to achieve a normalized and mature state of operations, thus reflecting only the cash flows directly attributable to the broadcast license. A multi-year\ndiscounted cash flow approach is then used to determine the net present value of these cash flows to derive an indication of fair value. For cash flows beyond the projection period, a terminal value is calculated using the Gordon constant growth\nmodel and long-term industry growth rate assumptions based on long-term industry growth and Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) inflation rates.  The\nprimary assumptions used in the Greenfield Method are:   \n\n\n \n(1)\n gross operating revenue in the station’s designated market area, \n \n\n\n \n(2)\n normalized market share, \n \n\n\n \n(3)\n normalized profit margin, \n \n\n\n \n(4)\n duration of the “ramp-up” period to reach normalized\noperations, (which was assumed to be three years),   \n\n\n \n(5)\n estimated start-up costs (based on market size), \n \n\n\n \n(6)\n ongoing replacement costs of fixed assets and working capital, \n \n\n\n \n(7)\n the calculations of yearly net free cash flows to invested capital; and \n \n\n\n \n(8)\n amortization of the intangible asset, or the broadcast license. \nThe assumptions used reflect those of a hypothetical market participant and not necessarily the actual or projected results of Salem. The key estimates and\nassumptions used in the start-up income valuation for the broadcast licenses tested in each period were as follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Broadcast Licenses\n \nDecember 31, 2019\n \nMarch 31, 2020\n \nSeptember 30, 2020\n \nDecember 31, 2020\n\n Risk-adjusted discount rate\n \n9.0%\n \n9.5%\n \n8.5%\n \n8.5%\n\n Operating profit margin ranges\n \n4.0% - 33.8%\n \n4.6% - 33.8%\n \n4.3% - 33.3%\n \n4.2% - 31.0%\n\n Long-term revenue growth rates\n \n0.7% - 1.1%\n \n0.8% - 1.1%\n \n0.2% - 1.1%\n \n0.4% - 0.9%\n The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) developed based on data from\nsame or similar industry participants and publicly available market data as of the measurement date.

The discounted cash flow analysis utilizes a five to ten-year projection period to derive operating cash flow projections from a market participant view. We\nmake certain assumptions regarding future revenue growth based on industry market data, historical performance and our expectations of future performance. We also make assumptions regarding working capital requirements and ongoing capital\nexpenditures for fixed assets. Future net free cash flows are calculated on a debt free basis and discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate. The terminal year value is calculated using the Gordon constant growth method and\nlong-term growth rate assumptions based on long-term industry growth and GDP inflation rates. The resulting fair value estimates, net of any interest bearing debt, are then compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit’s net assets.\n The first step of our impairment testing is to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if events and circumstances have occurred that indicate it\nis more likely than not that the fair value of the assets, including goodwill, are less than their carrying values. We review the significant inputs used in our prior year fair value estimates to determine if any changes to those inputs should be\nmade. We estimate the fair value using a market approach and compare the estimated fair value of each entity to its carrying value, including goodwill. Under the market approach, we apply a multiple of four to each entities operating income to\nestimate the fair value. We believe that a multiple of four is a reasonable indicator of fair value as in Note 8, Broadcast Licenses.  If the results of\nour qualitative assessment indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying value, we perform a second quantitative review of the reporting unit. We engage an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm to\nassist us with determining the enterprise value as part of this quantitative review.  Goodwill—Broadcast Markets \nThe unit of accounting we use to test goodwill associated with our radio stations is the cluster level, which we define as a group of radio stations operating\nin the same geographic market, sharing the same building and equipment and managed by a single general manager. The cluster level is the lowest level for which discrete financial information and cash flows are available and the level reviewed by\nmanagement to analyze operating results. Four of our 31 market clusters have goodwill associated with them as of our annual testing period ended December 31, 2020. \nThe key estimates and assumptions used for our enterprise valuations were as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Broadcast Markets Enterprise Valuations\n  \nDecember 31, 2019\n  \nDecember 31, 2020\n\n Risk-adjusted discount rate\n  \n9.0%\n  \n8.5%\n\n Operating profit margin ranges\n  \n(31.1%) - 38.7%\n  \n(11.4%) - 41.5%\n\n Long-term revenue growth rates\n  \n0.7% -0.9%\n  \n0.5% - 0.8%\n The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the WACC developed based on data from same or similar industry participants and\npublicly available market data as of the measurement date.  Based on our qualitative review, we tested four market clusters for impairment of goodwill. We\nengaged Bond & Pecaro, an independent appraisal and valuation firm, to assist us in estimating the enterprise of value our market clusters to test goodwill for impairment. The enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are\ninstalled as part of an operating business rather than as a hypothetical start-up. The analysis includes both an income and cost approach to valuation. The income approach uses a discounted cash flow\nprojection while the cost approach, or “stick” value of the underlying assets is used. \n  113 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBased on our review and analysis, we determined that no impairment charges were necessary to the carrying\nvalue of our broadcast market goodwill as of the annual testing period ended December 31, 2020.

The financial\nstatements for Townhall.com® reflect the operating results for each of our conservative opinion websites.

Regnery® Publishing\nis a book publisher based in Washington DC that operates from a stand-alone facility under one general manager, with operating results and cash flows of reported at the entity level. Salem Author Services operates from a stand-alone facility in\nOrlando, Florida under one general manager who is responsible for the operating results and cash flows. Singing News® produces and distributes a print magazine. The entity level is the\nlevel reviewed by management and the lowest level for which discrete financial information is available.  We performed an interim review of goodwill\nduring the first quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting stay-at-home orders that began to adversely\nimpact revenue. We assessed a variety of factors, including media industry forecasts for the remainder of 2020 and the amount by which the prior estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value including goodwill. Based on our review and analysis,\nwe recorded an impairment charge of $0.3 million, including a $0.1 million charge to the carrying value of goodwill associated with Salem Author Services. The impairment charge was driven by a decrease in operating margins due to the\nimpact of COVID-19 on revenue and an increase in the WACC. We believe that these factors are indicative of trends in the industry as a whole and not unique to our company or operations. \nTwo of our publishing entities have goodwill associated with them as of our annual testing period ended December 31, 2020. We tested one of these\nentities because it had not been tested in the prior year and we tested the other entity based on the amount by which the prior estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value. We engaged Bond & Pecaro, an independent appraisal and\nvaluation firm, to assist us in estimating the enterprise of value this publishing entity to test goodwill for impairment. The enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are installed as part of an operating business rather than as a\nhypothetical start-up.

OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS \nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of mastheads, or the graphic elements that identify our publications to readers and advertisers. These include\ncustomized typeset page headers, section headers, and column graphics as well as other name and identity stylized elements within the body of each publication. We are not aware of any legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially\nlimit the useful life of our mastheads. We account for mastheads in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. We do not amortize mastheads, but rather test for impairment annually or more frequently if events or\ncircumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.  We performed an interim review of mastheads during the three months ended March 31, 2020 due\nto the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting stay-at-home orders that began to adversely impact revenue. We assessed a variety of\nfactors, including media industry forecasts and the amount by which the prior estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value. The results of our interim impairment analysis are described further below. \nImpairment testing requires estimates of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. We believe that these fair value estimates are critical\naccounting estimates as the value is significant in relation to our total assets and the estimates incorporate variables and assumptions based on our experiences and judgment about our future operating performance. Fair value measurements use\nsignificant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value, including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and\nestimates used in our estimates, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. The unobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” as Level 3 inputs\ndiscussed in detail in Note 13 – Fair Value Measurements.  For the interim testing, we engaged Bond & Pecaro, an independent appraisal and\nvaluation firm, to assist us in estimating the fair value of mastheads using a Relief from Royalty method, a form of the income approach. The Relief from Royalty method estimates the fair value of mastheads through use of a discounted cash flow\nmodel that incorporates a hypothetical “royalty rate” that a third-party owner would be willing to pay in lieu of owning the asset. The royalty rate is based on observed royalty rates for comparable assets as of the measurement date. We\nadjust the selected royalty rate to account for a percentage of the royalty fee that could be attributed to the use of other intangibles, such as goodwill, time in existence, trade secrets and industry expertise. The adjusted royalty rate represents\nthe royalty fee remaining that could be attributed to the use of the masthead only.  Pre-tax royalty income is\nbased on a 10-year revenue forecast and assumed to carry on into perpetuity. Revenue beyond the projection period (terminal year) is based on estimated long-term industry growth rates. The analysis also\nincorporates the present value of the tax amortization benefit associated with mastheads. The key estimates and assumptions are as follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mastheads\n  \nDecember 31, 2019\n \nMarch 31, 2020\n\n Risk-adjusted discount rate\n  \n10.0%\n \n10.5%\n\n Long-term revenue growth rates\n  \n(4.0%) - (1.0%)\n \n(1.0%) - (25.0%)\n\n Royalty rate\n  \n3.00%\n \n3.00%\n The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the WACC developed based on data from same or similar industry participants and\npublicly available market data as of the measurement date. Based on our review and analysis, we recorded an impairment charge to mastheads of $17,300 as of the annual testing period ended December 31, 2019 and $0.3 million as of the\ninterim testing period ended March 31, 2020. The impairment charges were driven by decreases in the projected long-term revenue growth rates for the print magazine industry and an increase in the WACC. We believe that these factors are\nindicative of trends in the industry as a whole and not unique to our company or operations. The impairment charge during the three months ended March 31, 2020 reduced the value of our mastheads to zero eliminating subsequent testing. \n  116 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNOTE 11.

LONG-TERM DEBT \nSalem Media Group, Inc. has no independent assets or operations, the subsidiary guarantees relating to certain debt are full and unconditional and joint and\nseveral, and any subsidiaries of Salem Media Group, Inc. other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor. \n  117 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n6.75% Senior Secured Notes \nOn May 19, 2017, we issued the Notes in a private placement. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by our existing subsidiaries (the\n“Subsidiary Guarantors”). The Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per year and mature on June 1, 2024, unless they are earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest initially accrued on the Notes from May 19, 2017 and is payable\nsemi-annually, in cash in arrears, on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2017.  The Notes are secured by a\nfirst-priority lien on substantially all assets of ours and the Subsidiary Guarantors other than the ABL Facility Priority Collateral (as described below) (the “Notes Priority Collateral”). There is no direct lien on our FCC licenses to\nthe extent prohibited by law or regulation (other than the economic value and proceeds thereof).  The Notes were redeemable, in whole or in part, at any\ntime on or before June 1, 2020 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus a “make-whole” premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. At any time on or\nafter June 1, 2020, the Notes are redeemable at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount to be redeemed) set forth in the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption\ndate.  The indenture relating to the Notes (the “Indenture”) contains covenants that, among other things and subject in each case to certain\nspecified exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders; (iii) make investments;\n(iv) create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; (v) merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets; (vi) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (vii) sell or\ntransfer assets.  The Indenture provides for the following events of default (each, an “Event of Default”): (i) default in payment of principal\nor premium on the Notes at maturity, upon repurchase, acceleration, optional redemption or otherwise; (ii) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the Notes; (iii) the failure by us or certain restricted subsidiaries to comply with\nother agreements in the Indenture or the Notes, in certain cases subject to notice and lapse of time; (iv) the failure of any guarantee by certain significant Subsidiary Guarantors to be in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance\nwith its terms, subject to notice and lapse of time; (v) certain accelerations (including failure to pay within any grace period) of other indebtedness of ours or any restricted subsidiary if the amount accelerated (or so unpaid) is at least\n$15 million; (vi) certain judgments for the payment of money in excess of $15 million; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us or any significant subsidiary; and (viii) certain defaults with\nrespect to any collateral having a fair market value in excess of $15 million. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal of\nthe Notes and any accrued interest on the Notes to be due and payable immediately, subject to remedy or cure in certain cases. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Notes being due and payable\nimmediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under the Indenture. \nBased on the balance of the Notes currently outstanding, we are required to pay $14.6 million per year in interest on the Notes. As of December 31,\n2020, accrued interest on the Notes was $1.2 million.  We incurred debt issuance costs of $6.3 million that were recorded as a reduction of the\ndebt proceeds that are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the life of the Notes using the effective interest method. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.7 million and\n$0.9 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs associated with the Notes was amortized to interest expense.  We may from time to time, depending\non market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, seek to repurchase the Notes in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, as market conditions\nwarrant. \n  118 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBased on the then existing market conditions, we completed repurchases of our 6.75% Senior Secured Notes at\namounts less than face value as follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Date\n \n\nPrincipalRepurchased\n \n \n Cash Paid\n \n \n\n% of FaceValue\n \n \n\nBond IssueCosts\n \n \n Net Gain\n \n\n \n \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\nJanuary 30, 2020\n \n$\n 2,250\n \n \n$\n 2,194\n \n \n \n97.50\n% \n \n$\n 34\n \n \n$\n 22\n \n\nJanuary 27, 2020\n \n \n1,245\n \n \n \n1,198\n \n \n \n96.25\n% \n \n \n20\n \n \n \n27\n \n\nDecember 27, 2019\n \n \n3,090\n \n \n \n2,874\n \n \n \n93.00\n% \n \n \n48\n \n \n \n167\n \n\nNovember 27, 2019\n \n \n5,183\n \n \n \n4,548\n \n \n \n87.75\n% \n \n \n82\n \n \n \n553\n \n\nNovember 15, 2019\n \n \n3,791\n \n \n \n3,206\n \n \n \n84.58\n% \n \n \n61\n \n \n \n524\n \n\nMarch 28, 2019\n \n \n2,000\n \n \n \n1,830\n \n \n \n91.50\n% \n \n \n37\n \n \n \n134\n \n\nMarch 28, 2019\n \n \n2,300\n \n \n \n2,125\n \n \n \n92.38\n% \n \n \n42\n \n \n \n133\n \n\nFebruary 20, 2019\n \n \n125\n \n \n \n114\n \n \n \n91.25\n% \n \n \n2\n \n \n \n9\n \n\nFebruary 19, 2019\n \n \n350\n \n \n \n319\n \n \n \n91.25\n% \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n24\n \n\nFebruary 12, 2019\n \n \n1,325\n \n \n \n1,209\n \n \n \n91.25\n% \n \n \n25\n \n \n \n91\n \n\nJanuary 10, 2019\n \n \n570\n \n \n \n526\n \n \n \n92.25\n% \n \n \n9\n \n \n \n35\n \n\nDecember 21, 2018\n \n \n2,000\n \n \n \n1,835\n \n \n \n91.75\n% \n \n \n38\n \n \n \n127\n \n\nDecember 21, 2018\n \n \n1,850\n \n \n \n1,702\n \n \n \n92.00\n% \n \n \n35\n \n \n \n113\n \n\nDecember 21, 2018\n \n \n1,080\n \n \n \n999\n \n \n \n92.50\n% \n \n \n21\n \n \n \n60\n \n\nNovember 17, 2018\n \n \n1,500\n \n \n \n1,357\n \n \n \n90.50\n% \n \n \n29\n \n \n \n114\n \n\nMay 4, 2018\n \n \n4,000\n \n \n \n3,770\n \n \n \n94.25\n% \n \n \n86\n \n \n \n144\n \n\nApril 10, 2018\n \n \n4,000\n \n \n \n3,850\n \n \n \n96.25\n% \n \n \n87\n \n \n \n63\n \n\nApril 9, 2018\n \n \n2,000\n \n \n \n1,930\n \n \n \n96.50\n% \n \n \n43\n \n \n \n27\n \n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n\n\n \n$\n38,659\n \n \n$\n35,586\n \n \n\n\n\n \n$\n706\n \n \n$\n2,367\n \n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility \nOn May 19, 2017, the company entered into the ABL Facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) by and among us and our\nsubsidiaries party thereto as borrowers, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and lead arranger, and the lenders that are parties thereto. We used the proceeds of the ABL Facility, together with the net proceeds from the\nNotes offering, to repay outstanding borrowings under our previously existing senior credit facilities, and related fees and expenses. Current proceeds from the ABL Facility are used to provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate\npurposes, including permitted acquisitions.  The ABL Facility is a five-year $30.0 million revolving credit facility due March 1, 2024, which\nincludes a $5.0 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a $7.5 million subfacility for swingline loans. All borrowings under the ABL Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to a base rate or LIBOR plus a spread. The spread,\nwhich is based on an availability-based measure, ranges from 0.50% to 1.00% for base rate borrowings and 1.50% to 2.00% for LIBOR borrowings. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate may increase by 2.00% per annum. Amounts outstanding under\nthe ABL Facility may be paid and then reborrowed at our discretion without penalty or premium. Additionally, we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance from 0.25% to 0.375% per year based on the level of borrowings. \nOn October 20, 2020, we entered into a fourth amendment to our ABL Facility that provides a one-time waiver with\nrespect to the current covenant testing period allowing the covenant trigger event date be the first day after the availability on the ABL Facility had equaled or exceeded (1) 15% of the maximum revolver amount and (2) $4.5 million and a waiver\npermitting our July 2020 financial statements to be issued on or before September 30, 2020 due to delays that were caused by a ransomware attack.  On\nApril 7, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to ABL Facility that increased the advance rate on eligible accounts receivable from 85% to 90% and extended the maturity date from May 19, 2022 to March 1, 2024. The\n\n  119 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nApril 7, 2020 amendment also allows for an alternative benchmark rate that may include SOFR due to LIBOR being scheduled to be discontinued at the end of calendar year 2021. \nAvailability under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of (a) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount\nbased on the value of certain real property. As of December 31, 2020, the amount available under the ABL Facility was $24.2 million of which $5.0 million was outstanding. The ABL Facility has a first-priority lien on our and the\nSubsidiary Guarantors’ accounts receivable, inventory, deposit and securities accounts, certain real estate and related assets (the “ABL Facility Priority Collateral”) and by a second-priority lien on the Notes Priority Collateral.\nThere is no direct lien on our FCC licenses to the extent prohibited by law or regulation (other than the economic value and proceeds thereof).  The\nCredit Agreement includes a springing fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0, which is tested during the period commencing on the last day of the fiscal month most recently ended prior to the date on which Availability (as defined in the Credit\nAgreement) is less than the greater of 15% of the Maximum Revolver Amount (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and $4.5 million and continuing for a period of 60 consecutive days after the first day on which Availability exceeds such threshold\namount. The Credit Agreement also includes other negative covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this type, including covenants that, subject to exceptions described in the Credit Agreement, restrict our ability and the ability of our\nsubsidiaries (i) to incur additional indebtedness; (ii) to make investments; (iii) to make distributions, loans or transfers of assets; (iv) to enter into, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any liens, (v) to sell\nassets; (vi) to enter into transactions with affiliates; (vii) to merge or consolidate with, or dispose of all assets to a third party, except as permitted thereby; (viii) to prepay indebtedness; and (ix) to pay dividends. \nThe Credit Agreement provides for the following events of default: (i) default for non-payment of any principal\nor letter of credit reimbursement when due or any interest, fees or other amounts within five days of the due date; (ii) the failure by any borrower or any subsidiary to comply with any covenant or agreement contained in the Credit Agreement or\nany other loan document, in certain cases subject to applicable notice and lapse of time; (iii) any representation or warranty made pursuant to the Credit Agreement or any other loan document is incorrect in any material respect when made;\n(iv) certain defaults of other indebtedness of any borrower or any subsidiary of indebtedness of at least $10 million; (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to any borrower or any subsidiary; (vi) certain\njudgments for the payment of money of $10 million or more; (vii) a change of control; and (viii) certain defaults relating to the loss of FCC licenses, cessation of broadcasting and termination of material station contracts. If an\nevent of default occurs and is continuing, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may accelerate the amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we\nremain, in compliance with all of the covenants under Credit Agreement.  We incurred debt issue costs of $0.9 million that were recorded as an asset\nand are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the term of the ABL Facility using the effective interest method. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.2 million of\ndebt issuance costs associated with the ABL Facility was amortized to interest expense. At December 31, 2020, the blended interest rate on amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility was 2.5%. \nWe report outstanding balances on the ABL Facility as short-term regardless of the maturity date based on use of the ABL Facility to fund ordinary and\ncustomary operating cash needs with frequent repayments. We believe that our borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service requirements for at\nleast the next twelve months. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Agreement. \n  120 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSummary of long-term debt obligations \nLong-term debt consisted of the following:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nAs of December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n2019\n \n  \n2020\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n 6.75% Senior Secured Notes\n  \n$\n219,836\n \n  \n$\n216,341\n \n\n Less unamortized debt issuance costs based on imputed interest rate of 7.08%\n  \n \n(3,368\n) \n  \n \n(2,577\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n 6.75% Senior Secured Notes net carrying value\n  \n \n216,468\n \n  \n \n213,764\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility principal outstanding\n  \n \n12,426\n \n  \n \n5,000\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Long-term debt less unamortized debt issuance costs\n  \n \n228,894\n \n  \n \n218,764\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Less current portion\n  \n \n(12,426\n) \n  \n \n(5,000\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Long-term debt less unamortized debt issuance costs, net of current portion\n  \n$\n216,468\n \n  \n$\n213,764\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n In addition to the outstanding amounts listed above, we also have interest payments related to our long-term debt as follows\nas of December 31, 2020:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n $5.0 million under the ABL Facility, with interest spread ranging from Base Rate plus 0.50% to 1.00% for\nbase rate borrowings and LIBOR plus 1.50% to 2.00% for LIBOR borrowings;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n $216.3 million aggregate principal amount of Notes with semi-annual interest payments at an annual rate of\n6.75%; and   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375% per annum on the unused portion of the ABL Facility. \nMaturities of Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations \nPrincipal repayment requirements under all long-term debt agreements outstanding at December 31, 2020 for each of the next five years and thereafter are\nas follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n Amount\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n For the Year Ended December 31,\n  \n\n\n\n\n 2021\n  \n$\n5,000\n \n\n 2022\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n 2023\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n 2024\n  \n \n216,341\n \n\n 2025\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n Thereafter\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n\n  \n$\n221,341\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n NOTE 13. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES \nFair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date.” FASB ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” (“ASC 820”) established a hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability\nutilized in measuring fair value. This framework defines three levels of inputs to the \n  121 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nfair value measurement process and requires that each fair value measurement be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in\nits entirety. The three broad levels of inputs defined by the ASC 820 hierarchy are as follows:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Level 1 Inputs—quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets\nor liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Level 2 Inputs—inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that\nare observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n Level 3 Inputs—unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. These unobservable\ninputs reflect the entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (which might include the\nreporting entity’s own data).  Under ASC 820, a fair value measurement of a nonfinancial asset considers a market\nparticipant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. Therefore, fair value is a market-based\nmeasurement and not an entity-specific measurement. It is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The exit price objective of a fair value measurement applies regardless of the reporting\nentity’s intent and/or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date.  As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value\nof cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued interest approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of such instruments. The carrying amount of the Notes at December 31, 2020\nwas $216.3 million compared to the estimated fair value of $199.0 million, based on the prevailing interest rates and trading activity of our Notes. \nWe have certain assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis that are adjusted to fair value only\nwhen the carrying values exceed the fair values. The categorization of the framework used to price the assets is considered Level 3 due to the subjective nature of the unobservable inputs used when estimating the fair value. \nThe following table summarizes the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nDecember 31, 2020\n \n\n \n  \nCarrying Value onBalance Sheet\n \n  \nFair Value Measurement Category\n \n\n \n  \nLevel 1\n \n  \nLevel 2\n \n  \nLevel 3\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Liabilities:\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n Long-term debt less unamortized debt issuance costs\n  \n$\n218,764\n \n  \n \n—  \n \n  \n$\n201,263\n \n  \n \n—  \n \n NOTE 14. INCOME TAXES  We\nrecognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between our consolidated financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure these deferred\ntax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a change in tax rates in\nincome in the period that includes the date of the change.  For financial reporting purposes, we recorded a valuation allowance of $28.4 million as\nof December 31, 2020 to offset $28.4 million of the deferred tax assets related to the federal net operating loss carryforwards, and $19.7 million of the deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards of\n$15.7 million and \n  122 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nother financial statement accrual assets of $4.0 million, for a total valuation allowance of $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

For financial reporting purposes at December 31, 2019, we had a valuation\nallowance of $8.9 million, net of federal benefit, to offset the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards along with a valuation allowance of $4.1 million to offset the deferred tax assets related to the\nfederal net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of our adjusted cumulative three-year pre-tax book loss as of December 31, 2020, we performed an assessment of positive and negative evidence with\nrespect to the realization of our net deferred tax assets. This assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the availability of carryforwards and estimates of projected future taxable income. The economic\nuncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic provided additional negative evidence that outweighed positive evidence resulting in our conclusion that additional deferred tax assets of $35.1 million related to\nfederal and state net operating loss carryforwards are more likely than not to be not realized. As such, an additional valuation allowance of $35.1 million was recorded, for a total valuation allowance of $48.1 million as of the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020.  The amortization of our indefinite-lived intangible assets for tax purposes, but not for book purposes, creates deferred tax\nliabilities. A reversal of deferred tax liabilities may occur when indefinite-lived intangibles: (1) become impaired; or (2) are sold, which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of\nstations or the entire company in a taxable transaction. Due to the amortization for tax purposes and not book purposes of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, we expect to continue to generate deferred tax liabilities in future periods exclusive\nof any impairment losses in future periods. These deferred tax liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards result in differences between our provision for income tax and cash paid for taxes. \nNOTE 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  The company\nenters into various agreements in the normal course of business that contain minimum guarantees. Minimum guarantees are typically tied to future events, such as future revenue earned in excess of the contractual level. Accordingly, the fair value of\nthese arrangements is zero. \n  124 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe company also records contingent earn-out consideration\nrepresenting the estimated fair value of future liabilities associated with acquisitions that may have additional payments due upon the achievement of certain performance targets. The fair value of the contingent\nearn-out consideration is estimated as of the acquisition date as the present value of the expected contingent payments as determined using weighted probabilities of the expected payment amounts. We review the\nprobabilities of possible future payments to estimate the fair value of any contingent earn-out consideration on a quarterly basis over the earn-out period. Actual\nresults are compared to the estimates and probabilities of achievement used in our forecasts. Should actual results of the acquired business increase or decrease as compared to our estimates and assumptions, the estimated fair value of the\ncontingent earn-out consideration liability will increase or decrease, up to the contracted limit, as applicable. Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent\nearn-out consideration are reflected in our results of operations in the period in which they are identified. Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent\nearn-out consideration may materially impact and cause volatility in our operating results.  The company and its\nsubsidiaries, incident to its business activities, are parties to a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits, arbitration and other claims. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance. The company\nevaluates claims based on what we believe to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The company maintains insurance that may provide coverage for such matters. Consequently, the company is unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of\nmonetary liability or the financial impact with respect to these matters. The company believes, at this time, that the final resolution of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially adversely affect the company’s\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  NOTE 16. STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN \nOur Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) provides for grants of equity-based awards to employees, non-employee directors and officers, and advisors of the company (“Eligible Persons”). The Plan is designed to promote the interests of the company using equity investment interests to attract, motivate,\nand retain individuals.  A maximum of 8,000,000 shares are authorized under the Plan. All awards have restriction periods tied primarily to employment\nand/or service. The Plan allows for accelerated or continued vesting in certain circumstances as defined in the Plan including death, disability, a change in control, and termination or retirement. Our Board, or a committee appointed by our Board,\nhas discretion subject to limits defined in the Plan, to modify the terms of any outstanding award. Awards granted to non-employee directors are made in exchange for their services to the company as directors\nand therefore, the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 505-50 Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees is not applicable. \nUnder the Plan, our Board, or a committee appointed by our Board, may impose restrictions on the exercise of awards during\npre-defined blackout periods.

Incentive and non-qualified stock option awards allow the recipient to purchase shares of our common stock at a set price, not to be less than the closing market price on the date\nof award, for no consideration payable by the recipient. The related number of shares underlying the stock option is fixed at the time of the grant. Options generally vest over a four-year period with a maximum term of five years from the vesting\ndate. In addition, certain management and professional level employees may receive stock option awards upon the commencement of employment.  The Plan also\nallows for awards of restricted stock that contain transfer restrictions under which they cannot be sold, pledged, transferred or assigned until the period specified in the award, generally from one to five years. Restricted stock awards are\nindependent of option grants and are granted at no cost to the recipient other than applicable taxes owed by the recipient. The awards are considered issued and outstanding from the date of grant. \nThe fair value of each award is estimated as of the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected volatility reflects the\nconsideration of the historical volatility of our common stock as determined by the closing price over a six to ten-year term commensurate with the expected term of the award. Expected dividends reflect the\namount of quarterly distributions authorized and declared on our Class A and Class B common stock as of the grant date. The expected term of the awards is based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior.\nThe risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected term of the award are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted. We have used historical data to estimate future forfeiture rates to apply\nagainst the gross amount of compensation expense determined using the valuation model. These estimates have approximated our actual forfeiture rates. \n  126 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the stock options using

SEGMENT DATA \nFASB ASC Topic 280, “Segment Reporting,” requires companies to provide certain information about their operating segments. We have three\noperating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating segments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of senior\nexecutives, assess the performance of each operating segment and determine the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We continually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our business and\nmay make changes as necessary.  We measure and evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that do not include\nallocations of costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury, which are reported as unallocated corporate expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations included in\nthis annual report . We also exclude costs such as amortization, depreciation, taxes and interest expense.  Segment performance, as defined by Salem, is\nnot necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS \nIn January 2021, we applied for $11.2 million in PPP loans available under the CAA for our radio station clusters and our networks. We have received\n$8.4 million in funding and expect to receive the remaining amount in the next several weeks.  On February 4, 2021, we entered into an APA to\nacquire KDIA-AM and KDYA-AM in San Francisco, California for $0.6 million. The purchase is subject to the approval of the FCC and is expected to close in the first\nhalf of 2021.  On January 4, 2021, we granted 100,000 stock options to the President of our New Media division. The fair value of the stock award was\nmeasured based on the grant date market price of our common shares.  Subsequent events reflect all applicable transactions through the date of the filing.\n ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. \nNone.  ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND\nPROCEDURES.  (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. \nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,\nas appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. \nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Exchange Act\n\n  133 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nRule 13a-15(e)). Based upon the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2020, the end of the period covered by this annual report.   \n\n\n(b)\n Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nInternal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:   \n\n\n \n(1)\n Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the assets of the Company;   \n\n\n \n(2)\n Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of managements and directors of the Company; and \n \n\n\n \n(3)\n Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Internal control over financial\nreporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses\nin judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may\nnot be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards\nto reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\nfor the Company. Management has used the framework set forth in the 2013 report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission to\nevaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year. \n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the\nCompany’s fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. \nITEM 9B.

        "Our success depends on the continued contributions from our employees and senior management team. Effective\nsuccession planning is also important for our long-term success. The Nominating and Governance committee of our Board of Directors (“Board”) discusses succession planning annually. The loss of any of our senior management team could harm\nour ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. ",
        "Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic ",
        "In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. The responses by federal, state and local governments to restrict public gatherings and travel rapidly grew to include\nstay-at-home orders, school closures and mandatory restrictions on non-essential businesses and services that has adversely\naffected workforces, certain economies, and financial markets resulting in a significant economic downturn. We experienced declining revenue from advertising, programming, events and book sales. Several advertisers reduced or ceased advertising\nspend due to the outbreak and stay-at-home orders that effectively shut many businesses down. This was particularly true within our broadcast segment, which derives\nsubstantial revenue from local advertisers who have been particularly hard hit due to social distancing and government interventions and in our publishing segment that sells books in retail stores and through live events. ",
        "While this disruption is expected to be temporary, there remains to be considerable uncertainty around the duration. Although advertising revenue continues to\nimprove from the lowest levels experienced during April and May of 2020, it remains significantly below prior years. The exact timing and pace of the recovery has not been determinable as certain markets have reopened, some of which have since\nexperienced a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, resulting in varying degrees of reinstated stay-at-home orders. Due to continuing\nuncertainties regarding the ultimate scope and trajectory of COVID-19’s spread and evolution, it is impossible to predict the total impact that the pandemic will have on our business. If public and\nprivate entities continue to enforce restrictive measures, the material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could persist. Our businesses could also continue to be impacted by the disruptions\nfrom COVID-19 and resulting adverse changes in advertising customers and consumer behavior. ",
        "Future availability\nunder our credit facility is contingent upon our eligible receivable balance, which is negatively impacted by lower revenue and longer days to collect. Availability under our Asset Based Loan Facility (“ABL Facility”) is subject to a\nborrowing base consisting of (a) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount based on the value of certain real property. The maximum amount available under our ABL Facility declined to $24.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2020 from $26.4 million at December 31, 2019, of which $5.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2020 compared to $12.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019. ",
        "In response to these developments, beginning in March 2020, we implemented several measures to reduce costs and conserve cash to ensure that we have adequate\ncash to meet our debt servicing requirements, including: ",
        " ",
        "limiting capital expenditures; ",
        " ",
        "reducing discretionary spending, including travel and entertainment; ",
        " ",
        "eliminating open positions and freezing new hires; ",
        " ",
        "reducing staffing levels; ",
        " ",
        "implementing temporary company-wide pay cuts of 5%, 7.5% or 10% depending on salary level; ",
        " ",
        "furloughing certain employees; ",
        " ",
        "temporarily suspending the company 401(k) match; ",

The CARES Act provides\nopportunities for additional liquidity, loan guarantees, and other government programs to support companies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and their employees. On December 27, 2020, Congress passed the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act (“CAA”) that includes a second relief package, which, among other things, provides for an extension of the Payroll Support Program established by the CARES Act. We have utilized certain benefits of the CARES\nAct, and we may be entitled to benefits under the CAA based on our individual locations, including:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n the deferral of all employer FICA taxes beginning in April 2020 for the remainder of 2020, with 50% payable in\nDecember 2021 and the remainder payable in December 2022;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n relaxation of interest expense deduction limitation for income tax purposes; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Payroll Protection Plan (“PPP”) loans available based on the eligibility determined on a per-location basis of up to $11.2 million on a consolidated basis.  We believe that our customers\nhave benefited from the enhanced benefits provided by the CARES Act, and that they will also benefit from the CAA. The CAA provides for another round of direct payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, education funding, and aid to sectors still\nreeling from the economic fallout of the pandemic. While these measures may benefit many of our customers, we cannot assure you that the implementation of these measures will offset the negative impact of\nCOVID-19 on our customers. If the CAA or any additional stimulus measures are not sufficient to remediate the financial stress on our customers as a result of the pandemic, we may experience ongoing challenges\nin growing and maintain revenue and we may experience an increase in delinquencies that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods. \nWe continue to review and consider any available potential benefit under the CARES Act and the CAA for which we qualify. We cannot predict the manner in which\nsuch benefits or any of the other benefits described herein will be allocated or administered and we cannot assure you that we will be able to access such benefits in a timely manner or at all. If the U.S. government or any other governmental\nauthority agrees to provide such aid under the CARES Act, the CAA, or any other crisis relief assistance it may impose certain requirements on the recipients of the aid, including restrictions on executive officer compensation, dividends, prepayment\nof debt, limitations on debt and other similar restrictions that may apply for a period of time after the aid is repaid or redeemed in full.  Due to the\nadverse economic impact, we reforecast our anticipated results extending through March 2022. Our reforecast includes the impact of certain of these cost-cutting measures. Based on our current and expected economic outlook and our current and\nexpected funding needs, we believe that the borrowing capacity under our current credit facilities, together with cash on hand, allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund necessary capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service\nrequirements for at least the next twelve months, including the working capital deficit at December 31, 2020. Based on our current assessment, we believe that we have the ability to meet our obligations as they come due for one year from the\nissuance of this annual report.  Recent Developments \nCyber Incident  On August 7, 2020, we detected a\nransomware attack impacting certain of our operational and information technology systems. We promptly launched an investigation, notified law enforcement and engaged the services of specialized incident response professionals. We have recovered our\nbusiness systems and critical operational \n  6 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ndata. Based on our investigation, we believe the incident has not had a material impact on our business, operations or financial condition. We believe that our cyber insurance coverage is\ncommensurate with our size and the nature of our operations.  Debt Transactions \nOn October 20, 2020, we entered into a fourth amendment to our ABL Facility that provides a one-time waiver with\nrespect to the current covenant testing period allowing the covenant trigger event date to be the first day after the availability on the ABL Facility had equaled or exceeded (1) 15% of the maximum revolver amount and (2) $4.5 million and a\nwaiver permitting our July 2020 financial statements to be issued on or before September 30, 2020 due to delays that were caused by a ransomware attack. \nOn April 7, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to ABL Facility that increased the advance rate on eligible accounts receivable from 85% to 90% and\nextended the maturity date from May 19, 2022 to March 1, 2024. The April 7, 2020 amendment also allows for an alternative benchmark rate that may include SOFR due to LIBOR being scheduled to be discontinued at the end of calendar year\n2021.  During January 2020 we completed repurchases of $3.5 million of the 6.75% Senior Secured Notes (“Notes”) for $3.4 million in\ncash, recognizing a net gain of $49,000 after adjusting for bond issuance costs as detailed in Note 12– Long-Term Debt of our Consolidated Financial Statements. \nEquity Transactions  Distributions of $0.7 million\n($0.025 per share) were declared and paid in March 2020 based upon our Board of Directors’ (“Board”) then current assessment of our business as detailed in Note 19 – Equity Transactions of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n Acquisitions  On September 15, 2020, we\nacquired the Hyper Pixels Media website and related assets for $1.1 million in cash. We paid $0.4 million in cash upon closing with deferred payments of $0.4 million due January 31, 2021 and $0.3 million due\nSeptember 15, 2021. We recorded goodwill of approximately $0.1 million associated with the expected synergies to be realized upon combining the operations into our digital media platform within Salem Web Network (“SWN”) and from\nbrand loyalty from Hyper Pixel Media’s existing subscriber base that is not a separately identifiable intangible asset. The accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations reflects the operating results of this entity as of the closing date\nwithin our digital media segment.  Divestitures  On\nApril 6, 2020, we sold radio station WBZW-AM and an FM translator construction permit in Orlando, Florida, for $0.2 million in cash. We recognized an estimated\npre-tax loss of approximately $1.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2019, which reflects the sale price as compared to the carrying value of the assets less the estimated closing\ncosts.  Pending Transactions  On September 10,\n2020, we entered an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) to sell radio station WKAT-AM and an FM translator in Miami, Florida, for $3.5 million in cash. We will exit the Miami market upon the close\nof this transaction. We entered a Local Marketing Agreement (“LMA”) under which the buyer will begin programming the station in November 2020. We recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of\n$1.4 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, which reflects the sale price as compared to the carrying value of the assets sold, the estimated closing costs, and the write-off\nof the remaining Miami assets as a result of exiting this market. This transaction is subject to the approval of the FCC and is expected to close during the first half of 2021. \n  7 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOn February 5, 2020, we entered an APA with Word Broadcasting to sell radio stations WFIA-AM, WFIA-FM and WGTK-AM in Louisville, Kentucky for $4.0 million with credits applied from amounts previously paid, including\na portion of the monthly fees paid under a Time Brokerage Agreement (“TBA.”) Due to changes in debt markets, the transaction was not funded, and it is uncertain when, or if, the transaction will close. Word Broadcasting continues to\nprogram the stations under a TBA that began in January 2017.  Broadcasting \nOur broadcast segment includes the operating results of our radio stations, broadcast networks, and our national sales agencies including our full-service\ndigital agency, Salem Surround. National companies often prefer to advertise across the United States as an efficient and cost-effective way to reach their target audiences. Our national platform under which we offer radio airtime, digital campaigns\nand print advertisements can benefit national companies by reaching audiences throughout the United States.  Radio Stations \nWe own and/or operate 99 radio stations in 35 markets, including 58 radio stations in 23 of the top 25 markets, consisting of 33 FM radio\nstations and 66 AM radio stations. We also program the Family Talk® Christian-themed talk format station on SiriusXM Channel 131. We are one of only three commercial radio broadcasters\nwith radio stations in all the top 10 markets. We are the sixth largest commercial radio broadcaster in the United States as measured by number of radio stations overall and the third largest operator as measured by number of stations in the top 25\nmarkets.  We program our radio stations in three main formats: (1) Christian Teaching and Talk, (2) News Talk and\n(3) Contemporary Christian Music (“CCM”). Other radio station formats include Spanish language Christian Teaching and Talk, Business, Country, Urban, and Classic Hits. \nChristian Teaching and Talk. We currently program 37 of our radio stations in our foundational format, Christian Teaching and Talk,\nwhich is talk programming emphasizing Christian and family themes. Through this format, a listener can hear Bible teachings and sermons, as well as gain insight to questions related to daily life, such as raising children or religious legal rights\nin education and in the workplace. This format uses block programming time to offer a learning resource and a source of personal support for listeners. Listeners often contact our programmers to donate, ask questions and obtain materials on a\nsubject matter or receive study guides based on what they have learned on the radio.  Block Programming. We recognize revenue from\nthe sale of blocks of airtime to program producers that typically consist of 121/2, 25 or 50-minutes\nof time. We sell blocks of airtime on our Christian Teaching and Talk format stations to a variety of national and local religious and charitable organizations that we believe create compelling radio programs. National programmers, such as\nestablished non-profit religious and educational organizations, typically purchase time on a Monday through Friday basis with supplemental programming blocks available for weekend release. Local programmers,\nsuch as community churches and organizations, typically purchase blocks for weekend releases. Historically, more than 95% of these national religious and charitable organizations renew their annual programming relationships with us. Based on our\nhistorical renewal rates, we believe that block programming provides a steady and consistent source of revenue and cash flows. Our top ten programmers have remained relatively constant and average more than 30 years\non-air with us. Over the last five years, block-programming has generated 40% to 43% of our total net broadcast revenue. \nSatellite Radio. We program SiriusXM Channel 131, the exclusive Christian Teaching and Talk channel on SiriusXM, reaching the entire\nnation 24 hours a day, seven days a week.   News Talk. We currently program 32 of our radio stations in a News Talk format.\nOur research shows that our News Talk format is highly complementary to our core Christian Teaching and Talk format. As programmed by Salem, both formats express conservative views and family values. Our News Talk\n\n  8 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nformat allows us to leverage syndicated talk programming produced by Salem Radio NetworkTM (“SRNTM”) to radio stations throughout the United States. Syndication of our programs allows us to reach audiences in markets in which we do not own or operate radio stations. \nContemporary Christian Music. We currently program 12 of our radio stations in a Contemporary Christian Music (“CCM”) format,\nbranded The FISH® in most markets. Through the CCM format, we bring listeners the words of inspirational recording artists, set to upbeat contemporary music. Our music format, branded\n“Safe for the Whole Family”, features sounds and lyrics that listeners of all ages can enjoy and appreciate. The CCM genre continues to be popular. We believe that the listener base for CCM is underserved in terms of radio coverage,\nparticularly in larger markets, and that our stations fill an otherwise void area in listener choices.

The principal source of network broadcast revenue is from the sale of spot advertising time. Salem Consumer Products, our\ne-commerce site, generates broadcast revenue from the sale of host content materials.  We recognize\nadvertising revenue from radio stations as the spots air or are delivered. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived 22.1% of our net broadcast revenue, or $39.4 million, from the sale of local spot advertising and 8.6% of our net\nbroadcast revenue, or $15.3 million, from the sale of national spot advertising.  We recognize programming revenue as the programs\nair. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived 26.4% and 13.6% of our net broadcast revenue, or $47.0 million and $24.3 million, respectively, from the sale of national and local block programming time, respectively. National\nprogram revenue is primarily generated from geographically diverse, well-established non-profit religious and educational organizations that purchase time on our stations in a large number of markets in the\nUnited States. National program producers typically purchase 121/2, 25 or 50-minute blocks of time\non a Monday through Friday basis and may offer supplemental \n  11 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nprogramming for weekend release. We generate local program revenue from community organizations and churches that typically purchase blocks for weekend releases and from local speakers who\ngenerally purchase daily releases. Our strategy is to identify and assist quality local programs to expand into national syndication. \nSalem Radio NetworkTM \nSalem Radio NetworkTM\n(“SRNTM”), based in Dallas, Texas, develops, produces and syndicates a broad range of programming specifically targeted to Christian and family-themed talk stations, music stations and\nNews Talk stations.

We operate three businesses in our publishing segment.  Regnery® Publishing is a\ntraditional book publisher that has published dozens of bestselling books by leading conservative, Christian and history authors and personalities. Books are sold in traditional printed form and as eBooks with the following categories: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Regnery History—Regnery History brings new light to old subjects and introduces stories that deserve\nattention but may have been ignored or even covered up in the past.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Regnery Kids—Regnery Kidsbooks are non-partisan, entertaining, and\nbrilliantly written and illustrated by award-winning authors and artists.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Regnery Fiction—Regnery Fiction publishes exciting, thrilling stories with characters who embody American\nvalues and plots that explore controversial issues on the forefront of the American consciousness.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Gateway Editions—Regnery Gateway, dedicated to serious works of cultural, social, and political analysis, is\na reaffirmation of Regnery’s tradition of publishing original and penetrating conservative thinkers.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Salem Books—Our goal is to help people grow in their faith, and find comfort, encouragement, practical\nadvice, and timeless wisdom in compelling books by trusted authors.  Salem Author Services is a self-publishing service for authors\nthrough Xulon Press and Mill City Press. Xulon Press offers print-on-demand self-publishing services for Christian authors while Mill City Press serves most general\nmarket publications.  Singing News®\nproduces and distributes a print magazine for readers interested in southern gospel music.  Competition \nWe operate in a highly competitive broadcast and media business. We compete for audiences, advertisers and programmers with other radio broadcasters, broadcast\nand cable television operators, newspapers and magazines, book publishers, national and local digital services, outdoor advertising, direct mail, online marketing and media companies, social media platforms,\nweb-based blogs, and mobile devices.  BROADCASTING. Our broadcast audience ratings and\nmarket shares are subject to change, and any change in a particular market could adversely affect the revenue of our stations located in that market. While we already compete in some of our markets with stations that offer similar formats, if\nanother radio station were to convert its programming to a format similar to one of ours, or if an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations, our stations could suffer reduced ratings and/or reduced revenue. In these circumstances, we\ncould also incur significantly higher promotional and other related expenses. We cannot assure that our stations will maintain or increase their current audience ratings and revenue. \nWe compete for advertising revenue with other commercial religious format stations as well as general format radio stations. Our competition\nfor advertising dollars includes other radio stations as well as digital websites and social media, broadcast television, cable television, newspapers, magazines, direct mail and billboard advertising, some of which may be controlled by horizontally\nintegrated companies. Several factors can materially affect competitive advantage, including, but not limited to, audience ratings, program content, management talent and expertise, sales talent and experience, audience characteristics, signal\nstrength, and the number and characteristics of other radio stations in the same market. \n  16 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChristian and Family-Themed Radio. The segment of this industry that focuses on\nChristian and family themes is also a highly competitive business. The financial success of each of our radio stations that focuses on Christian Teaching and Talk is dependent, to a significant degree, upon its ability to generate revenue from the\nsale of block program time to national and local religious and educational organizations. We compete for this program revenue with a number of different commercial and non-commercial radio station licensees.\nWhile we believe that no commercial group owner in the United States specializing in Christian and family-themed programming approaches Salem in size of potential listening audience and presence in major markets, other religious radio stations exist\nand enjoy varying degrees of prominence and success in each of our markets.  New Methods of Content Delivery. Competition also comes\nfrom new media technologies and services. These include delivery of audio programming by cable television and satellite systems, digital audio radio services, mobile devices including smart phone applications for iPhone® and Android®, personal communications services, social media, and the service of low powered, limited coverage FM radio stations\nauthorized by the FCC. The delivery of live and stored audio programming through the Internet has also created new competition. In addition, satellite delivered digital audio radio, which delivers multiple audio programming formats to national\naudiences, has created competition. We have attempted to address these existing and potential competitive threats through a more active strategy to acquire and integrate new electronic communications formats including digital acquisitions, the\nlaunch of Salem Surround, and our exclusive arrangement to provide Christian and family-themed talk on SiriusXM, a satellite digital audio radio service. \nNETWORK. SRNTM competes with other commercial radio networks that offer news and\ntalk programming to religious and general format stations and noncommercial networks that offer Christian music formats. SRNTM also competes with other radio networks for the services of talk show\npersonalities.  DIGITAL MEDIA. SWN and Townhall Media compete for visitors and advertisers with other companies that deliver\nonline audio programming, that deliver Christian and conservative digital content, and providers of general market websites and social media. The online media and distribution business changes quickly and is highly competitive. We compete to attract\nand maintain interactions with advertisers, consumers, content creators and web publishers. Salem Church Products competes for customers with other online sites that offer resources useful in ministries, preaching, teaching and for employment within\nthe Christian community.  PUBLISHING. Regnery® Publishing competes with\nother book publishers for readers and book sales as well as competes for product quality, customer service, suitability of format and subject matter, author reputation, price, timely availability of both new titles and revisions of existing books,\ndigital availability of published products, and timely delivery of products to customers. Our print magazine competes for readers and advertisers with other print publications, including those geared toward Christian audiences. Salem Author Services\ncompetes for authors with other on-demand publishers including those focused exclusively on Christian book publishers. \nFederal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting \nIntroduction. The ownership, operation and sale of broadcast stations, including those licensed to Salem, are subject to the jurisdiction of the\nFCC, which acts under authority derived from The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Communications Act”). Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands for broadcasting;\ndetermines whether to approve certain changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates transmission facilities, including power employed, antenna and tower heights, and location of transmission facilities; adopts and implements\nregulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of stations; and has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules under the Communications Act. \n  17 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of specific FCC\nregulations and policies. Failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures, the grant of “short” (less than the maximum) license renewal terms or, for\nparticularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of a license or the denial of FCC consent to acquire additional broadcast properties. For further information concerning the nature and extent of federal\nregulation of broadcast stations you should refer to the Communications Act, FCC rules and the public notices and rulings of the FCC.  License Grant\nand Renewal. Radio broadcast licenses are granted for maximum terms of eight years. Licenses must be renewed through an application to the FCC. Under the Communications Act, the FCC will renew a broadcast license if it finds that the station\nhas served the public interest, convenience and necessity, that there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC, and that there have been no other violations by the licensee of\nthe Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC that, when taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse.  From time to time, the\nrenewal of certain licenses may be delayed. We continue to operate these radio stations under their existing licenses until the licenses are renewed. The affected stations are authorized to continue operations until the FCC acts upon the renewal\napplications. We continually monitor our stations’ compliance with the various regulatory requirements that are necessary for the FCC renewal. We are currently in the midst of the FCC’s radio renewal cycle, and license renewal applications\nfor certain of our stations will be pending during the course of the renewal cycle. We expect all of our broadcast licenses to be renewed by its conclusion. \nPetitions to deny license renewals can be filed by certain interested parties, including members of the public in a station’s market. Such petitions may\nraise various issues before the FCC. The FCC is required to hold hearings on renewal applications if the FCC is unable to determine that renewal of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity, or if a petition to deny raises\na “substantial and material question of fact” as to whether the grant of the renewal application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity. In addition, during certain periods when a\nrenewal application is pending, the transferability of the applicant’s license is restricted.  The following table sets forth information with\nrespect to each of our radio stations for which we hold the license. Stations that we operate under an LMA or TBA are not reflected on this table. A broadcast station’s market may be different from its community of license. The coverage of an\nAM radio station is chiefly a function of the power of the radio station’s transmitter, less dissipative power losses and any directional antenna adjustments. For FM radio stations, signal coverage area is chiefly a function of the Effective\nRadiated Power (“ERP”) of the radio station’s antenna and the Height Above Average Terrain (“HAAT”) of the radio station’s antenna.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Market (1)\n \nStation CallLetters\n \nFrequency\n \nOperatingFrequency\n \nExpirationDate ofLicense\n \nFCCClass\n \nHeight

The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast license\nwithout the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to assign, transfer, grant or renew a broadcast license, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee, including compliance with various rules limiting common\nownership of media properties, the “character” of the licensee and those persons holding “attributable” interests therein, and compliance with the Communications Act’s limitation on alien ownership, as well as compliance\nwith other FCC policies, including equal employment opportunity requirements. \n  21 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFCC rules and policies define the interests of individuals and entities, known as “attributable”\ninterests, which implicate FCC rules governing ownership of broadcast stations. and other specified mass media entities. Under these rules, attributable interests generally include: (1) officers and directors of a licensee and of its direct and\nindirect parents; (2) general partners; (3) limited partners and limited liability company members, unless properly “insulated” from management activities; (4) a 5% or more direct or indirect voting stock interest in a\ncorporate licensee or parent, except that, for a narrowly defined class of passive investors, the attribution threshold is a 20% or more voting stock interest; and (5) combined equity and debt interests in excess of 33% of a licensee’s\ntotal asset value, if the interest holder provides over 15% of the licensee station’s total weekly programming, or has an attributable same-service (radio or television) broadcast or newspaper interest in the same market (the “EDP\nRule”). An entity that owns one or more radio stations in a market and programs more than 15% of the broadcast time or sells more than 15% per week of the advertising time on a radio station in the same market is generally deemed to have an\nattributable interest in that station. Debt instruments, non-voting corporate stock, minority voting stock interests in corporations having a single majority stockholder, and properly insulated limited\npartnership and limited liability company interests generally are not subject to attribution unless such interests implicate the EDP Rule.  The FCC\nownership rules relevant to our business are summarized below. Because of these rules, a purchaser of voting stock of the company that acquires an “attributable” interest in the company may violate the FCC’s rule if it also has an\nattributable interest in another radio station, depending on the number and location of those radio stations. Such a purchaser also may be restricted in the other companies in which it may invest, to the extent that these investments give rise to an\nattributable interest. If an attributable stockholder of the company violates any of these ownership rules, the company may be unable to obtain from the FCC one or more authorizations needed to conduct its radio station business and may be unable to\nobtain FCC consents for certain future acquisitions.  Foreign Ownership: Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or\nheld by a corporation that has more than one-fifth of its capital stock owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by\nnon-U.S. corporations. Under the Communications Act, there are limitations on the licensee of a broadcast license, that is held by any corporation that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by any other\ncorporation more than one-fourth of whose capital stock is owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by\nnon-U.S. corporations. These restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships. We therefore may be restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted by aliens, foreign governments or non-U.S. corporations, although the FCC will entertain and authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing, proposals to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcasting holding companies. The FCC\ngenerally will not make such a determination absent favorable executive branch review.  Local Radio Ownership: The maximum allowable number of\nradio stations that may be commonly owned in a market is based on the size of the market. In markets with 45 or more stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to eight stations, of which no more than five are in the same radio\nservice (AM or FM). In markets with 30-44 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to seven stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 15-29 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to six stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 14 or fewer stations, one entity may have an attributable\ninterest in up to five stations, of which no more than three are in the same service, so long as the entity does not have an interest in more than 50% of all stations in the market. To apply these ownership tiers, the FCC relies on Nielsen Metro\nSurvey Areas, where they exist, and a signal contour-overlap methodology where they do not exist. An FCC rulemaking is pending to determine how to define radio markets for stations located outside Nielsen Metro Survey Areas. \nThe FCC also restricts the number of television stations an entity may own both in local markets and nationwide. \n  22 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur current ownership of radio broadcast stations complies with the FCC’s multiple ownership rules;\nhowever, these rules may limit the number of additional stations that we may acquire in the future in certain of our markets.  Cross-Ownership: The\nnewspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule prohibits an individual or entity from having an attributable interest in either a radio or television station and a daily newspaper located in the same market, subject to certain exceptions and with waivers\navailable in particular cases. The radio/television cross-ownership rule limits common ownership of television stations and same market radio stations. In general, an individual or entity may hold attributable interests in one television station and\nup to seven same-market radio stations (or two television stations and up to six same-market radio stations), depending on the number of independently owned radio, television and other specified media “voices” in the market. \nReview of Media Ownership Rules: The FCC is required by statute to review all of its broadcast ownership rules on a quadrennial basis (i.e.,\nevery four years) and to repeal or modify any of its rules that are no longer “necessary in the public interest.” Despite several such reviews and appellate remands, the FCC’s rules limiting the number of radio stations that may be\ncommonly owned in a local market have remained largely intact since their initial adoption following the 1996 Act. The FCC’s previous ownership reviews have been subject to litigation. \nIn November 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a decision that resulted in reinstatement of the cross-ownership rules,\nwhich the FCC had previously eliminated. The Supreme Court of the United States granted petitions for certiorari seeking review of the Third Circuit decision and heard argument on January 19, 2021. The case remains pending. The FCC initiated\nits 2018 quadrennial review in December 2018 and that proceeding remains pending. Among other things, the FCC is seeking comment on all aspects of the local radio ownership rule’s implementation and whether the current version of the rule\nremains necessary in the public interest. We cannot predict whether the appeal or forthcoming review proceeding will result in modifications of the ownership rules or the impact (if any) that such modifications would have on our business. \nFederal Antitrust Considerations. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), which evaluate\ntransactions to determine whether those transactions should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws, are also active in their review of radio station acquisitions, particularly where an operator proposes to acquire additional stations in its\nexisting markets.  For an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Improvements Act (“HSR Act”) and the rules\npromulgated thereunder require the parties to file Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition. At any time before or after the consummation of a\nproposed acquisition, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws, as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or other\nassets of the company. The FTC or the DOJ may investigate acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the HSR Act under the antitrust laws before or after consummation. In addition, private parties may under certain circumstances bring\nlegal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws. The DOJ also has stated publicly that it believes that LMAs and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers prior to the expiration\nof the waiting period under the HSR Act could violate the HSR Act.  We can provide no assurances that our acquisition strategy will not be adversely\naffected in any material respect by antitrust reviews.  Geographic Financial Information \nOur customers are based in various locations throughout the United States. While no one customer currently accounts for 10% or more of our total revenue\nindividually or in the aggregate, our broadcast operating segment is particularly dependent on revenue generated from our Los Angeles and Dallas broadcast markets. Our Los \n  23 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nAngeles radio stations generated 10.6% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 11.6% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019. Our Dallas radio stations generated 9.3% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 10.1% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. \nBecause substantial portions of our broadcast revenue is derived from our Los Angeles and Dallas markets, our ability to generate revenue in those markets\ncould be adversely affected by local or regional economic downturns in these areas.  Available Information \nOur Internet address is www.salemmedia.com. We make available free of charge on our investor relations website under the heading “SEC Filings” our\nAnnual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports\nfiled or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. These reports are available as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file them or furnish them to the SEC. Any information found on our website is not\na part of or incorporated by reference into, this or any other report of the company filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. \nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.  Not\nrequired for smaller reporting companies.  ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. \nNone.  ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\n We own or lease various properties throughout the United States from which we conduct business. No one physical property is material to our overall\nbusiness operations. We believe that each of our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to upgrade our properties. We believe that we will be able to renew existing leases\nwhen applicable or obtain comparable facilities, as necessary.  Executive Offices \nOur executive offices are located in Irving, Texas, where we own an approximately 43,000 square foot office building. \nBroadcasting  Our broadcast facilities include\noffices and studios, transmitter locations, antenna sites and tower sites. Offices and studios are typically located in buildings that are in a downtown or business district. Transmitter, antenna and tower sites are located in areas that provide\nmaximum market coverage. Our radio stations broadcast from 89 tower sites, including 44 tower sites in which we own the land.  SRNTM, SMR , Salem Consumer Products, our Dallas radio stations studios and offices, and our executive offices are located in the Dallas, Texas metropolitan area. We also own office buildings in Honolulu,\nHawaii; Tampa, Florida; Orlando, Florida and Greenville, South Carolina from which our radio stations studios and offices operate. Our national radio network operates from various offices and studios. These studios may be used to generate\nprogramming or programming can also be relayed from a remote point of origination. Our network also leases satellite transponders used in the delivery of its programming. \nOur current lease agreements range from four months to twenty-eight years remaining on the lease term. We lease certain property from our principal\nstockholders or trusts and partnerships created for the benefit of the principal stockholders and their families. These leases are described in Note 17, Related Party Transactions in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in\nItem 8 of this annual report. \n  24 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhile none of our owned or leased properties is individually material to our operations, if we were required\nto relocate any of our broadcast towers, the cost would be significant. Significant costs are due to the moving and reconstruction of the tower as well as the limited number of sites in any geographic area that permit a tower of reasonable height to\nprovide adequate market coverage. These limitations are due to zoning and other land use restrictions, as well as Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations. \nDigital Media  Our digital media entities operate\nfrom office buildings and require additional data storage centers. SWN operates from leased office facilities in Richmond, Virginia and Nashville, Tennessee. Townhall Media operates from a leased facility in Arlington, Virginia that is shared with\nour radio stations and Eagle Financial Publications. Our current lease agreements range from one to six years remaining on the lease term. \nPublishing  Regnery® Publishing operates from a leased facility in Washington, D.C. with inventory fulfillment managed by a third-party in Delran, New Jersey. Salem Author Services operates from a leased facility in\nOrlando, Florida. Singing News® operates from a leased facility in Nashville, Tennessee that is shared with our broadcasting operations in that market. Our current lease agreements\nrange from two to three years remaining on the lease term.  Corporate \nCertain corporate administrative functions are performed in Camarillo, California where we own an approximately 46,000 square foot office building. \nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. \nWe and our subsidiaries, incident to our business activities, are parties to a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits, arbitration and other claims. Such\nmatters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance. We maintain insurance that may provide coverage for such matters. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary\nliability or the financial impact with respect to these matters. We believe, at this time, that the final resolution of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not adversely affect upon our annual consolidated financial position,\nresults of operations or cash flows.

(“Salem”\n“we” “us” “our” and “its”) is a domestic multimedia company specializing in Christian and conservative content, with media properties comprising radio broadcasting, digital media, and publishing. Our content\nis intended for audiences interested in Christian and family-themed programming and \n  27 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nconservative news talk. We maintain a website at www.salemmedia.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports\nare electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information on our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference into this or any other report of the company filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. \nWe have three operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating\nsegments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of senior executives, assess the performance of each operating segment and determine the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We\ncontinually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our business and may make changes as necessary.  We measure\nand evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that exclude costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury. We also exclude costs such as\namortization, depreciation, taxes and interest expense when evaluating the performance of our operating segments.  Our principal sources of broadcast\nrevenue include:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of block program time to national and local program producers; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of advertising time on our radio stations to national and local advertisers; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of banner advertisements on our station websites or on our mobile applications; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of digital streaming advertisements on our station websites or on our mobile applications;\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of advertisements included in digital newsletters; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n fees earned for the creation of custom web pages and custom digital media campaigns for our advertisers through\nSalem Surround;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of advertising time on our national network; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the syndication of programming on our national network; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n product sales and royalties for on-air host materials, including podcasts\nand programs; and   \n\n\n \n•\n \n other revenue such as events, including ticket sales and sponsorships, listener purchase programs, where revenue\nis generated from special discounts and incentives offered to our listeners from our advertisers; talent fees for voice-overs or custom endorsements from our on-air personalities and production services, and\nlease income for studios, towers or office space.  Our principal sources of digital media revenue include: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of digital banner advertisements on our websites and mobile applications; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of digital streaming advertisements on websites and mobile applications; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the support and promotion to stream third-party content on our websites; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of advertisements included in digital newsletters; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the digital delivery of newsletters to subscribers; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the number of video and graphic downloads. \nOur principal sources of publishing revenue include:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of books and e-books; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n publishing fees from authors; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of digital advertising on our magazine websites and digital newsletters; \n  28 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n•\n \n subscription fees for our print magazine; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the sale of print magazine advertising. \nIn each of our operating segments, the rates we can charge for airtime, advertising and other products and services are dependent upon several factors,\nincluding:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n audience share;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n how well our programs and advertisements perform for our clients; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the size of the market and audience reached; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the number of impressions delivered; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the number of advertisements and programs streamed; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the number of page views achieved; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the number of downloads completed; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the number of events held, the number of event sponsorships sold and the attendance at each event;\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n demand for books and publications; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n general economic conditions; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n supply and demand for airtime on a local and national level. \nBroadcasting  Our foundational business is radio\nbroadcasting, which includes the ownership and operation of radio stations in large metropolitan markets, our national networks and our national sales firms including Salem Surround. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description\nof our broadcasting operations.  Revenue generated from our radio stations, networks and sales firms is reported as broadcast revenue in our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. Advertising revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the advertiser, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. \nBroadcast revenue is impacted by the rates radio stations can charge for programming and advertising time, the level of airtime sold to programmers and\nadvertisers, the number of impressions delivered or downloads made, and the number of events held, including the size of the event and the number of attendees. Block programming rates are based upon our stations’ ability to attract audiences\nthat will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products. Advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time, which in turn is based on our stations and networks’ ability to produce results for\ntheir advertisers. We market ourselves to advertisers based on the responsiveness of our audiences. We do not subscribe to traditional audience measuring services for most of our radio stations. In select markets, we subscribe to Nielsen Audio,\nwhich develops monthly reports measuring a radio station’s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers. Each of our radio stations and our networks has a pre-determined level of time\navailable for block programming and/or advertising, which may vary at different times of the day.  Nielsen Audio uses the Portable People Meter TM (“PPM”) technology to collect data for its ratings service. PPM is a small device that is capable of automatically measuring radio,\ntelevision, Internet, satellite radio and satellite television signals encoded by the broadcaster. The PPM offers a number of advantages over traditional diary ratings collection systems, including ease of use, more reliable ratings data, shorter\ntime periods between when \n  29 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nadvertising runs and actual listening data, and little manipulation of data by users. A disadvantage of the\nPPM includes data fluctuations from changes to the “panel” (a group of individuals holding PPM devices). This makes all stations susceptible to some inconsistencies in ratings that may or may not accurately reflect the actual number of\nlisteners at any given time. We subscribe to Nielsen Audio for ratings services in 7 of our broadcast markets.  Our results are subject to seasonal\nfluctuations. As is typical in the broadcasting industry, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue typically exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. Seasonal fluctuations in advertising revenue correspond with quarterly\nfluctuations in the retail industry. Additionally, we experience increased demand for political advertising during election, or even numbered years, over non-election or odd numbered years. Political\nadvertising revenue varies based on the number and type of candidates as well as the number and type of debated issues.  Our cash flows from broadcasting\nare affected by transitional periods experienced by radio stations when, based on the nature of the radio station, our plans for the market and other circumstances, we find it beneficial to change the station format. During this transitional period,\nwhen we develop a radio station’s listener and customer base, the station may generate negative or insignificant cash flow.  In broadcasting, trade\nor barter agreements are commonly used to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services. We may enter barter agreements to exchange airtime or digital advertising for goods or services that can be used in our business or\nthat can be sold to our audience under Listener Purchase Programs. The terms of these barter agreements permit us to preempt the barter airtime or digital campaign in favor of customers who purchase the airtime or digital campaign for cash. The\nvalue of these non-cash exchanges is included in revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the goods or services we receive. Each transaction must be reviewed to determine that the products, supplies\nand/or services we receive have economic substance, or value to us. We record barter operating expenses upon receipt and usage of the products, supplies and services, as applicable. We record barter revenue as advertising spots or digital campaigns\nare delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Barter revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which case,\nrevenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 98% and 97%, respectively, of our broadcast revenue was sold for cash. \nBroadcast operating expenses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as\nlease expense and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) production and programming expenses, and (v) music license fees. In addition to these expenses, our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for\nsatellite communication facilities.  Digital Media \nOur digital media based businesses provide Christian, conservative, investing, e-commerce, audio and video streaming,\nand other resources digitally through the web. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of each of our digital media websites and operations. \nRevenue generated from this segment is reported as digital media revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this annual report. Digital\nmedia revenue is impacted by the rates our sites can charge for advertising time, the level of advertisements sold, the number of impressions delivered or the number of products sold and the number of digital subscriptions sold. Like our\nbroadcasting segment, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. This seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail\nadvertising industry. We also experience fluctuations in quarter-over-quarter comparisons based on the date on which Easter is observed, as this holiday generates a higher volume of product downloads from our church product websites. Additionally,\nwe experience increased demand for advertising time and placement during election years for political advertisements. \n  30 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe primary operating expenses incurred by our digital media businesses include: (i) employee salaries,\ncommissions and related employee benefits and taxes, (ii) facility expenses such as lease expense and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses, (iv) royalties, (v) streaming costs, and (vi) cost of goods sold\nassociated with e-commerce sites.  Publishing \nOur publishing operations include book publishing through Regnery® Publishing, self-publishing\nservices through Salem Author Services and Singing News Magazine. Refer to Item 1. Business of this annual report for a description of each of our publishing operations. \nRevenue generated from this segment is reported as publishing revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this annual report. Publishing\nrevenue is impacted by the retail price of books and e-books, the number of books sold, the number and retail price of e-books sold, the number and rate of print\nmagazine subscriptions sold, the rate and number of pages of advertisements sold in each print magazine, and the number and rate at which self-published books are published. Regnery®\nPublishing revenue is impacted by elections as it generates higher levels of interest and demand for publications containing conservative and political based opinions. \nThe primary operating expenses incurred by our publishing businesses include: (i) employee salaries, commissions and related employee benefits and taxes,\n(ii) facility expenses such as lease expense and utilities, (iii) marketing and promotional expenses; and (iv) cost of goods sold that includes printing and production costs, fulfillment costs, author royalties and inventory reserves.\n Known Trends and Uncertainties  In March 2020, the\nWorld Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. The responses by federal, state and local governments to restrict public gatherings and travel rapidly grew to include stay-at-home orders, school closures and mandatory restrictions on non-essential businesses and services that has adversely affected\nworkforces, certain economies, and financial markets resulting in a significant economic downturn. We experienced declining revenue from advertising, programming, events and book sales. Several advertisers reduced or ceased advertising spend due to\nthe outbreak and stay-at-home orders that effectively shut many businesses down. This was particularly true within our broadcast segment, which derives substantial\nrevenue from local advertisers who have been particularly hard hit due to social distancing and government interventions and in our publishing segment that sells books in retail stores and through live events. \nWhile this disruption is expected to be temporary, there remains to be considerable uncertainty around the duration. Although advertising revenue continues to\nimprove from the lowest levels experienced during April and May of 2020, it remains significantly below prior years. The exact timing and pace of the recovery has not been determinable as certain markets have reopened, some of which have since\nexperienced a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, resulting in varying degrees of reinstated stay-at-home orders. Due to continuing\nuncertainties regarding the ultimate scope and trajectory of COVID-19’s spread and evolution, it is impossible to predict the total impact that the pandemic will have on our business. If public and\nprivate entities continue to enforce restrictive measures, the material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could persist. Our businesses could also continue to be impacted by the disruptions\nfrom COVID-19 and resulting adverse changes in advertising customers and consumer behavior.  Future availability\nunder our credit facility is contingent upon our eligible receivable balance, which is negatively impacted by lower revenue and longer days to collect. Availability under our ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of (a) 90% of the\neligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount based on the value of certain real property. The maximum amount available under our ABL Facility declined to $24.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $26.4 million at\nDecember 31, 2019, of which $5.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2020 compared to $12.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019. \n  31 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe growth of broadcast revenue associated with the sale of airtime remains challenged. We believe this is\ndue to increased competition from other forms of content distribution and the length of time spent listening to audio streaming services, podcasts and satellite radio. Increases in competition and the mix in listening time may lead advertisers to\nconclude that the effectiveness of radio has diminished. To minimize the impact of these factors, we continue to enhance our digital assets to complement our broadcast content. The increase use of voice activated platforms, or smart speakers, that\nprovide audiences with the ability to access AM and FM radio stations show increased potential for broadcasters to reach audiences.  Our broadcast revenue\nis particularly dependent on advertising from our Los Angeles and Dallas markets, which generated 10.6% and 9.3% respectively, of our total net broadcast revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 11.6% and 10.1%, respectively,\nof our total net broadcast revenue during the same period of the prior year.  Revenue from print magazines, including advertising revenue and subscription\nrevenue, is challenged due to lower demand from the audiences that increasingly use other mediums that deliver comparable information. Book sales are contingent upon overall economic conditions and our ability to attract and retain authors.\nDecreases in digital revenue could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and results of operations. Digital revenue is impacted by the nature and delivery of page views and the number of advertisements per page. We have\nexperienced a shift in the number of page views from desktop devices to mobile devices. While mobile page views have increased dramatically, they carry a lower number of advertisements per page and are generally sold at lower rates. A shift from\ndesktop page views to mobile device views negatively impacts revenue as mobile devices carry lower rates and less advertisement per page. To minimize the impact that any one of these areas could have, we continue to explore opportunities to\ncross-promote our brands and our content, and to strategically monitor costs.  Key Financial Performance Indicators—Same-Station Definition\n In the discussion of our results of operations below, we compare our broadcast operating results between periods on an\nas-reported basis, which includes the operating results of all radio stations and networks owned or operated at any time during either period and on a Same Station basis. Same Station is a Non-GAAP financial measure used both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community as well as in our internal evaluations and management of the business. We believe that Same Station\nOperating Income provides a meaningful comparison of period over period performance of our core broadcast operations as this measure excludes the impact of new stations, the impact of stations we no longer own or operate, and the impact of stations\noperating under a new programming format. Our presentation of Same Station Operating Income is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Refer\nto “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” below for definitions and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP performance measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \nManagement uses certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below in communications with investors, analysts, rating\nagencies, banks and others to assist such parties in understanding the impact of various items on our financial statements. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate financial results, develop\nbudgets, manage expenditures and as a measure of performance under compensation programs.  Our presentation of these\nnon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable financial measures as reported in accordance with GAAP. \nItem 10(e) of Regulation S-K defines and prescribes the conditions under which certain\nnon-GAAP financial information may be presented in this annual report. We closely monitor EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Station Operating Income (“SOI”), Same Station net broadcast revenue, Same Station\nbroadcast operating expenses, \n  32 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nSame Station Operating Income, Digital Media Operating Income, and Publishing Operating Income, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe\nthat these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our core operating results, and thus, are appropriate to enhance the overall understanding of our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide management and investors a more complete understanding of our underlying operational results, trends and performance. \nThe performance of a radio broadcasting company is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate SOI. We define SOI as net broadcast revenue\nless broadcast operating expenses. Accordingly, changes in net broadcast revenue and broadcast operating expenses, as explained above, have a direct impact on changes in SOI. SOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nSOI should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of GAAP. We believe that SOI is a useful non-GAAP financial measure to investors when\nconsidered in conjunction with operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to SOI), because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation\nmethodologies for companies in the media, entertainment and communications industries. SOI is commonly used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide comparisons between broadcasting groups. We use SOI as one of the key\nmeasures of operating efficiency and profitability, including our internal reviews for potential impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets and our internal reviews to approve capital expenditures. SOI does not purport to represent cash\nprovided by operating activities. Our statement of cash flows presents our cash activity in accordance with GAAP and our income statement presents our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of SOI is not necessarily\ncomparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  We define Same Station net broadcast revenue as net broadcast revenue from our radio\nstations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. We define Same Station broadcast operating expenses as broadcast operating expenses\nfrom our radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income includes those stations we own or operate\nin the same format on the first and last day of each quarter, as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Same Station Operating Income for a full calendar year is calculated as the sum of the Same Station-results for each of the four\nquarters of that year. We use Same Station Operating Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluations and\nmanagement of the business. We believe that Same Station Operating Income provides a meaningful comparison of period over period performance of our core broadcast operations as this measure excludes the impact of new stations, the impact of stations\nwe no longer own or operate, and the impact of stations operating under a new programming format. Our presentation of Same Station Operating Income is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable\nfinancial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of Same Station net broadcast revenue, Same Station broadcast operating expenses and Same Station Operating Income is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures\nreported by other companies.  We apply a similar methodology to our digital media and publishing group. Digital Media Operating Income is defined as net\ndigital media revenue less digital media operating expenses. Publishing Operating Loss is defined as net publishing revenue less publishing operating expenses. Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are not measures of\nperformance in accordance with GAAP. Our presentations of these non-GAAP financial performance measures are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to our operating results reported in accordance\nwith GAAP. We believe that Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income are useful non-GAAP financial measures to investors, when considered in conjunction with operating income (the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measure), because they are comparable to those used to measure performance of our broadcasting entities. We use this analysis as one of the key measures of operating efficiency, profitability and in our internal\nreviews for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets and our internal reviews to approve capital expenditures. This measurement does not purport to represent cash \n  33 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nprovided by operating activities. Our statement of cash flows presents our cash activity in accordance with GAAP and our income statement presents our financial performance in accordance with\nGAAP. Our definitions of Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Loss are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. \nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before gains or losses on the\ndisposition of assets, before changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, before gains on bargain purchases, before the change in fair value of interest rate swaps, before\nimpairments, before net miscellaneous income and expenses, before loss on early retirement of debt, before (gain) loss from discontinued operations and before non-cash compensation expense. EBITDA and Adjusted\nEBITDA are commonly used by the broadcast and media industry as important measures of performance and are used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide meaningful comparisons between broadcasters. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nare not measures of liquidity or of performance in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for or superior to our results of operations and financial condition presented in accordance with GAAP. Our\ndefinitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  For all non-GAAP financial measures, investors should consider the limitations associated with these metrics, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. \nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: \nIn the tables below, we present a reconciliation of net broadcast revenue, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Same Station net broadcast revenue, and\nbroadcast operating expenses, the most comparable GAAP measure to Same Station broadcast operating expense. We show our calculation of SOI and Same Station Operating Income, which is reconciled from net income, the most comparable GAAP measure in\nthe table following our calculation of Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Loss. Our presentation of these non-GAAP measures are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to the\nmost directly comparable measures reported in accordance with GAAP.  In the table below, we present our calculations of Station Operating Income, Digital\nMedia Operating Income and Publishing Operating Income. Our presentation of these non-GAAP performance indicators are not to be considered a substitute for or superior to the directly comparable measures\nreported in accordance with GAAP.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n2019\n \n  \n2020\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Net broadcast revenue\n  \n$\n 193,339\n \n  \n$\n 178,127\n \n\n Less broadcast operating expenses\n  \n \n(149,439\n) \n  \n \n(140,942\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Station Operating Income\n  \n$\n 43,900\n \n  \n$\n 37,185\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Net digital media revenue\n  \n$\n 39,165\n \n  \n$\n 39,593\n \n\n Less digital media operating expenses\n  \n \n(30,801\n) \n  \n \n(31,725\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Digital Media Operating Income\n  \n$\n 8,364\n \n  \n$\n 7,868\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Net publishing revenue\n  \n$\n 21,394\n \n  \n$\n 18,519\n \n\n Less publishing operating expenses\n  \n \n(22,348\n) \n  \n \n(21,950\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Publishing Operating Loss\n  \n$\n (954)\n \n  \n$\n (3,431)\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n In the table below, we present a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Station\nOperating Income, Digital Media Operating Income and Publishing Operating Loss.

The decline includes $2.7 million of revenue generated in 2019 from stations sold during that year, of which $2.3 million was local programming and $0.4 million was\nnational programming. Additionally, approximately $1.2 million of the decline was due to local sports programming that was cancelled during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and $0.4 million from\nearly payments discounts offered to a limited number of national programmers during 2020. The remainder of the decline was due to certain programmers discontinuing their ministry efforts and an increase in competition from other broadcasters and\nfrom podcasts that resulted in a lower number of programs and lower rates. \n  37 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAdvertising revenue, net of agency commissions, declined by $13.5 million, $15.9 million net of\npolitical, due to a $13.3 million decline in local advertising net of political and a $2.6 million decline in national advertising revenue net of political. Local advertising, net of political, declined by $5.6 million on our\nContemporary Christian Music format radio stations, $3.0 million on our Christian Teaching and Talk format radio stations, $2.4 million on our News Talk format radio stations, and $2.1 million on other format stations. These declines\nwere due to lower spot rates charged to compete with other broadcasters, primarily in the Dallas, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets, where competition for advertising buys was strong. An additional $1.4 million of the decline resulted from\nstations sold during 2019. The remainder of the decline was attributable to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with many advertisers reducing or ceasing to advertise due to stay-at-home orders and limited capacity orders that temporarily closed their businesses. \nStation digital revenue, or local digital revenue generated from our radio stations and networks, increased by $9.6 million due to the growth of digital\nproduct offerings through Salem Surround, our national multimedia digital advertising agency providing digital marketing services to our customers. Our product offerings include social media campaigns, search engine optimization, retargeted\nadvertising and other services intended to increase our market share as advertising dollars shift away from pure broadcast to include digital and digital technologies. In addition, we recently launched SalemNOW, an\non-demand pay-per-view video steaming platform that contributed $4.4 million of the $9.6 million growth in revenue.\nThere were no significant changes in digital rates as compared to the prior year.  Declines in infomercial revenue were due to a reduction in the number\nof infomercials aired with no significant changes in rates as compared to the prior year. The placement of infomercials can vary significantly from one period to another due to the number of time slots available and the degree to which the\ninfomercial content is considered to be of interest to our audience.  Network revenue, net of digital, increased by $0.3 million due to a\n$1.7 million decline in national advertising revenue offset by a $2.0 million increase in political advertising.  Other revenue declined by\n$3.5 million due to a $2.7 million decrease in event revenue from the cancellation of live events due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a $0.7 million decrease in listener purchase program revenue from\nlower listener participation. Event revenue varies from period to period based on the nature and timing of events, audience demand, and in some cases, the weather, which can affect attendance. We began offering virtual events during 2020 that may\ncontinue as conditions warrant.  On a Same Station basis, net broadcast revenue decreased $11.0 million, which reflects these items net of the impact\nof stations acquired, disposed of, or with format changes.

The net increase from Townhall Media includes\n$0.6 million from our March 2019 acquisition of pjmedia.com and increases from political elections and national events. Declines in national digital advertising from SWN are attributable to a loss of advertisers who moved advertising spending\nto digital programmatic advertisers, such as Facebook and Google, and to a loss of advertisers who reduced or eliminated advertising. We continue to acquire, develop and promote the use of mobile applications, particularly for our Christian mobile\napplications, to reduce our dependency on page views from digital programmatic advertisers. Because mobile page views carry fewer advertisements and tend to have shorter site visits as compared to desktop, our growth in mobile page views exceeds our\ngrowth in revenue from the mobile applications.  Digital streaming revenue decreased $0.4 million based on lower demand for content available from\nour Christian websites. There were no significant changes in sales volume or rates as compared to the prior year.  Digital subscription revenue increased\n$1.2 million, including a $1.0 million increase from Townhall VIP, a new subscription service from Townhall Media, $0.2 million from InvesmentHouse.com that was acquired in June 2019, and a $0.2 million net increase in the number\nof subscribers to newsletters from Eagle Financial Publications, offset by a $0.2 million decrease from Christianjobs.com and Churchstaffing.com within SWN. \nDigital download revenue increased by $0.2 million from our church product websites, WorshipHouseMedia.com and SermonSpiceTM.com. There were no significant changes in rates as compared to the prior year.  E-commerce revenue decreased by $0.3 million including a $0.4 million decrease from the sale of Newport Natural Health on March 21, 2019 that was offset with a $0.1 million increase from Eagle\nFinancial Publications. There were no significant changes in rates as compared to the prior year.  Other revenue includes revenue sharing arrangements for\nmobile applications and mail list rentals. We recognized revenue of $0.2 million in 2019 related to transfer services provided to the buyer of Newport Natural Health.

Regnery® Publishing book sales reflect an 2% decrease in the average price per unit sold and a 22%\ndecrease in volume due to a majority of book stores in the country being closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Amazon’s decision to prioritize the shipment of essential products over the shipment of\nbooks. Revenue from book sales through Regnery® Publishing are directly attributable to the number of titles released each period and the composite mix of titles available. Revenue varies\nsignificantly from period to period based on the book release date and the number of titles that achieve placement on bestseller lists, which can increase awareness and demand for the book. The decrease of $1.3 million to the estimated sales\nreturns and allowances reflects the lower number of print books sold through Regnery® Publishing. The decline in book sales from Salem Author Services was due to authors choosing not to buy\nbooks because they could not be promoted at live events. There were no significant changes in sale prices as compared to the prior year.  Regnery® Publishing e-book sales increased by $0.2 million with a 12% decrease in sales volume offset by a 27% increase in the average price per unit sold from\nsales incentives. E-book sales can also vary based on the composite mix of titles released and available in each period. Revenue varies significantly based on the book release date and the number of titles\nthat achieve placement on bestseller lists, which can increase awareness and demand for the book.  Self-publishing fees decreased $0.4 million due a\ndecline in the number of authors with rates charged that were comparable to the prior year.  Declines in print magazine subscription revenue and\nadvertising revenue reflect lower consumer demand and distribution levels. There were no significant changes in rates over the prior year.  Digital\nadverting revenue from Regnery® Publishing websites was consistent with the prior year with no changes in volume or rates. \nOther revenue includes change fees, video trailers, and subright revenue for foreign translation and audio books for original published titles from Regnery® Publishing. Subright revenue declined $0.2 million due to lower demand. \n  40 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBroadcast Operating Expenses \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n2019\n \n  \n2020\n \n  \nChange $\n \n \nChange %\n \n \n2019\n \n \n2020\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n \n \n \n \n% of Total Net Revenue\n \n\n Broadcast Operating Expenses\n  \n$\n149,439\n \n  \n$\n140,942\n \n  \n$\n(8,497\n) \n \n \n(5.7\n)% \n \n \n58.9\n% \n \n \n59.7\n% \n\n Same Station Broadcast Operating Expenses\n  \n$\n141,189\n \n  \n$\n137,774\n \n  \n$\n(3,415\n) \n \n \n(2.4\n)% \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Broadcast operating expenses decreased by $8.5 million including $11.0 million from cost reduction initiatives and\n$5.1 million from stations sold during 2019 that were offset by a $7.5 million increase in costs from Salem Surround and SalemNOW. We implemented several cost cutting measures in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in a $3.4 million reduction in employee-related costs from temporary pay cuts, layoffs and furloughs, a $2.2 million decline in event costs, a $2.0 million decline in\nadvertising, a $1.1 million decline in travel and entertainment, and a $0.3 million decline in lease expense. The decrease also reflects a $3.4 million decline in commissions consistent with lower revenue, a $0.4 million decline\nin non-cash stock-based compensation associated with restricted stock awards, and a $0.3 million decline in music license fees that was partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in bad debt expense,\nincluding an additional reserve of $1.1 million recorded at March 31, 2020 due to the impact on collections of the economic uncertainties from the COVID-19 pandemic, a $0.5 million increase in\nlegal fees and a $0.5 million increase in insurance and software maintenance fees.  On a same-station basis, broadcast operating expenses decreased\nby $3.4 million.

Actual results are compared to the estimates and probabilities of achievement used in our\nforecasts. Should actual results of the acquired business increase or decrease as compared to our estimates and assumptions, the estimated fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration liability will\nincrease or decrease, up to the contracted limit, as applicable. Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration may materially impact and cause volatility in our operating\nresults.  At December 31, 2020, no estimated contingent earn-out consideration was outstanding compared to\n$19,000 at December 31, 2019. We recorded a net decrease to our estimated contingent earn-out liabilities of $12,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net decrease of $41,000 during\nthe prior year. Changes in our estimates of the contingent earn-out reflect the volatility of projected revenue growth, page views and session time.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES \nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared\nin accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \nWe believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates are critical accounting policies that affect the preparation of our\nConsolidated Financial Statements:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n going concern evaluations; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n revenue recognition;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n asset impairments, including broadcasting licenses, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets;\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n probabilities associated with the potential for contingent earn-out\nconsideration;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n fair value measurements; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n contingency reserves;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n allowance for doubtful accounts; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n sales returns and allowances; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n barter transactions;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n inventory reserves;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n reserves for royalty advances; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n fair value of equity awards; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n self-insurance reserves; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n estimated lives for tangible and intangible assets; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n assessment of contract-based factors, asset-based factors, entity-based factors and market-based factors to\ndetermine the lease term impacting Right-Of-Use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n determining the Incremental Borrowing Rate (“IBR”) for calculating ROU assets and lease liabilities;\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n income tax valuation allowances; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n uncertain tax positions. \n  46 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThese estimates require the use of judgment as future events and the effect of these events cannot be\npredicted with certainty. The estimates will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired and as more information is obtained. We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and we may consult outside experts\nto assist as considered necessary.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to create significant uncertainty and\ndisruption in the global economy and financial markets. It is reasonably possible that these uncertainties could materially impact our estimates related to, but not limited to, revenue recognition, broadcast licenses, goodwill and income taxes. As a\nresult, many of our estimates and assumptions require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. Our estimates may change as new events occur and additional information emerges, and such changes are recognized or\ndisclosed in our consolidated financial statements.  We believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates are critical\naccounting policies that affect the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Going Concern \nManagement is responsible for evaluating conditions or events as related to uncertainties that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going\nconcern and to provide related footnote disclosures, as applicable. Management’s estimates and assumptions, used in the evaluation of our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date our financial statements\nare issued, are based on the facts and circumstances at such date and are subject to a material and high level of subjectivity and uncertainty due to the matters themselves being uncertain and subject to modification. The effect of any individual or\naggregate changes in the estimates and assumptions, or the facts and circumstances, could be material to the financial statements.  Given the decreases in\nrevenue caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed a variety of factors, including media industry forecasts, expected operating results, forecasted net cash flows from operations, future obligations and\nliquidity, and capital expenditure commitments. We concluded that the potential that we could incur a considerable decrease in operating income and the resulting impact on our ability to fund interest payments on our debt, were probable conditions\nwhich gave rise to a need for an assessment of whether substantial doubt existed of our ability to continue as a going concern.  We reforecast our\nanticipated results extending through March 2022. Our reforecast includes the impact of certain cost-cutting measures associated with reductions in staffing, reductions in commissions and royalty expenses based on lower revenue forecasts, reductions\nin travel and entertainment expenses due to stay-at-home mandates, reductions in event costs, company-wide pay cuts, furloughs of certain employees, and the temporary\nsuspension of the company 401(k) match. Based on our current assessment, we believe that we have the ability to meet our obligations as they come due for one year from the issuance of the financial statements. \nRevenue Recognition  Significant management\njudgments and estimates must be made in connection with determining the amount of revenue to be recognized in any accounting period. We must assess the promises within each sales contract to determine if they are distinct performance obligations.\nOnce the performance obligation(s) are determined, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligation(s) based on a relative standalone selling price basis. If a sales contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire\ntransaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price.\nIf the stand-alone selling price is not determinable, an estimate is used.  We make significant estimates related to variable consideration at the point\nof sale, including estimates for refunds and product returns. Under ASC Topic 606, estimates of variable consideration are to be recognized \n  47 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nbefore contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances, including when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of any estimated cumulative revenue will not occur. \nA growing source of revenue is generated from digital product offerings, which allow for enhanced audience interaction and participation, and integrated\ndigital advertising solutions. When offering digital products, another party may be involved in providing the goods or services that make up a performance obligation to the customer. These include the use of third-party websites for social media\ncampaigns. We must evaluate if we are the principal or agent in order to determine if revenue should be reported gross as principal or net as agent. In this evaluation, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they\nare transferred to our customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price. The determination of whether we control a specified good or service\nimmediately prior to the good or service being transferred requires us to make reasonable judgments on the nature of each agreement. We have determined that we are acting as principal when we manage all aspects of a social media campaign, including\nreviewing and approving target audiences, monitoring actual results and making modifications as needed and when we are responsible for delivering campaign results to our customers regardless of the use of a third-party or parties. \nTrade and Barter Transactions  In broadcasting,\ntrade or barter agreements are commonly used to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services. We may enter barter agreements to exchange airtime or digital advertising for goods or services that can be used in our\nbusiness or that can be sold to our audience under Listener Purchase Programs. The terms of these barter agreements permit us to preempt the barter airtime or digital campaign in favor of customers who purchase the airtime or digital campaign for\ncash. The value of these non-cash exchanges is included in revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the goods or services we receive. Each transaction must be reviewed to determine that the products,\nsupplies and/or services we receive have economic substance, or value to us. We record barter operating expenses upon receipt and usage of the products, supplies and services, as applicable. We record barter revenue as advertising spots or digital\ncampaigns are delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Barter revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which\ncase, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency.  Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \nApproximately 65% of our total assets at December 31, 2020 consisted of indefinite-lived intangible assets including broadcast licenses and goodwill.\nThese indefinite-lived intangible assets originated from acquisitions in which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcast licenses and goodwill. We do not amortize indefinite-lived intangible assets, but rather test for\nimpairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. We perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, which coincides with our budget and planning process for the\nupcoming year.  Impairment testing requires an estimate of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. We believe that these estimates of\nfair value are critical accounting estimates as the value is significant in relation to our total assets and the estimates incorporate variables and assumptions based on our experiences and judgment about our future operating performance. Fair value\nmeasurements use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value, including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the\nassumptions and estimates used in our estimates, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. The unobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures as\nLevel 3 inputs discussed in Note 13 of our Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  The first step of our impairment testing is to perform a\nqualitative assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. This qualitative assessment requires significant judgment \n  48 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nwhen considering the events and circumstances that may affect the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. These events and circumstances are not all-inclusive and are not by themselves indicators of impairment. We consider external and internal factors when reviewing the following events and circumstances, which are presented in the order of what we believe\nto be the strongest to weakest indicators of impairment:   \n\n\n \n(1)\n the difference between any recent fair value calculations and the carrying value; \n \n\n\n \n(2)\n financial performance, such as station operating income, including performance as compared to projected results\nused in prior estimates of fair value;   \n\n\n \n(3)\n macroeconomic economic conditions, including limitations on accessing capital that could affect the discount\nrates used in prior estimates of fair value;   \n\n\n \n(4)\n industry and market considerations such as a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in\ndemand, competition, or other economic factors;   \n\n\n \n(5)\n operating cost factors, such as increases in labor, that could have a negative effect on future expected\nearnings and cash flows;   \n\n\n \n(6)\n legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors; \n \n\n\n \n(7)\n other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management or customers; and \n \n\n\n \n(8)\n any changes to the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. \nIf it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, we are required to perform a second step to preparing a quantitative analysis to estimate the fair or\nenterprise value of the assets. We did not find reconciliation to our current market capitalization meaningful in the determination of our enterprise value given current factors that impact our market capitalization, including but not limited to:\nlimited trading volume, the impact of our publishing segment operating losses and the significant voting control of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We engage an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm to assist us with\ndetermining the enterprise value as part of our quantitative review.  If the results of our quantitative analysis indicate that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. \nWe believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, however, these\nestimates and assumptions are highly judgmental in nature. Actual results can be materially different from estimates and assumptions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or by us, or if events occur or\ncircumstances change that would reduce the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets below the amounts reflected on our balance sheet, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. \nSensitivity of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \nWhen estimating the fair value of broadcast licenses and goodwill, we make assumptions regarding future revenue growth rates, operating cash flow margins and\ndiscount rates. These assumptions require substantial judgment that may differ materially from actual results. The following sensitivity analysis shows the incremental impact and the hypothetical non-cash\nimpairment charge that would have result if our estimates were to change by 100 basis points as of the annual testing period in the fourth quarter of 2020:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nSensitivity Analysis (1)\n \n\n \n  \nIncrease in Risk-Adjusted Discount Rate\n \n  \nDecrease in OperatingProfit Margins\n \n  \nDecrease in Long-TermRevenue Growth Rates\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Incremental broadcast licenses impairment\n  \n$\n13,302\n \n  \n$\n—  \n \n  \n$\n4,132\n \n\n Incremental goodwill impairment\n  \n \n862\n \n  \n \n648\n \n  \n \n317\n \n\n  49 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n(1)\n Each assumption used in the sensitivity analysis is independent of the other assumptions.\n The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) developed based on data from same or\nsimilar industry participants and publicly available market data as of the measurement date. The same discount rate was used in each of our broadcast markets. The discount rate applied to our digital media and publishing entities was higher given\nthe perceived additional risks associated with the cash flows of these businesses.  Operating profit margin is defined as operating income before\ninterest, depreciation, amortization, income tax and corporate allocation charges divided by net revenue. For the fair value analysis, the projections of operating profit margin that are used are based upon industry expectations. These margin\nprojections are not specific to the performance of our radio stations or segments in a market but are predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to a typical\ncompetitor. If actual future margins are lower than our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.  For\nthe goodwill fair value analysis, the projections of operating margin for each broadcast market and each entity are based on our historical performance. If the future outlook for the broadcast, digital or publishing industry growth declines by more\nthan our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.  Long-term revenue growth rates are determined from\npublicly available information on industry expectations rather than our own estimates, which could differ. Long-term revenue growth rates can vary for each of our broadcast markets. Using industry expectations, each broadcast market, digital and\npublishing entity’s revenue was forecasted over a ten-year projection period to reflect the projected long-term growth rate. If the future outlook for the broadcast, digital or publishing industry growth\ndeclines by more than our estimates, we may recognize future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material.  Business Acquisitions\n We account for business acquisitions in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting as specified in FASB ASC Topic 805 Business\nCombinations. The total acquisition consideration is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the transaction. Estimates of the fair value include discounted estimated cash flows\nto be generated by the assets and their expected useful lives based on historical experience, market trends and any synergies believed to be achieved from the acquisition. The excess of consideration paid over the estimated fair values of the net\nassets acquired is recorded as goodwill and any excess of fair value of the net assets acquired over the consideration paid is recorded as a gain on bargain purchase. Prior to recording a gain, the acquiring entity must reassess whether all acquired\nassets and assumed liabilities have been identified and recognized and perform re-measurements to verify that the consideration paid, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed have been properly valued. \nAcquisitions may include contingent earn-out consideration, the fair value of which is estimated as of the acquisition\ndate as the present value of the expected contingent payments as determined using weighted probabilities of the payment amounts.  A majority of our radio\nstation acquisitions have consisted primarily of the FCC licenses to broadcast in a particular market. We often do not acquire the existing format, or we change the format upon acquisition when we find it beneficial. As a result, a substantial\nportion of the purchase price for the assets of a radio station is allocated to the broadcast license. Under ASU 2017-01, a fewer number of our radio station acquisitions qualify as business acquisitions and\ninstead are accounted for as asset purchases. Asset purchases are recognized based on their cost to acquire, including transaction costs. The cost to acquire an asset group is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair\nvalue with no goodwill recognized. \n  50 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe may retain a third-party appraiser to estimate the fair value of the acquired net assets as of the\nacquisition date. As part of the valuation and appraisal process, the third-party appraiser prepares a report assigning estimated fair values to the various asset categories in our financial statements. These fair value estimates are subjective in\nnature and require careful consideration and judgment. Management reviews the third-party reports for reasonableness of the assigned values. We believe that the purchase price allocations represent the appropriate estimated fair value of the assets\nacquired and we have not had to modify our purchase price allocations.  We estimate the economic life of each tangible and intangible asset acquired to\ndetermine the period of time in which the asset should be depreciated or amortized. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the economic life of each asset. We consider our own experience with similar assets, industry trends,\nmarket conditions and the age of the property at the time of our acquisition to estimate the economic life of each asset. If the financial condition of the assets were to deteriorate, the resulting change in life or impairment of the asset could\ncause a material impact and volatility in our operating results. To date, we have not experienced changes in the economic life established for each major category of our assets. \nContingent Earn-Out Consideration \nOur acquisitions often include contingent earn-out consideration as part of the purchase price. The fair value of the\ncontingent earn-out consideration is estimated as of the acquisition date based on the present value of the contingent payments expected to be made using a weighted probability of possible payments. The\nunobservable inputs used in the determination of the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration include our own assumptions about the likelihood of payment based on the established benchmarks and\ndiscount rates based on our internal rate of return analysis. The fair value measurements include inputs that are Level 3 measurement as discussed in Note 13 in the notes of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 in this\nannual report.  We review the probabilities of possible future payments to the estimated fair value of any contingent\nearn-out consideration on a quarterly basis over the earn-out period. Actual results are compared to the estimates and probabilities of achievement used in our\nforecasts. Should actual results increase or decrease as compared to the assumption used in our analysis, the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration obligations will increase or decrease, up to\nthe contracted limit, as applicable. Changes in the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration could cause a material impact and volatility in our operating results. The changes in our estimates\nreflect volatility from variables, such as revenue growth, page views and session time  We believe that we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions\nto calculate the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration however, these estimates and assumptions are highly judgmental in nature. Actual results can be materially different from estimates\nand assumptions.  Fair Value Measurements \nFASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures established a single definition of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles\nand requires expanded disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. The provision applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This includes applying the fair value concept to\n(i) nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in business combinations; (ii) reporting units or nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in conjunction with goodwill impairment testing;\n(iii) other nonfinancial assets measured at fair value in conjunction with impairment assessments; and (iv) asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value. \nThe fair value provisions include guidance on how to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities in the current economic environment and reemphasize\nthat the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price. If \n  51 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nwe were to conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities, quoted market values may not\nbe representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. \nThe degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Pricing\nobservability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market, and the characteristics specific to the transaction. Financial instruments with readily available\nactive quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments\nrarely traded or not quoted will generally have less (or no) pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value.  FASB\nASC Topic 820 established a hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring fair value. This framework defined three levels of inputs to the fair value measurement process and requires that\neach fair value measurement be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three broad levels of inputs defined by the FASB ASC Topic 820 hierarchy are as\nfollows:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Level 1 Inputs—quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that\nthe reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Level 2 Inputs—inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Level 3 Inputs—unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. These unobservable inputs reflect the\nentity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (which might include the reporting entity’s\nown data).  We believe that we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our financial\nassets as discussed in Note 13 in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this annual report.  Contingency\nReserves  In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits, arbitration and other claims that are complex\nin nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or the financial impact with respect to these matters. Certain of these proceedings are\ndiscussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, contained in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  We record contingency reserves to the extent we\nconclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. The establishment of the reserve is based on a review of all relevant factors, the advice of legal counsel, and the\nsubjective judgment of management. The reserves we have recorded to date have not been material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our\nreserves are accurately reflected.  While we believe that the final resolution of any known matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, it is \n  52 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\npossible that we could incur additional losses. We maintain insurance that may provide coverage for such matters. Future claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could have a material\nadverse effect upon our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including losses due to costly litigation and losses due to matters that require significant amounts of management time that can result in the diversion of\nsignificant operational resources.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts \nWe evaluate the balance reserved in our allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis based on our historical collection experience, the age of the\nreceivables, specific customer information and current economic conditions. We increased our reserve percentages during 2020 based on the adverse economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and\nthe expected impact on the ability of our customers to make payments. Past due balances are generally not written-off until all collection efforts have been unsuccessful, including use of a collection agency.\nA considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current creditworthiness of each customer. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,\nresulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe\nthat our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.  Sales Returns and Allowances \nWe provide for estimated returns for products sold with the right of return, primarily book sales associated with Regnery® Publishing and nutritional products sold through our wellness division. We record an estimate of these product returns as a reduction of revenue in the period of the sale. Our estimates are based\nupon historical sales returns, the amount of current period sales, economic trends and any changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. We regularly monitor actual performance to estimated return rates and make adjustments as\nnecessary. Estimated return rates utilized for establishing estimated returns reserves have approximated actual returns experience. However, actual returns may differ significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from these estimates if factors\nsuch as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and/or the market. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not\nhistorically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected. \nInventory Reserves  Inventories consist of\npublished books from Regnery® Publishing. Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value as determined on a First-In First-Out cost method. We review historical data and our own experiences to estimate the fair value of inventory on hand. Our analysis includes reviewing actual sales returns, allowance estimates, royalty reserves,\noverall economic conditions and demand for each title. We record a provision to expense the balance of unsold inventory that we believe to be unrecoverable. We regularly monitor actual performance to our estimates and make adjustments as necessary.\nEstimated inventory reserves may be adjusted, either favorably or unfavorably, if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the\ncustomer and/or the market. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves\nare accurately reflected.  Reserves for Royalty Advances \nRoyalties are paid in advance to book authors and capitalized as prepaid assets. Royalties are expensed as the related book revenue is earned or when we\ndetermine that future recovery of the royalty is not likely. We review \n  53 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nhistorical data associated with royalty advances, earnings and recoverability based on actual results of Regnery® Publishing.\nHistorically, the longer the unearned portion of an advance remains outstanding, the less likely it is that we will recover the advance through sales of the book. We apply this historical experience to outstanding royalty advances to estimate the\nlikelihood of recovery. A provision is established to expense the balance of any unearned advance which we believe is not recoverable. Our analysis also considers other discrete factors, such as death of an author, any decision to not pursue\npublication of a title, poor market demand and other relevant factors. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and\nassumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.  Fair Value of Equity Awards \nWe account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation. We record equity awards with\nstock-based compensation measured at the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We determine the fair value of each award using the Black-Scholes valuation model that requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected\nstock price volatility and the expected term of the award granted. The exercise price for each award is equal to or greater than the closing market price of Salem Media Group, Inc. common stock as of the date of the award. We use the straight-line\nattribution method to recognize share-based compensation costs over the expected service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of the award, deferred tax assets for awards with multiple vesting dates are\neliminated for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period was a separate award. We have not modified our estimates or assumptions used\nin our valuation model. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our stock-based compensation is accurately reflected in our results of operations. \nPartial Self-Insurance on Employee Health Plan  We\nprovide health insurance benefits to eligible employees under a self-insured plan whereby we pay actual medical claims subject to certain stop loss limits. We record self-insurance liabilities based on actual claims filed and an estimate of those\nclaims incurred but not reported. Our estimates are based on historical data and probabilities. Any projection of losses concerning our liability is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable\nexternal factors such as future inflation rates, changes in severity, benefit level changes, medical costs and claim settlement patterns. Should the actual amount of claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated, we may adjust our future\nreserves. Our self-insurance liability was $0.5 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant\nlosses from changes in our estimates.  Leases \nWe account for leases under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”). We consider all relevant facts and\ncircumstances to determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception. Our analysis includes whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. This\nconsideration involves judgment with respect to whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of the identified asset. \nLease Term – Impact on Right-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities\n The lease term can materially impact the value of the Right-of-Use\n(“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities recorded on our balance sheet as required under ASC 842. We calculate the term for each lease agreement to include the noncancellable period specified in the agreement together with (1) the periods\ncovered by options to extend the \n  54 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nlease if we are reasonably certain to exercise that option, (2) periods covered by an option to terminate if we are reasonably certain not to exercise that option and (3) period covered\nby an option to extend (or not terminate) if controlled by the lessor. The assessment of whether we are reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease requires significant judgement surrounding contract-based factors, asset-based\nfactors, entity-based factors and market-based factors. These factors, detailed below, are evaluated based on the facts and circumstances at the time we enter a lease agreement. \nContract-Based Factors:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n The existence of a bargain renewal option \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n The existence of contingent or variable payments \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n The nature and terms of renewal or termination options \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n The costs the lessee would incur to restore the asset before returning it to the lessor \nAsset-Based Factors:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n The existence of significant lessee-installed leasehold improvements that would still have economic value when\nthe option becomes exercisable   \n\n\n \n•\n \n The physical location of the asset \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n The costs that would be incurred to replace or find an alternative asset \nEntity-Based Factors:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Historical practice   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Management’s intent \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Common industry practice \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n The financial impact on the entity of extending or terminating the lease \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n The importance of the leased asset to the entity’s operations \nMarket-Based Factors:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Market rental or purchase rates for comparable assets \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Potential implications of local regulations and statutory requirements \nWe have not modified our estimate methodology since adopting ASC 842 on January 1, 2019. \nIncremental Borrowing Rate  ROU assets and related\nlease liabilities recorded under ASC 842 are calculated based on the present value of the lease payments using (1) the rate implicit in the lease or (2) the lessee’s Incremental Borrowing Rate (“IBR”). IBR is defined as the\nrate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we estimate the IBR\napplicable to Salem using significant judgement and estimates, including the estimated value of the underlying leased asset, and the following available evidence: \nThe credit history of Salem Media Group \nOur most recent credit facility consists of 6.75% Senior Secured Notes and a revolving ABL Facility. As of each month end, the weighted average\ninterest rate on outstanding debt is calculated. \n  55 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe credit worthiness of Salem Media Group \nWe review our credit ratings from third parties, including Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. Both ratings were downgraded\nduring 2020 to poor quality with very high credit risk.  Class of the underlying asset and the remaining term of the arrangement \nWe use a portfolio approach applying a single IBR to all leases with reasonably similar characteristics, including the remaining lease term,\nthe underlying assets and the economic environment. We group leases according to the nature of leased asset and the lease term. We have six main categories of leases, (1) Buildings, (2) Equipment, (3) Land, (4) Other (Parking Facilities),\n(5) Towers and (6) Vehicles.  We consider vehicles to have a higher risk for collateral that is mitigated by the shorter term of the\nlease that would typically range from three to five years. We consider building and towers to have a higher risk based on (1) the longer lease term of up to thirty years and (2) a higher outstanding balance that is mitigated by the lower\nrisk that the collateralized asset would lose significant value.  The debt incurred under the lease liability as compared to amounts that\nwould be borrowed  We review the cost to finance comparable amounts under our ABL Facility and based on the current market environment as\nderived from available economic data.  We referred to the Bloomberg Single B Rated Communications Yield Curve (unsecured) and considered\nadjustments for industry risk factors and the estimated value of the underlying leased asset to be collateral for the debt incurred.  From these data\npoints, we develop a matrix to estimate the IBR for each lease class. We review the IBR estimates on a quarterly basis and update as necessary. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not recognized significant changes in our\nestimates.  Impairment of ROU Assets  ROU assets from\noperating and finance leases are subject to the impairment guidance in ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment consistent with other long-lived nonfinancial assets. ROU assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present.\n ROU assets are tested for impairment individually or as part of an asset group if the cash flows related to the ROU asset are not independent from the\ncash flows of other assets and liabilities. An asset group is the unit of accounting for long-lived assets to be held and used, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other\ngroups of assets and liabilities.  After a careful analysis of the guidance, we concluded that the appropriate unit of accounting for testing ROU assets\nfor impairment is the broadcast market cluster level for radio station operations and the entity or division level for digital media entities, publishing entities and networks. Corporate ROU assets are tested on a consolidated level with\nconsideration given to all cash flows of the company as corporate functions do not generate cash flows and are funded by revenue-producing activities at lower levels of the entity. \nASC 360 requires three steps to identify, recognize and measure the impairment of a long-lived asset (asset group) to be held and used: \nStep 1—Consider whether Indicators of Impairment are Present \nAs detailed in ASC\n360-10-35-21, the following are examples of impairment indicators: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n A significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset (asset group) \n  56 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n•\n \n A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or\nin its physical condition   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a\nlong-lived asset (asset group), including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator   \n\n\n \n•\n \n An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or\nconstruction of a long-lived asset (asset group)   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a\nprojection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset (asset group)   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise\ndisposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The term more likely than not refers to a level of likelihood that is more than 50 percent. \nOther indicators should be considered if we believe that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. \nStep 2—Test for Recoverability \nIf indicators of impairment are present, we are required to perform a recoverability test comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash\nflows attributable to the long-lived asset or asset group in question to the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group.  ASC\n360 does not specifically address how operating lease liabilities and future cash outflows for lease payments should be considered in the recoverability test. Under ASC 360, financial liabilities, or long-term debt, generally are excluded from an\nasset group while operating liabilities, such as accounts payable, generally are included. ASC 842 characterizes operating lease liabilities as operating liabilities. Because operating lease liabilities may be viewed as having attributes of finance\nliabilities as well as operating liabilities, it is generally acceptable for a lessee to either include or exclude operating lease liabilities from an asset group when testing whether the carrying amount of an asset group is recoverable provided the\napproach is applied consistently for all operating leases and when performing Steps 2 and 3 of the impairment model in ASC 360.  In cases\nwhere we have received lease incentives, including operating lease liabilities in an asset group may result in the long-lived asset or asset group having a zero or negative carrying amount because the incentives reduce our ROU assets. We elected to\nexclude operating lease liabilities from the carrying amount of the asset group such that we test ROU assets for operating leases in the same manner that we test ROU assets for financing leases. \nUndiscounted Future Cash Flows \nThe undiscounted future cash flows in Step 2 are based on our own assumptions rather than a market participant. If an election is made to\nexclude operating lease liabilities from the asset or asset group, all future cash lease payments for the lease should also be excluded. The standard requires lessees to exclude certain variable lease payments from lease payments and, therefore,\nfrom the measurement of a lessee’s lease liabilities. Because these variable payments do not reduce the lease liability, we include the variable payments we expect to make in our estimate of the undiscounted cash flows in the recoverability\ntest (Step 2) using a probability-weighted approach.  Step 3—Measurement of an Impairment Loss \nIf the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset (asset group), we are\nrequired to estimate the fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group and \n  57 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nrecognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value. We elected to exclude operating lease liabilities from the estimated\nfair value, consistent with the recoverability test. Any impairment loss for an asset group must reduce only the carrying amounts of a long-lived asset or assets of the group, including the ROU assets. The loss must be allocated to the long-lived\nassets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group must not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value\nwhenever the fair value is determinable without undue cost and effort. ASC 360 prohibits the subsequent reversal of an impairment loss for an asset held and used. \nFair Value Considerations \nWhen determining the fair value of a ROU asset, we must estimate what market participants would pay to lease the asset or what a market\nparticipant would pay up front in one payment for the ROU asset, assuming no additional lease payments would be due. The ROU asset must be valued assuming its highest and best use, in its current form, even if that use differs from the current or\nintended use. If no market exists for an asset in its current form, but there is a market for a transformed asset, the costs to transform the asset are considered in the fair value estimate. Refer to Note 13, Fair Value Measurements. \nThere were no indications of impairment during the period ended December 31, 2020. \nIncome Tax Valuation Allowances (Deferred Taxes) \nIn preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by\nestimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for\nincome tax consider current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of audits conducted by tax authorities. Reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by\ntax authorities are established if necessary. Although we believe our judgments, assumptions and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any future tax audits could significantly impact\nthe amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.  We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates\nand assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the tax\nimplications are known. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted.  We record a\nvaluation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated\nwith estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred\ntax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets\nwould be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance.  As a result of our adjusted cumulative\nthree-year pre-tax book loss as of December 31, 2020, we performed quarterly assessments of positive and negative evidence with respect to the realization of our net deferred tax assets. This assessment\nincluded the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the availability of carryforwards and estimates of projected future taxable income. The economic uncertainty from the \n  58 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic provided additional negative evidence that outweighed positive evidence resulting in our conclusion that additional deferred tax assets\nof $35.1 million related to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are more likely than not to be not realized. As such, an additional valuation allowance of $35.1 million was recorded, for a total valuation allowance of\n$48.1 million as of the year ended December 31, 2020.  Income Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions \nWe are subject to audit and review by various taxing jurisdictions. We may recognize liabilities on our financial statements for positions taken on uncertain\ntax positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others may be subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount\nof the position that would be ultimately sustained. Such positions are deemed to be unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding liability is established on the balance sheet. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as\nthis requires us to make estimates based on the various possible outcomes. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not\nthat the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.  We review and reevaluate\nuncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Changes in assumptions may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized liabilities associated with\nuncertain tax positions around our subsidiary Salem Communications Holding Company’s Pennsylvania tax filing. The position taken on the tax returns follows Pennsylvania Notice 2016-01 which provides\nguidance for reversal of intercompany interest income and associated expense yielding a net loss for Pennsylvania. The current liability recognized for the tax position is $0.3 million including interest and penalties. Our evaluation was\nperformed for all tax years that remain subject to examination, which range from 2016 through 2019.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements \nRecent accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements. \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Our principal sources of\nfunds are operating cash flows, borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from the sale of selected assets or businesses. We have historically funded, and will continue to fund, expenditures for operations, administrative expenses, and capital\nexpenditures from these sources. We have historically financed acquisitions through borrowings, including borrowings under credit facilities and, to a lesser extent, from operating cash flow and from proceeds on selected asset dispositions. We\nexpect to fund future acquisitions from cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities, operating cash flow and possibly through the sale of income-producing assets or proceeds from debt and equity offerings. \nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. We experienced\ndeclining revenue from advertising, programming, events and book sales. Several advertisers reduced or ceased advertising spend due to the outbreak and stay-at-home\norders that effectively shut many businesses down. This was particularly true within our broadcast segment, which derives substantial revenue from local advertisers who have been particularly hard hit due to social distancing and government\ninterventions and in our publishing segment that sells books in retail stores and through live events.  Future availability under our credit facility is\ncontingent upon our eligible receivable balance, which is negatively impacted by lower revenue and longer days to collect. Availability under our ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of (a) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable\nplus (b) a calculated amount based on \n  59 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nthe value of certain real property. The maximum amount available under our ABL Facility declined to $24.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $26.4 million at December 31, 2019,\nof which $5.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2020 compared to $12.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019.  In response to\nthese developments, beginning in March 2020, we implemented several measures to reduce costs and conserve cash to ensure that we have adequate cash to meet our debt servicing requirements, including: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n limiting capital expenditures; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n reducing discretionary spending, including travel and entertainment; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n eliminating open positions and freezing new hires; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n reducing staffing levels; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n implementing temporary company-wide pay cuts of 5%, 7.5% or 10% depending on salary level; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n furloughing certain employees; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n temporarily suspending the company 401(k) match; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n requesting rent concessions from landlords; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n requesting discounts from vendors; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n offering early payment discounts to certain customers in exchange for advance cash payments; and\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n suspending the payment of distributions on our common stock indefinitely. \nWe have utilized certain benefits of the CARES Act, and we may be entitled to benefits under the CAA based on our individual locations, including: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n the deferral of all employer FICA taxes beginning in April 2020 for the remainder of 2020, with 50% payable in\nDecember 2021 and the remainder payable in December 2022;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n relaxation of interest expense deduction limitation for income tax purposes; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Payroll Protection Plan (“PPP”) loans available based on the eligibility determined on a per-location basis of up to $11.2 million on a consolidated basis.  Due to the adverse economic\nimpact, we reforecast our anticipated results extending through March 2022. Our reforecast includes the impact of certain of these cost-cutting measures. Based on our current and expected economic outlook and our current and expected funding needs,\nwe believe that the borrowing capacity under our current credit facilities, together with cash on hand, allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund necessary capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service requirements for at least\nthe next twelve months, including the working capital deficit at December 31, 2020. Based on our current assessment, we believe that we have the ability to meet our obligations as they come due for one year from the issuance of this annual\nreport.  During 2020 we began to keep higher balances of cash and cash equivalents on-hand to meet operating needs\ndue to the adverse economic conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, we keep the balance of cash and cash equivalents low in order to reduce the balance of outstanding debt. Our ABL Facility\nautomatically covers any shortfalls in operating cash flows such that we are not required to hold excess cash balances on hand. Our cash and cash equivalents increased to $6.3 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $6,000 at\nDecember 31, 2019. Working capital increased $6.3 million to $(5.1) million at December 31, 2020 compared to ($11.4 million) at December 31, 2019 due to the $6.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, a\n$3.2 million increase in assets held for sale and a $7.4 million decrease in the outstanding balance on the ABL Facility, that was partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable of $6.4 million, an increase in contract\nliabilities of $2.2 million. \n  60 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOperating Cash Flows \nOur largest source of operating cash inflows are receipts from customers in exchange for advertising and programming. Other sources of operating cash inflows\ninclude receipts from customers for digital downloads and streaming, book sales, subscriptions, self-publishing fees, ticket sales, sponsorships, and vendor promotions. The adverse economic impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our revenue and cash receipts from customers. A majority of our operating cash outflows consist of payments to employees, such as salaries and benefits, and vendor\npayments under facility and tower leases, talent agreements, inventory purchases and recurring services such as utilities and music license fees. Our operating cash flows are subject to factors such as fluctuations in preferred advertising media and\nchanges in demand caused by shifts in population, station listenership, demographics, and audience tastes. In addition, our operating cash flows may be affected if our customers are unable to pay, delay payment of amounts owed to us, or if we\nexperience reductions in revenue, or increases in costs and expenses.  Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $5.8 million during the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 to $22.8 million from $17.0 million during the prior year. The increase in cash provided by operating activities includes the impact of the following items: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Trade accounts receivables, net of allowances, decreased by $6.4 million compared to a decrease of\n$2.2 million for the prior year;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Operating expenses exclusive of depreciation, amortization, changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, impairments and net gain (loss) on the disposition of assets, decreased by $6.6 million;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Unbilled revenue increased $0.2 million; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Our Day’s Sales Outstanding, or the average number of days to collect cash from the date of sale, decreased\nto 59 days at December 31, 2020 from 60 days in the same period of the prior year;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n We deferred cash payments of $3.3 million for the employer portion of FICA taxes as allowed under the CARES\nAct with 50% due December 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 2022; and   \n\n\n \n•\n \n We reduced cash paid for rent by $1.0 million of which $0.3 million was abated and $0.7 million\nwas deferred over pay-back periods ranging from one-month in 2020 to forty-four months through December 2024. \nInvesting Cash Flows  Our primary source of investing\ncash inflows includes proceeds from the sale of assets or businesses. Investing cash outflows include cash payments made to acquire businesses, to acquire property and equipment and to acquire intangible assets such as domain names. While our focus\ncontinues to be on deleveraging, we remain committed to explore and pursue strategic acquisitions.  In recent years, we entered acquisition agreements\nthat contain contingent earn-out arrangements that are payable in the future based on the achievement of predefined operating results. We believe that these contingent\nearn-out arrangements provide some degree of protection with regard to our cash outflows should these acquisitions not meet our operational expectations. \nWe undertake projects from time to time to upgrade our radio station technical facilities and/or FCC broadcast licenses, expand our digital and web-based offerings, improve our facilities and upgrade our computer infrastructures. The nature and timing of these upgrades and expenditures can be delayed or scaled back at the discretion of management. Based on\nour current plans, we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $11.6 million during 2021. As noted, we are currently limiting capital expenditures to emergency-only type expenses. \n  61 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe plan to fund any future purchases and any future acquisitions from cash on hand, operating cash flow or\nour credit facilities.  Net cash used in investing activities was $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash\nprovided by investing activities of $10.9 million during the prior year. The $13.8 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was the result of:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Proceeds from the sale of assets decreased $20.5 million to $0.2 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 compared to $20.7 million of cash during same period of the prior year;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Proceeds of $2.4 million were received from surrendering split-dollar life insurance policies;\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n Cash paid for capital expenditures decreased $3.2 million to $4.6 million from $7.8 million during\nthe same period of the prior year; and   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Cash paid for acquisitions decreased $0.9 million to $0.4 million compared to $1.3 million during\nthe same period of the prior year.  Financing Cash Flows \nFinancing cash inflows include borrowings under our credit facilities and any proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under our stock incentive\nplan. Financing cash outflows include repayments of our credit facilities, the payment of distributions on our common stock and payments of amounts due under deferred installments and contingency earn-out\nconsideration associated with acquisition activity.  During the year ended December 31, 2020, the aggregate principal balances outstanding under the\nNotes and ABL Facility ranged from $221.3 million to $235.4 million. These outstanding balances were ordinary and customary based on our operating and investing cash needs during this time. \nOur sole source of cash available for making any future distributions on our common stock is our operating cash flow, subject to our credit facilities and\nNotes, which contain covenants that restrict the payment of dividends and distributions to our equity holders unless certain specified conditions are satisfied. On May 6, 2020 our Board voted to discontinue distributions on our common stock\nindefinitely due to the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. \nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $14.4 million to $13.6 million compared to\n$28.0 million during the prior year. The decrease in cash used for financing activities includes:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A $5.1 million decrease in cash distributions on common stock to $0.7 million from $5.8 million,\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n Net payments on our ABL Facility were $7.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to\nnet payments of $7.2 million during the prior year; and   \n\n\n \n•\n \n We used $3.4 million of cash to repurchase $3.5 million in face value of the 6.75% Senior Secured Notes\ncompared to $16.8 million of cash to repurchase $18.7 million during the prior year.  6.75% Senior Secured Notes \nOn May 19, 2017, we issued the Notes in a private placement. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by our existing subsidiaries (the\n“Subsidiary Guarantors”). The Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per year and mature on June 1, 2024, unless they are earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest initially accrued on the Notes from May 19, 2017 and is payable\nsemi-annually, in cash in arrears, on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2017.  The Notes are secured by a\nfirst-priority lien on substantially all assets of ours and the Subsidiary Guarantors other than the ABL Facility Priority Collateral (as described below) (the “Notes Priority Collateral”). There is no\n\n  62 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ndirect lien on our FCC licenses to the extent prohibited by law or regulation (other than the economic value and proceeds thereof). \nThe Notes were redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or before June 1, 2020 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus\na “make-whole” premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. At any time on or after June 1, 2020, the Notes are redeemable at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of\nthe principal amount to be redeemed) set forth in the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.  The\nindenture relating to the Notes (the “Indenture”) contains covenants that, among other things and subject in each case to certain specified exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur\nadditional debt; (ii) declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders; (iii) make investments; (iv) create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; (v) merge or consolidate, or\nsell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets; (vi) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (vii) sell or transfer assets. \nThe Indenture provides for the following events of default (each, an “Event of Default”): (i) default in payment of principal or premium on the\nNotes at maturity, upon repurchase, acceleration, optional redemption or otherwise; (ii) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the Notes; (iii) the failure by us or certain restricted subsidiaries to comply with other agreements in\nthe Indenture or the Notes, in certain cases subject to notice and lapse of time; (iv) the failure of any guarantee by certain significant Subsidiary Guarantors to be in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms,\nsubject to notice and lapse of time; (v) certain accelerations (including failure to pay within any grace period) of other indebtedness of ours or any restricted subsidiary if the amount accelerated (or so unpaid) is at least $15 million;\n(vi) certain judgments for the payment of money in excess of $15 million; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us or any significant subsidiary; and (viii) certain defaults with respect to any\ncollateral having a fair market value in excess of $15 million. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal of the Notes and\nany accrued interest on the Notes to be due and payable immediately, subject to remedy or cure in certain cases. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Notes being due and payable immediately upon\nthe occurrence of such Events of Default. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under the Indenture. \nBased on the balance of the Notes currently outstanding, we are required to pay $14.6 million per year in interest on the Notes. As of December 31,\n2020, accrued interest on the Notes was $1.2 million.  We incurred debt issuance costs of $6.3 million that were recorded as a reduction of the\ndebt proceeds that are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the life of the Notes using the effective interest method. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.7 million and\n$0.9 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs associated with the Notes was amortized to interest expense.  We may from time to time, depending\non market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, seek to repurchase the Notes in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, as market conditions\nwarrant. \n  63 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBased on the then existing market conditions, we completed repurchases of our 6.75% Senior Secured Notes at\namounts less than face value as follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Date\n \nPrincipalRepurchased\n \n \nCash Paid\n \n \n% of FaceValue\n \n \nBond IssueCosts\n \n \nNet Gain\n \n\n \n \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\nJanuary 30, 2020\n \n$\n2,250\n \n \n$\n2,194\n \n \n \n97.50\n% \n \n$\n34\n \n \n$\n 22\n \n\nJanuary 27, 2020\n \n \n1,245\n \n \n \n1,198\n \n \n \n96.25\n% \n \n \n20\n \n \n \n27\n \n\nDecember 27, 2019\n \n \n3,090\n \n \n \n2,874\n \n \n \n93.00\n% \n \n \n48\n \n \n \n167\n \n\nNovember 27, 2019\n \n \n5,183\n \n \n \n4,548\n \n \n \n87.75\n% \n \n \n82\n \n \n \n553\n \n\nNovember 15, 2019\n \n \n3,791\n \n \n \n3,206\n \n \n \n84.58\n% \n \n \n61\n \n \n \n524\n \n\nMarch 28, 2019\n \n \n2,000\n \n \n \n1,830\n \n \n \n91.50\n% \n \n \n37\n \n \n \n134\n \n\nMarch 28, 2019\n \n \n2,300\n \n \n \n2,125\n \n \n \n92.38\n% \n \n \n42\n \n \n \n133\n \n\nFebruary 20, 2019\n \n \n125\n \n \n \n114\n \n \n \n91.25\n% \n \n \n2\n \n \n \n9\n \n\nFebruary 19, 2019\n \n \n350\n \n \n \n319\n \n \n \n91.25\n% \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n24\n \n\nFebruary 12, 2019\n \n \n1,325\n \n \n \n1,209\n \n \n \n91.25\n% \n \n \n25\n \n \n \n91\n \n\nJanuary 10, 2019\n \n \n570\n \n \n \n526\n \n \n \n92.25\n% \n \n \n9\n \n \n \n35\n \n\nDecember 21, 2018\n \n \n2,000\n \n \n \n1,835\n \n \n \n91.75\n% \n \n \n38\n \n \n \n127\n \n\nDecember 21, 2018\n \n \n1,850\n \n \n \n1,702\n \n \n \n92.00\n% \n \n \n35\n \n \n \n113\n \n\nDecember 21, 2018\n \n \n1,080\n \n \n \n999\n \n \n \n92.50\n% \n \n \n21\n \n \n \n60\n \n\nNovember 17, 2018\n \n \n1,500\n \n \n \n1,357\n \n \n \n90.50\n% \n \n \n29\n \n \n \n114\n \n\nMay 4, 2018\n \n \n4,000\n \n \n \n3,770\n \n \n \n94.25\n% \n \n \n86\n \n \n \n144\n \n\nApril 10, 2018\n \n \n4,000\n \n \n \n3,850\n \n \n \n96.25\n% \n \n \n87\n \n \n \n63\n \n\nApril 9, 2018\n \n \n2,000\n \n \n \n1,930\n \n \n \n96.50\n% \n \n \n43\n \n \n \n27\n \n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n\n\n \n$\n 38,659\n \n \n$\n 35,586\n \n \n\n\n\n \n$\n 706\n \n \n$\n 2,367\n \n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility \nOn May 19, 2017, the company entered into the ABL Facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) by and among us and our\nsubsidiaries party thereto as borrowers, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and lead arranger, and the lenders that are parties thereto. We used the proceeds of the ABL Facility, together with the net proceeds from the\nNotes offering, to repay outstanding borrowings under our previously existing senior credit facilities, and related fees and expenses. Current proceeds from the ABL Facility are used to provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate\npurposes, including permitted acquisitions.  The ABL Facility is a five-year $30.0 million revolving credit facility due March 1, 2024, which\nincludes a $5.0 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a $7.5 million subfacility for swingline loans. All borrowings under the ABL Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to a base rate or LIBOR plus a spread. The spread,\nwhich is based on an availability-based measure, ranges from 0.50% to 1.00% for base rate borrowings and 1.50% to 2.00% for LIBOR borrowings. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate may increase by 2.00% per annum. Amounts outstanding under\nthe ABL Facility may be paid and then reborrowed at our discretion without penalty or premium. Additionally, we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance from 0.25% to 0.375% per year based on the level of borrowings. \nOn October 20, 2020, we entered into a fourth amendment to our ABL Facility that provides a one-time waiver with\nrespect to the current covenant testing period allowing the covenant trigger event date be the first day after the availability on the ABL Facility had equaled or exceeded (1) 15% of the maximum revolver amount and (2) $4.5 million and a waiver\npermitting our July 2020 financial statements to be issued on or before September 30, 2020 due to delays that were caused by a ransomware attack.  On\nApril 7, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to ABL Facility that increased the advance rate on eligible accounts receivable from 85% to 90% and extended the maturity date from May 19, 2022 to March 1, 2024. The\n\n  64 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nApril 7, 2020 amendment also allows for an alternative benchmark rate that may include SOFR due to LIBOR being scheduled to be discontinued at the end of calendar year 2021. \nAvailability under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of (a) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount\nbased on the value of certain real property. As of December 31, 2020, the amount available under the ABL Facility was $24.2 million of which $5.0 million was outstanding. The ABL Facility has a first-priority lien on our and the\nSubsidiary Guarantors’ accounts receivable, inventory, deposit and securities accounts, certain real estate and related assets (the “ABL Facility Priority Collateral”) and by a second-priority lien on the Notes Priority Collateral.\nThere is no direct lien on our FCC licenses to the extent prohibited by law or regulation (other than the economic value and proceeds thereof).  The\nCredit Agreement includes a springing fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0, which is tested during the period commencing on the last day of the fiscal month most recently ended prior to the date on which Availability (as defined in the Credit\nAgreement) is less than the greater of 15% of the Maximum Revolver Amount (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and $4.5 million and continuing for a period of 60 consecutive days after the first day on which Availability exceeds such threshold\namount. The Credit Agreement also includes other negative covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this type, including covenants that, subject to exceptions described in the Credit Agreement, restrict our ability and the ability of our\nsubsidiaries (i) to incur additional indebtedness; (ii) to make investments; (iii) to make distributions, loans or transfers of assets; (iv) to enter into, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any liens, (v) to sell\nassets; (vi) to enter into transactions with affiliates; (vii) to merge or consolidate with, or dispose of all assets to a third party, except as permitted thereby; (viii) to prepay indebtedness; and (ix) to pay dividends. \nThe Credit Agreement provides for the following events of default: (i) default for non-payment of any principal\nor letter of credit reimbursement when due or any interest, fees or other amounts within five days of the due date; (ii) the failure by any borrower or any subsidiary to comply with any covenant or agreement contained in the Credit Agreement or\nany other loan document, in certain cases subject to applicable notice and lapse of time; (iii) any representation or warranty made pursuant to the Credit Agreement or any other loan document is incorrect in any material respect when made;\n(iv) certain defaults of other indebtedness of any borrower or any subsidiary of indebtedness of at least $10 million; (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to any borrower or any subsidiary; (vi) certain\njudgments for the payment of money of $10 million or more; (vii) a change of control; and (viii) certain defaults relating to the loss of FCC licenses, cessation of broadcasting and termination of material station contracts. If an\nevent of default occurs and is continuing, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may accelerate the amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we\nremain, in compliance with all of the covenants under Credit Agreement.  We incurred debt issue costs of $0.9 million that were recorded as an asset\nand are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the term of the ABL Facility using the effective interest method. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.2 million of\ndebt issuance costs associated with the ABL Facility was amortized to interest expense. At December 31, 2020, the blended interest rate on amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility was 2.5%. \nWe report outstanding balances on the ABL Facility as short-term regardless of the maturity date based on use of the ABL Facility to fund ordinary and\ncustomary operating cash needs with frequent repayments. We believe that our borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service requirements for at\nleast the next twelve months. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Agreement. \n  65 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSummary of long-term debt obligations \nLong-term debt consisted of the following:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nAs of December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n2019\n \n  \n2020\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n 6.75% Senior Secured Notes\n  \n$\n219,836\n \n  \n$\n216,341\n \n\n Less unamortized debt issuance costs based on imputed interest rate of 7.08%\n  \n \n(3,368\n) \n  \n \n(2,577\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n 6.75% Senior Secured Notes net carrying value\n  \n \n216,468\n \n  \n \n213,764\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility principal outstanding\n  \n \n12,426\n \n  \n \n5,000\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Long-term debt less unamortized debt issuance costs\n  \n \n228,894\n \n  \n \n218,764\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Less current portion\n  \n \n(12,426\n) \n  \n \n(5,000\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Long-term debt less unamortized debt issuance costs, net of current portion\n  \n$\n216,468\n \n  \n$\n213,764\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n In addition to the outstanding amounts listed above, we also have interest payments related to our long-term debt as follows\nas of December 31, 2020:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n $5.0 million under the ABL Facility, with interest spread ranging from Base Rate plus 0.50% to 1.00% for\nbase rate borrowings and LIBOR plus 1.50% to 2.00% for LIBOR borrowings;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n $216.3 million aggregate principal amount of Notes with semi-annual interest payments at an annual rate of\n6.75%; and   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375% per annum on the unused portion of the ABL Facility. \nMaturities of Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations \nPrincipal repayment requirements under all long-term debt agreements outstanding at December 31, 2020 for each of the next five years and thereafter are\nas follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nAmount\n \n\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n 2021\n  \n$\n5,000\n \n\n 2022\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n 2023\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n 2024\n  \n \n216,341\n \n\n 2025\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n Thereafter\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n\n  \n$\n221,341\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n Impairment Losses on Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \nWe have incurred impairment losses associated with goodwill and indefinite lived assets, including broadcast licenses and mastheads. These impairment losses\nwere attributable to declines in the projected long-term revenue growth rates for the broadcast, digital and publishing industries. The long-term revenue growth rates are specific for each market and ranged from 0.5%—1.2% as of the 2018 testing\nperiod to a range of 0.7%—1.1% as of the 2019 testing period resulting in a decline in operating profit margins from 4.4%—34.5% in 2018 to 4.0%—33.8% in 2019. Long-term revenue growth rates for digital media entities were 1.0% during\nthe 2018 annual testing to a range of 0.5%—1.0% as of the 2019 testing period while publishing long-term revenue growth rates \n  66 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nwere 1.0% during the 2018 annual testing period to 0.5% during the 2019 testing period. Declines in excess of these amounts and/or failure to achieve the anticipated growth rates may result in\nfuture impairment losses, the amount of which may be material.  The valuation of intangible assets is subjective and based on estimates rather than\nprecise calculations. If actual future results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future, the amount of which may be material. The fair value measurements for our\nindefinite-lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk. The unobservable inputs are\ndefined in FASB ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” as Level 3 inputs discussed in detail in Note 13 of our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this annual report. If actual future results\nare not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future, the amount of which may be material. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash\nflows of the respective market clusters and reporting units.  While the impairment charges we have recognized are\nnon-cash in nature and have not violated any debt covenants, the potential for future impairment charges can be viewed as a negative factor with regard to forecasted future performance and cash flows. We\nbelieve that we have adequately considered the potential for an economic downturn in our valuation models and do not believe that the non-cash impairments in and of themselves are a liquidity risk. \nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred\nto as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As\nsuch, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. \nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  Not required for smaller\nreporting companies.   \n\n\nITEM 7A.\n QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. \nNot required for smaller reporting companies. \n  67 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nITEM 8.

Camarillo, California  Opinion on the Financial\nStatements  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Salem Media Group, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020\nand 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial\nstatements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\ntwo years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Basis\nfor Opinion  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company\nin accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  We\nconducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matters  The critical audit matters communicated\nbelow are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial\nstatements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \nBroadcast License Impairment   As disclosed in\nNote 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated broadcast license balance was $319.8 million as of December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment on\nbroadcast licenses of $17.0 million. Management performs an annual impairment test \n  69 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nduring the fourth quarter of each year, which includes a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a broadcast license is impaired. This qualitative assessment requires\nsignificant judgment when considering the market conditions, events and circumstances that may affect the estimated fair value of broadcast licenses. If there are changes in market conditions, events, or other circumstances that occur during the\ninterim periods that indicate the carrying value of its broadcast licenses may be impaired, management determines whether an interim test is necessary. Broadcast licenses are assessed for recoverability at the market cluster level. Potential\nimpairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a market cluster’s broadcast licenses to the carrying value. Fair value is estimated by management using the Greenfield method, which is a form of the income approach, assuming a start-up scenario in which the only assets held by an investor are broadcasting licenses. Management’s cash flow projections for its broadcast licenses included significant judgments and assumptions relating to\nthe market share and profit margin of an average station within a market based upon market size and station type, the forecasted growth rate of each radio market (including long-term growth rate), and the discount rate. \nWe considered auditing broadcast license impairment to be a critical audit matter because it involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating\nmanagement’s estimates, judgments and assumptions, significant audit effort due to complexity in the aggregation and evaluation of significant amounts of data, and the use of valuation specialists. \nOur audit procedures related to broadcast license impairment included the following:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n evaluated management’s judgments in their assessment of identifying changes in market conditions, events or\nother circumstances that indicate an impairment of broadcast licenses may be present;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n tested the completeness, accuracy, appropriateness of aggregation and relevance of underlying data used in the\nvaluation model based on Greenfield method;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n evaluated the significant assumptions used by management, including normalized market share and profit margin of\nan average station within a market based upon market size and station type, the forecasted growth rate of each radio market (including long-term growth rate), and the discount rate.    This involved evaluating whether the\nassumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance in the market being evaluated, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were\nconsistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n utilized valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of valuation model used, evaluating\ncertain assumptions applied in the valuation model, and recalculations of the discounted cash flow schedules.  Realizability of\nDeferred Tax Assets  As disclosed in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2020, the Company had gross deferred\ntax assets on deductible temporary differences and carryforwards of $76.9 million reduced by a valuation allowance of $48.1 million. Deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of all available\nevidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks\nassociated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Such assessment involves a significant level of judgment and estimation, including\ncomplexity in the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the availability of carryforwards and estimates of projected future taxable income. The valuation allowance primarily related to federal and state net operating loss\ncarryforwards that are more likely than not to not be realized.  We considered auditing the realizability of deferred tax assets to be a critical audit\nmatter because it involved a high degree of subjectivity and audit effort in evaluating management’s estimates and judgments as well as \n  70 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ncomplexity in the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the availability of carryforwards and estimates of projected future taxable income due to uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic. Management’s judgments included assessing that all available positive and negative evidence and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies are analyzed to determine whether a\ndeferred tax asset or a portion thereof is “more likely than not” to be realized. Our audit of the realizability of deferred tax assets also included the assistance of tax specialists. \nOur audit procedures related to realizability of deferred tax assets included the following: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n evaluated management’s judgments over positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of\nrealization of deferred tax assets, which included cumulative losses in recent years, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, availability of carryforwards, industry wide declining revenue from reductions in advertising spend due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n evaluated management’s judgment of the uncertainty from the COVID-19\npandemic and its impact, based on current and forecasted industry and economic trends, on future earnings and verified the information used was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n utilized tax specialists to evaluate the application of jurisdictional tax laws and regulations used in the\nCompany’s assumptions and calculations and to test the completeness and accuracy of management’s scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, apportionment factors and the availability of carryforwards. \n/s/ Crowe LLP  We have served as the Company’s auditor\nsince 2016.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION  Description of\nBusiness  Salem Media Group, Inc. (“Salem” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “company”) is a domestic\nmultimedia company specializing in Christian and conservative content. Our media properties include radio broadcasting, digital media, and publishing entities. We have three operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and\n(3) Publishing, which are discussed in Note 20. Segment Data.  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Salem include the company and\nits wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic  In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. The responses by federal, state and local governments to restrict public gatherings and travel rapidly grew to include\nstay-at-home orders, school closures and mandatory restrictions on non-essential businesses and services that has adversely\naffected workforces, certain economies, and financial markets resulting in a significant economic downturn. We experienced declining revenue from advertising, programming, events and book sales. Several advertisers reduced or ceased advertising\nspend due to the outbreak and stay-at-home orders that effectively shut many businesses down. This was particularly true within our broadcast segment, which derives\nsubstantial revenue from local advertisers who have been particularly hard hit due to social distancing and government interventions and in our publishing segment that sells books in retail stores and through live events. \nWhile this disruption is expected to be temporary, there remains to be considerable uncertainty around the duration. Although advertising revenue continues to\nimprove from the lowest levels experienced during April and May of 2020, it remains significantly below prior years. The exact timing and pace of the recovery has not been determinable as certain markets have reopened, some of which have since\nexperienced a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, resulting in varying degrees of reinstated stay-at-home orders. Due to continuing\nuncertainties regarding the ultimate scope and trajectory of COVID-19’s spread and evolution, it is impossible to predict the total impact that the pandemic will have on our business. If public and\nprivate entities continue to enforce restrictive measures, the material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could persist. Our businesses could also continue to be impacted by the disruptions\nfrom COVID-19 and resulting adverse changes in advertising customers and consumer behavior.  Future availability\nunder our credit facility is contingent upon our eligible receivable balance, which is negatively impacted by lower revenue and longer days to collect. Availability under our Asset Based Loan (“ABL Facility”) is subject to a borrowing base\nconsisting of (a) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount based on the value of certain real property. The maximum amount available under our ABL Facility declined to $24.2 million at December 31, 2020\nfrom $26.4 million at December 31, 2019, of which $5.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2020 compared to $12.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019. \nIn response to these developments, beginning in March 2020, we implemented several measures to reduce costs and conserve cash to ensure that we have adequate\ncash to meet our debt servicing requirements, including:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n limiting capital expenditures; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n reducing discretionary spending, including travel and entertainment; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n eliminating open positions and freezing new hires; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n reducing staffing levels; \n  77 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n \n•\n \n implementing temporary company-wide pay cuts of 5%, 7.5% or 10% depending on salary level; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n furloughing certain employees; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n temporarily suspending the company 401(k) match; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n requesting rent concessions from landlords; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n requesting discounts from vendors; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n offering early payment discounts to certain customers in exchange for advance cash payments; and\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n suspending the payment of distributions on our common stock indefinitely. \nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act provides\nopportunities for additional liquidity, loan guarantees, and other government programs to support companies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and their employees. On December 27, 2020, Congress passed the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act (“CAA”) that includes a second relief package, which, among other things, provides for an extension of the Payroll Support Program established by the CARES Act. We have utilized certain benefits of the CARES\nAct, and we may be entitled to benefits under the CAA based on our individual locations, including:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n the deferral of all employer FICA taxes beginning in April 2020 for the remainder of 2020, with 50% payable in\nDecember 2021 and the remainder payable in December 2022;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n relaxation of interest expense deduction limitation for income tax purposes; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n Payroll Protection Plan (“PPP”) loans available based on the eligibility determined on a per-location basis of up to $11.2 million on a consolidated basis.  We believe that our customers\nhave benefited from the enhanced benefits provided by the CARES Act, and that they will also benefit from the CAA. The CAA provides for another round of direct payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, education funding, and aid to sectors still\nreeling from the economic fallout of the pandemic. While these measures may benefit many of our customers, we cannot assure you that the implementation of these measures will offset the negative impact of\nCOVID-19 on our customers. If the CAA or any additional stimulus measures are not sufficient to remediate the financial stress on our customers as a result of the pandemic, we may experience ongoing challenges\nin growing and maintain revenue and we may experience an increase in delinquencies that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods. \nWe continue to review and consider any available potential benefit under the CARES Act and the CAA for which we qualify. We cannot predict the manner in which\nsuch benefits or any of the other benefits described herein will be allocated or administered and we cannot assure you that we will be able to access such benefits in a timely manner or at all. If the U.S. government or any other governmental\nauthority agrees to provide such aid under the CARES Act, the CAA, or any other crisis relief assistance it may impose certain requirements on the recipients of the aid, including restrictions on executive officer compensation, dividends, prepayment\nof debt, limitations on debt and other similar restrictions that may apply for a period of time after the aid is repaid or redeemed in full.  Due to the\nadverse economic impact, we reforecast our anticipated results extending through March 2022. Our reforecast includes the impact of certain of these cost-cutting measures. Based on our current and expected economic outlook and our current and\nexpected funding needs, we believe that the borrowing capacity under our current credit facilities, together with cash on hand, allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund necessary capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service\nrequirements for at least the next twelve months, including the working capital deficit at December 31, 2020. Based on our current assessment, we believe that we have the ability to meet our obligations as they come due for one year from the\nissuance of this annual report. \n  78 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUse of Estimates \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Significant areas for which management uses estimates\ninclude:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n going concern evaluations; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n revenue recognition;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n asset impairments, including broadcasting licenses, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets;\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n probabilities associated with the potential for contingent earn-out\nconsideration;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n fair value measurements; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n contingency reserves;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n allowance for doubtful accounts; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n sales returns and allowances; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n barter transactions;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n inventory reserves;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n reserves for royalty advances; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n fair value of equity awards; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n self-insurance reserves; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n estimated lives for tangible and intangible assets; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n assessment of contract-based factors, asset-based factors, entity-based factors and market-based factors to\ndetermine the lease term impacting Right-Of-Use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n determining the Incremental Borrowing Rate (“IBR”) for calculating ROU assets and lease liabilities;\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n income tax valuation allowances; and \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n uncertain tax positions. \nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \nCash and Cash Equivalents  We consider all highly\nliquid debt instruments, purchased with an initial maturity of three-months or less, to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value at each balance sheet date. \nTrade Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenue \nTrade accounts receivable, net of allowances: Trade accounts receivable includes amounts billed and due from our customers stated at their net estimated\nrealizable value to be settled in cash. Trade accounts receivable for our self-publishing services represent contractual amounts due under individual payment plans that are adjusted quarterly to exclude unearned or cancellable contracts. \n  79 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUnbilled revenue: Unbilled revenue represents revenue recognized in excess of the amounts billed to\nour customer. Unbilled revenue results from differences in the Broadcast Calendar and the end of the reporting period. The Broadcast Calendar is a uniform billing period adopted by broadcasters, agencies and advertisers for billing and planning\nfunctions. The Broadcast Calendar uses a standard broadcast week that starts on Monday and ends on Sunday with month end on the last Sunday of the calendar month. We recognize revenue based on the calendar month end and adjust for unbilled revenue\nwhen the Broadcast Calendar billings are at an earlier date as applicable. We bill our customers at the end-of-flight, end of the Broadcast Calendar or at calendar month\nend, as applicable, with standard payments terms of thirty days.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts \nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that may not be collected. The allowance is based on our\nhistorical collection experience, the age of the receivables, specific customer information and current economic conditions. Past due balances are generally not written-off until all collection efforts have\nbeen exhausted, including use of a collection agency. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current creditworthiness of each customer. If the financial\ncondition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant\nlosses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected. We do not include extended payment terms in our contracts with customers. \nInventory  Inventories consist of published books\nrecorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value as determined on a First-In First-Out (“FIFO”) cost method. \nInventory Reserves  We record a provision to\nexpense the balance of unsold inventory that we believe to be unrecoverable. We review historical data associated with book inventories and our own experiences to estimate the fair value of inventory on hand. Our analysis includes a review of actual\nsales returns, our allowances, royalty reserves, overall economic conditions and product demand. We regularly monitor actual performance to our estimates and make adjustments as necessary. Estimated inventory reserves may be adjusted, either\nfavorably or unfavorably, if factors such as the historical data we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or as a result of changes in economic conditions of the customer and/or the market. We have not modified our\nestimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected. \nProperty and Equipment  We account for property\nand equipment in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360-10, “Property, Plant and Equipment.” Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost represents the\nhistorical cost of acquiring the asset, including the costs necessarily incurred to bring it to the condition and location necessary for its intended use. For assets constructed for our own use, such as towers and buildings that are discrete\nprojects for which costs are separately accumulated and for which construction takes considerable time, we record capitalized interest. The amount of interest capitalized is the cost that could have been avoided had the asset not been constructed\nand is based on the average accumulated expenditures incurred over the capitalization period at the weighted average interest rate applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt. We capitalized interest of $27,000 and $0.2 million during the\nyears ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Repair and  maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Improvements are capitalized if they extend\nthe life of the \n  80 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nasset or enhance the quality or ability of the asset to benefit operations. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Category\n  \n Estimated Life\n\n Buildings\n  \n40 years\n\n Office furnishings and equipment\n  \n5 -10 years\n\n Antennae, towers and transmitting equipment\n  \n10 -20 years\n\n Studio, production, and mobile equipment\n  \n5 - 7 years\n\n Computer software and website development costs\n  \n3 years\n\n Record and tape libraries\n  \n3 years\n\n Automobiles\n  \n5 years\n\n Leasehold improvements\n  \nLesser of the useful life orremaining lease term\n The carrying value of property and equipment is evaluated periodically in relation to the operating performance and\nanticipated future cash flows of the underlying radio stations and business units for indicators of impairment. When indicators of impairment are present, and the cash flows estimated to be generated from these assets is less than the carrying\nvalue, an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the fair market value of the assets is recorded. See Note 6, Property and Equipment. \nInternally Developed Software and Website Development Costs \nWe capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal-use\nsoftware as specified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350-40\n“Internal-Use Software.” Capitalized costs are generally depreciated over the estimated useful life of three years. Costs incurred related to the conceptual design and maintenance of internal-use software are expensed as incurred. Website development activities include planning, design and development of graphics and content for new websites and operation of existing sites. Costs incurred that\ninvolve providing additional functions and features to the website are capitalized. Costs associated with website planning, maintenance, content development and training are expensed as incurred. We capitalized $3.4 million and\n$2.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively, related to internally developed software and website development costs. Depreciation expense of the amounts capitalized was $2.8 million and\n$2.6 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  Broadcast Licenses \nWe account for broadcast licenses in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.” We do not amortize broadcast\nlicenses, but rather test for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the value may be impaired.  Impairment\ntesting requires an estimate of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. We believe that these estimates of fair value are critical accounting estimates as the value is significant in relation to our total assets and the estimates\nincorporate variables and assumptions based on our experiences and judgment about our future operating performance. Fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market\nparticipants would use in measuring fair value, including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and estimates used in our estimates, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which\nmay be material. The unobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” as Level 3 inputs discussed in detail in Note 13, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. \nWe perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year as discussed in Note 8, Broadcast Licenses. \n  81 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGoodwill \nWe account for goodwill in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.” We do not amortize goodwill, but rather\ntest for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.  Impairment testing requires an\nestimate of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. We believe that these estimates of fair value are critical accounting estimates as the value is significant in relation to our total assets and the estimates incorporate variables\nand assumptions based on our experiences and judgment about our future operating performance. Fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in\nmeasuring fair value, including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and estimates used in our estimates, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. The\nunobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” as Level 3 inputs discussed in detail in Note 13, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. \nWe perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year as discussed in Note 9, Goodwill. \nAmortizable Intangible Assets  Intangible assets\nare recorded at cost less accumulated amortization. Typically, intangible assets are acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of broadcast entities, digital media entities and publishing entities. These intangibles are amortized using the\nstraight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Category\n  \n Estimated Life\n\n Customer lists and contracts\n  \nLesser of 5 years or the life of contract\n\n Domain and brand names\n  \n5 -7 years\n\n Favorable and assigned leases\n  \nLease Term\n\n Subscriber base and lists\n  \n3 -7 years\n\n Author relationships\n  \n1-7 years\n\n Non-compete agreements\n  \n1 to 5 years\n The carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated periodically in relation to the operating performance\nand anticipated future cash flows of the underlying radio stations and businesses for indicators of impairment. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360 “Property, Plant and Equipment,” when indicators of impairment are present and the\nundiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated from these assets are less than the carrying amounts of these assets, an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the fair market value of these assets is recorded, if necessary. No adjustments to\nthe carrying amounts of our amortizable intangible assets were necessary during the year ended December 31, 2020.  Deferred Financing Costs\n Debt issue costs are amortized to non-cash interest expense over the term of the agreement using the\neffective interest method.  On May 19, 2017, we closed on a private offering of $255.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior\nsecured notes due 2024 (the “Notes”) and concurrently entered into a five-year $30.0 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, which includes a $5.0 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a\n$7.5 million subfacility for swingline loans due May 19, 2022.  We incurred debt issuance costs of $6.3 million that were recorded as a\nreduction of the Note proceeds that are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the life of the Notes using the effective interest method. We \n  82 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nincurred debt issue costs of $0.9 million that were recorded as an asset and are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the term of the ABL\nFacility using the effective interest method. See Note 12, Long-Term Debt.  Income Tax Valuation Allowances (Deferred Taxes) \nWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes.” In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we\nestimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement\npurposes. We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are\ngenerally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the tax implications are known. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. \nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available\nevidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation\nallowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a\ndetermination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. \nFor financial reporting purposes, we recorded a valuation allowance of $28.4 million as of December 31, 2020 to offset $28.4 million of the\ndeferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards of $15.7 million and other financial statement accrual assets of $4.0 million, for a total valuation allowance of $48.1 million for the year ended December 31,\n2020. This balance represents an increase of $35.1 million during the year, from $13.0 million valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019. \nWe believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected. \nIncome Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions  We are\nsubject to audit and review by various taxing jurisdictions. We may recognize liabilities on our financial statements for positions taken on uncertain tax positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be\nsustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others may be subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. Such positions are deemed to be unrecognized\ntax benefits and a corresponding liability is established on the balance sheet. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to make estimates based on the various possible outcomes. The benefit of a tax\nposition is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or\nlitigation processes, if any.  We review and reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Changes in assumptions may result in the recognition\nof a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions around our subsidiary Salem Communications Holding Company’s\nPennsylvania tax filing. The position taken on the tax returns follows Pennsylvania Notice 2016-01 which provides guidance for reversal of intercompany interest income and associated expense yielding a net\nloss for Pennsylvania. The current liability recognized for the tax position is $0.3 million including interest and penalties. Our evaluation was performed for all tax years that remain subject to examination, which range from 2017 through 2020\n\n  83 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEffective Tax Rate \nOur provision for income tax as a percentage of operating income before taxes, or our effective tax rate, may be impacted by: \n \n\n\n \n(1)\n changes in the level of income in any of our taxing jurisdictions; \n \n\n\n \n(2)\n changes in statutes and rules applicable to taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n  \n\n\n \n(3)\n changes in the expected outcome of income tax audits; \n \n\n\n \n(4)\n changes in the estimate of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes; \n \n\n\n \n(5)\n income taxes in certain states where the states’ current taxable income is dependent on factors other than\nconsolidated net income;   \n\n\n \n(6)\n the addition of operations in states that on average have different income tax rates from states in which we\ncurrently operate; and   \n\n\n \n(7)\n the effect of previously reported temporary differences between the and financial reporting bases of assets and\nliabilities.  Our annual effective tax rate may also be materially impacted by tax expense associated with non-amortizable assets such as broadcast licenses and goodwill as well as changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance. An impairment loss for financial statement purposes will result in an income tax benefit\nduring the period incurred as the amortization of broadcasting licenses and goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.  Business Acquisitions\n We account for business acquisitions in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting as specified in FASB ASC Topic 805 “Business\nCombinations.” The total acquisition consideration is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the transaction. The total acquisition consideration is equal to the sum of\nall cash payments, the fair value of any deferred payments and promissory notes, and the present value of any estimated contingent earn-out consideration. Transactions that do not meet the definition of a\nbusiness in ASU 2017-01 “Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business” are recorded as asset purchases. Asset purchases are recognized based on their cost to\nacquire, including transaction costs. The cost to acquire an asset group is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair value with no goodwill recognized. \nEstimates of the fair value include discounted estimated cash flows to be generated by the assets and their expected useful lives based on historical\nexperience, market trends and any synergies believed to be achieved from the acquisition. Acquisitions may include contingent consideration, the fair value of which is estimated as of the acquisition date as the present value of the expected\ncontingent payments as determined using weighted probabilities of the payment amounts. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in Note\n13, Fair Value Measurements.  We may retain a third-party appraiser to estimate the fair value of the acquired net assets as of the acquisition date. As\npart of the valuation and appraisal process, the third-party appraiser prepares a report assigning estimated fair values to the various assets acquired. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and require careful consideration and\njudgment. Management reviews the third-party reports for reasonableness of the assigned values. We believe that these valuations and analysis provide appropriate estimates of the fair value for the net assets acquired as of the acquisition date.\n The initial valuations for business acquisitions are subject to refinement during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the\nacquisition date. During this measurement period, we may retroactively record adjustments to the net assets acquired based on additional information obtained for items that existed as of the \n  84 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nacquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any adjustments are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. To date, we have not recorded adjustments to the\nestimated fair values used in our business acquisition consideration during or after the measurement period.  Property and equipment are recorded at the\nestimated fair value and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Finite-lived intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nGoodwill, which represents the organizational systems and procedures in place to ensure the effective operation of the entity, may also be recorded and tested for impairment. \nCosts associated with business acquisitions, such as consulting and legal fees, are expensed as incurred. We did not incur acquisition related costs during\nthe year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0.1 million of acquisition related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019, which are included in unallocated corporate expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements\nof Operations.  Partial Self-Insurance on Employee Health Plan \nWe provide health insurance benefits to eligible employees under a self-insured plan whereby we pay actual medical claims subject to certain stop loss limits.\nWe record self-insurance liabilities based on actual claims filed and an estimate of those claims incurred but not reported. Our estimates are based on historical data and probabilities. Any projection of losses concerning our liability is subject\nto a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors such as future inflation rates, changes in severity, benefit level changes, medical costs and claim settlement patterns. Should the actual\namount of claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated, we may adjust our future reserves. Our self-insurance liability was $0.5 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We have not modified our\nestimate methodology and we have not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates.  The following table presents the changes\nin our partial self-insurance reserves:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n    2019    \n \n  \n    2020      \n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Balance, beginning of period\n  \n$\n828\n \n  \n$\n640\n \n\n Self-funded costs\n  \n \n8,087\n \n  \n \n7,477\n \n\n Claims paid\n  \n \n(8,275\n) \n  \n \n(7,574\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Ending period balance\n  \n$\n640\n \n  \n$\n543\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n Derivative Instruments \nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. We actively monitor these fluctuations and may use derivative instruments primarily for the\npurpose of reducing the impact of changing interest rates on our variable rate debt and to reduce the impact of changing fair market values on our fixed rate debt. In accordance with our risk management strategy, we may use derivative instruments\nonly for the purpose of managing risk associated with an asset, liability, committed transaction, or probable forecasted transaction that is identified by management. Our use of derivative instruments may result in short-term gains or losses that\nmay increase the volatility of our earnings.  Under FASB ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” the effective portion of the gain or\nloss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument shall be reported as a component of other comprehensive income (outside earnings) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which\nthe hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, shall be recognized currently in earnings. \n  85 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any outstanding derivative instruments. \nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures  As of\nDecember 31, 2020, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued interest approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of such instruments. The carrying value\nof the ABL Facility approximates fair value as the related interest rates approximate rates currently available to the company. The carrying amount of the Notes at December 31, 2020 was $216.3 million, compared to the estimated fair value\nof $199.0 million based on the prevailing interest rates and trading activity of our Notes. See Note 13, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. \nLong-term Debt and Debt Covenant Compliance  Our\nclassification of outstanding borrowings on our Notes as long-term debt on our balance sheet is based on our assessment that, under the Indenture and after considering our projected operating results and cash flows for the coming year, no principal\npayments are required to be made within the next twelve months. The Notes have a term of seven years, maturing on June 1, 2024. We may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal\namount to be redeemed) set forth in the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. See Note 12, Long-Term Debt. \nReserves for Royalty Advances  Royalties due to\nbook authors are paid in advance and capitalized. Royalties are expensed as the related book revenue is earned or when we determine that future recovery of the royalty is not likely. We reviewed historical data associated with royalty advances,\nearnings and recoverability based on actual results of Regnery® Publishing. Historically, the longer the unearned portion of an advance remains outstanding, the less likely it is that we will\nrecover the advance through the sale of the book. We apply this historical experience to outstanding royalty advances to estimate the likelihood of recovery. A provision was established to expense the balance of any unearned advance which we believe\nis not recoverable. Our analysis also considers other discrete factors, such as death of an author, any decision to not pursue publication of a title, poor market demand or other relevant factors. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we\nhave not historically recognized significant losses from changes in our estimates. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected. \nContingency Reserves  In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, we are involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits, arbitration and other claims which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of\nmonetary liability or the financial impact with respect to these matters.  We record contingency reserves to the extent we conclude that it is probable\nthat a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. The establishment of the reserve is based on a review of all relevant factors, the advice of legal counsel, and the subjective judgment of management.\nThe reserves we have recorded to date have not been material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and that our reserves are accurately reflected.\n While we believe that the final resolution of any known matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect upon our\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, it is possible that we could incur additional losses. We maintain insurance that may provide coverage for such matters. Future claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could\nhave a material adverse effect upon our \n  86 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including losses due to costly litigation and losses due to matters that require significant amounts of management time that\ncan result in the diversion of significant operational resources. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies.  Revenue Recognition \nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”). ASC 606 is a\ncomprehensive revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers at an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive. \nSignificant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determining the amount of revenue to be recognized in any accounting period.\nApplication of ASC 606 requires a five-step model as discussed in Note 4, Revenue Recognition.  Stock-Based Compensation \nWe account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation.” We record equity\nawards with stock-based compensation measured at the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We determine the fair value of our options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that requires the input of highly subjective assumptions,\nincluding the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted. The exercise price for options is equal to the closing market price of Salem Media Group common stock as of the date of grant. We use the straight-line\nattribution method to recognize share-based compensation costs over the expected service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock awards, deferred\ntax assets for options and restricted stock awards with multiple vesting dates are eliminated for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting\nperiod was a separate award. See Note 16, Stock Incentive Plan.  Advertising and Promotional Cost \nCosts of media advertising and associated production costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to approximately $7.9 million and $9.2 million for\neach of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.  Leases \nWe adopted ASC 842 “Leases,” on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective basis and electing the package of practical expedients\nprovided by FASB. ASC 842 requires that lessees recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities calculated based on the present value of lease payments for all lease agreements with terms that are greater than twelve months. ASC 842 distinguishes leases\nas either a finance lease or an operating lease that affects how the leases are measured and presented in the statement of operations and statement of cash flows. \nFor operating leases, we calculated ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of the remaining lease payments as of the date of adoption\nusing the IBR as of that date. There were no changes in our capital lease portfolio, which are now titled “finance leases” under ASC 842, other than the reclassification of the assets acquired under capital leases from their respective\nproperty and equipment category and long-term debt to ROU assets and lease liabilities.  Accounting Policy Elections under ASC 842 \nLease Term  We calculate\nthe term for each lease agreement to include the noncancellable period specified in the agreement together with (1) the periods covered by options to extend the lease if we are reasonably certain\n\n  87 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nto exercise that option, (2) periods covered by an option to terminate if we are reasonably certain not to exercise that option and (3) period covered by an option to extend (or not\nterminate) if controlled by the lessor.  The assessment of whether we are reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease requires significant\njudgement surrounding contract-based factors, asset-based factors, entity-based factors and market-based factors. These factors are described in our Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates in Item 7 in this annual report. \nLease Payments  Lease\npayments consist of the following payments (as applicable) related to the use of the underlying asset during the lease term:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Fixed payments, including in substance fixed payments, less any lease incentives paid or payable to the lessee\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, such as the Consumer Price Index or a market interest\nrate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date of January 1, 2019.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n The exercise price of an option to purchase the underlying asset if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise\nthat option.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Payments for penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to\nterminate the lease.   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Fees paid by the lessee to the owners of a special-purpose entity for structuring the transaction\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n For a lessee only, amounts probable of being owed by the lessee under residual value guarantees\n Short-Term Lease Exemption \nWe exclude short-term leases, or leases with a term of twelve months or less that do not contain a purchase option that we are reasonably\ncertain to exercise, from our ROU asset and lease liability calculations.  We considered the applicability of the short-term exception on month-to-month leases with perpetual or rolling renewals as we are “reasonably certain” to continue the lease. For example, we lease various storage facilities under\nagreements with month-to-month terms that have continued over several years. The standard terms and conditions for a majority of these agreements allow either party to\nterminate within a notice period ranging from 10 to 30 days. There are no cancellation penalties other than the potential loss of a one-month rent or a security deposit if the termination terms are not adhered\nto.  We believe that these month-to-month leases qualify for the\nshort-term exception to ASC 842 because either party can terminate the agreement without permission from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty, therefore, the arrangements do not create enforceable rights and obligations.\nAdditionally, the cost to move to a new location or find comparable facilities is low as there are no unique features of the storage facilities that impact our business or operations. We considered termination clauses, costs associated with moving\nand costs associated with finding alternative facilities to exclude month-to-month leases that have perpetually renewed. \nService Agreements with an Embedded Lease Component \nWe exclude certain service agreements that contain embedded leases for equipment based on the immaterial impact of these agreements. Our\nanalysis included cable and satellite television service agreements for which our monthly payment may include equipment rentals, coffee and water service at certain facilities that \n  88 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nmay include equipment rentals (we often meet minimum requirements and just pay for product used), security services that include a monthly fee for cameras or equipment, and other similar\narrangements. Based on the insignificant amount of the monthly lease costs, we exclude these agreements from our ROU asset and liability calculations due to the immaterial impact to our financial statements. \nIncremental Borrowing Rate \nThe ROU asset and related lease liabilities recorded under ASC 842 are calculated based on the present value of the lease payments using\n(1) the rate implicit in the lease or (2) the lessee’s IBR, defined as the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar\neconomic environment. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we estimate the IBR applicable to Salem using significant judgement and estimates, including the estimated value of the underlying leased asset, and the (a) credit history of\nSalem Media Group, (b) the credit worthiness of Salem Media Group, (c) the class of the underlying asset and the remaining term of the arrangement, and (d) the debt incurred under the lease liability as compared to amounts that would\nbe borrowed.  From these data points, we develop a matrix to estimate the IBR for each lease class. We review the IBR estimates on a quarterly basis and\nupdate as necessary. We have not modified our estimate methodology and we have not recognized significant changes in our estimates.  Our analysis required\nthe use of significant judgement and estimates, including the estimated value of the underlying leased asset, as described in are described in our Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates in Item 7 in this annual report. \nPortfolio Approach  We\napply a portfolio approach by applying a single IBR to leases with reasonably similar characteristics, including the remaining lease term, the underlying assets and the economic environment. We believe that applying the portfolio approach is\nacceptable because the results do not materially differ from the application of the leases model to the individual leases in that portfolio. \nSales Taxes and Other Similar Taxes \nWe do not evaluate whether sales taxes or other similar taxes imposed by a governmental authority on a specific lease revenue-producing\ntransaction that are collected by the lessor from the lessee are the primary obligation of the lessor as owner of the underlying leased asset. A lessor that makes this election will exclude these taxes from the measurement of lease revenue and the\nassociated expense. Taxes assessed on a lessor’s total gross receipts or on the lessor as owner of the underlying asset (e.g., property taxes) are excluded from the scope of the policy election. A lessor must apply the election to all taxes in\nthe scope of the policy election and would provide certain disclosures.  Separating Consideration between Lease and Non-Lease Components  We include the lease and non-lease\ncomponents (or the fixed and variable consideration) as a single component accounted for as a lease. This practical expedient is elected by class of underlying assets as an accounting policy election and applies to all arrangements in that class of\nunderlying assets that qualify for the expedient. ASC 842 provides this expedient to alleviate concerns that the costs and administrative burden of allocating consideration to the separate lease and non-lease\ncomponents may not justify the benefit of more precisely reflecting the ROU asset and the lease liability. \n  89 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nContracts that include lease and non-lease components that are\naccounted for under the election not to separate require that all components that qualify for the practical expedient be combined. The components that do not qualify, such as those for which the timing and pattern of transfer of the lease and\nassociated non-lease components are not the same, are accounted for separately.  Accounting for a lease component\nof a contract and its associated non-lease components as a single lease component results in an allocation of the total contract consideration to the lease component. Therefore, the initial and subsequent\nmeasurement of the lease liability and ROU asset is greater than if the policy election was not applied. The greater ROU asset value is considered in our impairment analysis. \nImpairment of ROU Assets  ROU assets are reviewed\nfor impairment when indicators of impairment are present. ROU assets from operating and finance leases are subject to the impairment guidance in ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment,” as ROU assets are long-lived nonfinancial\nassets.  ROU assets are tested for impairment individually or as part of an asset group if the cash flows related to the ROU asset are not independent\nfrom the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An asset group is the unit of accounting for long-lived assets to be held and used, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of\nother groups of assets and liabilities.  After a careful analysis of the guidance, we concluded that the appropriate unit of accounting for testing ROU\nassets for impairment is the broadcast market cluster level for radio station operations and the entity or division level for digital media entities, publishing entities and networks. Corporate ROU assets are tested on a consolidated level with\nconsideration given to all cash flows of the company as corporate functions do not generate cash flows and are funded by revenue-producing activities at lower levels of the entity. \nASC 360 requires three steps to identify, recognize and measure the impairment of a long-lived asset (asset group) to be held and used: \nStep 1—Consider whether Indicators of Impairment are Present \nAs detailed in ASC\n360-10-35-21, the following are examples of impairment indicators: \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n A significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset (asset group) \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or\nin its physical condition   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a\nlong-lived asset (asset group), including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator   \n\n\n \n•\n \n An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or\nconstruction of a long-lived asset (asset group)   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a\nprojection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset (asset group)   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise\ndisposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The term more likely than not refers to a level of likelihood that is more than 50 percent. \nOther indicators should be considered if we believe that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. \n  90 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nStep 2—Test for Recoverability \nIf indicators of impairment are present, we are required to perform a recoverability test comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash\nflows attributable to the long-lived asset or asset group in question to the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group.  ASC\n360 does not specifically address how operating lease liabilities and future cash outflows for lease payments should be considered in the recoverability test. Under ASC 360, financial liabilities, or long-term debt, generally are excluded from an\nasset group while operating liabilities, such as accounts payable, generally are included. ASC 842 characterizes operating lease liabilities as operating liabilities. Because operating lease liabilities may be viewed as having attributes of finance\nliabilities as well as operating liabilities, it is generally acceptable for a lessee to either include or exclude operating lease liabilities from an asset group when testing whether the carrying amount of an asset group is recoverable provided the\napproach is applied consistently for all operating leases and when performing Steps 2 and 3 of the impairment model in ASC 360.  In cases\nwhere we have received lease incentives, including operating lease liabilities in an asset group may result in the long-lived asset or asset group having a zero or negative carrying amount because the incentives reduce our ROU assets. We elected to\nexclude operating lease liabilities from the carrying amount of the asset group such that we test ROU assets for operating leases in the same manner that we test ROU assets for financing leases. \nUndiscounted Future Cash Flows \nThe undiscounted future cash flows in Step 2 are based on our own assumptions rather than a market participant. If an election is made to\nexclude operating lease liabilities from the asset or asset group, all future cash lease payments for the lease should also be excluded. The standard requires lessees to exclude certain variable lease payments from lease payments and, therefore,\nfrom the measurement of a lessee’s lease liabilities. Because these variable payments do not reduce the lease liability, we include the variable payments we expect to make in our estimate of the undiscounted cash flows in the recoverability\ntest (Step 2) using a probability-weighted approach.  Step 3—Measurement of an Impairment Loss \nIf the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset (asset group), we are\nrequired to estimate the fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group and recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value. We elected to exclude operating lease\nliabilities from the estimated fair value, consistent with the recoverability test. Any impairment loss for an asset group must reduce only the carrying amounts of a long-lived asset or assets of the group, including the ROU assets. The loss must be\nallocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group must not reduce the carrying amount of that asset\nbelow its fair value whenever the fair value is determinable without undue cost and effort. ASC 360 prohibits the subsequent reversal of an impairment loss for an asset held and used. \nFair Value Considerations \nWhen determining the fair value of a ROU asset, we must estimate what market participants would pay to lease the asset or what a market\nparticipant would pay up front in one payment for the ROU asset, assuming no additional lease payments would be due. The ROU asset must be valued assuming its highest and best use, in its current form, even if that use differs from the current or\nintended use. If no market exists for an asset in its current form, but there is a market for a transformed asset, the costs to transform the asset are considered in the fair value estimate. Refer to Note 13, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\n\n  91 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThere were no indications of impairment during the year ended December 31, 2020. \nLeasehold Improvements  We may construct or\notherwise invest in leasehold improvements to properties. The costs of these leasehold improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the lease term including anticipated renewal\nperiods.  (Gain) Loss on the Disposition of Assets \nWe record gains or losses on the disposition of assets equal to the proceeds, if any, as compared to the net book value. Exchange transactions are accounted\nfor in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 845 “Non-Monetary Transactions.”  During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, we recorded a $1.4 million estimated pre-tax loss for associated with plans to exit the Miami broadcast market with the pending sale of radio station\nWKAT-AM and various other fixed asset disposals.  During the year ended December 31, 2019 we recorded a\n$9.4 million pre-tax loss for the sale of nine radio stations, WAFS-AM in Atlanta, Georgia, WWDJ-AM in Boston,\nMassachusetts, WHKZ-AM in Cleveland, Ohio, KEXB-AM (formerly KTNO-AM) in Dallas, Texas,\nKDMT-AM in Denver, Colorado, KTEK-AM in Houston, Texas, KRDY-AM in San Antonio, Texas and\nKXFN-AM and WSDZ-AM in St. Louis, Missouri, a $4.7 million pre-tax loss from the sale of four radio stations, WWMI-AM and WLCC-AM in Tampa, Florida and WZAB-AM and WOCN-AM (formerly WKAT-AM) in Miami, Florida, a $3.8 million pre-tax loss on the sale of radio station WSPZ-AM in Washington, D.C., a\n$1.6 million pre-tax loss from the sale of radio station WDYZ-AM (formerly WORL-AM) in Orlando, Florida, a $1.3 million\npre-tax loss on the exchange of radio station KKOL-AM in Seattle, Washington for KPAM-AM in Portland, Oregon, a $0.2 million\npre-tax loss on the sale Mike Turner’s line of investment products, a $0.2 million pre-tax loss on the sale of HumanEvents.com and a $1.5 million\nestimated pre-tax loss for the pending sale of radio station WBZW-AM in Orlando, Florida that was partially offset by a $0.4 million\npre-tax gain on the sale of a portion of land on our transmitter site in Miami, Florida and a $0.1 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Newport Natural Health. \nDiscontinued Operations  We regularly review\nunderperforming assets to determine if a sale or disposal might be a better way to monetize the assets. When a station, group of stations, or other asset group is considered for sale or disposal, we review the transaction to determine if or when the\nentity qualifies as a discontinued operation in accordance with the criteria of FASB ASC Topic 205-20 “Discontinued Operations.” \nBasic and Diluted Net Earnings Per Share  Basic\nnet earnings per share has been computed using the weighted average number of Class A and Class B shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares\nof Class A and Class B common stock outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effects of stock options.  Options to purchase 2,291,020 and\n1,860,722 shares of Class A common stock were outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding exclude outstanding stock options whose exercise price is in excess of the average price of the\ncompany’s stock price. These options are excluded from the respective computations of diluted net income or loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. \n  92 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe following table sets forth the shares used to compute basic and diluted net earnings per share for the\nperiods indicated:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n2019\n \n  \n2020\n \n\n Weighted average shares\n  \n \n26,502,934\n \n  \n \n26,683,363\n \n\n Effect of dilutive securities—stock options\n  \n \n—  \n \n  \n \n—  \n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Weighted average shares adjusted for dilutive securities\n  \n \n26,502,934\n \n  \n \n26,683,363\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n Segments  We have\nthree operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating segments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of\nsenior executives, assesses the performance of each operating segment and determines the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We continually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our\nbusiness and may make changes as necessary.  We measure and evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that do not\ninclude allocations of costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury, which are reported as unallocated corporate expenses in our consolidated statements of operations included in this\nannual report. We also exclude costs such as amortization, depreciation, taxes and interest expense.  Variable Interest Entities \nWe may enter into agreements or investments with other entities that could qualify as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in accordance with FASB ASC\nTopic 810 “Consolidation” (“ASC 810.”) A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial\ninterests in the VIE, either explicitly or implicitly. A VIE is an entity for which the primary beneficiary’s interest in the entity can change with variations in factors other than the amount of investment in the entity. We perform our\nevaluation for VIE’s upon entry into the agreement or investment. We re-evaluate the VIE when or if events occur that could change the status of the VIE. \nWe may enter into lease arrangements with entities controlled by our principal stockholders or other related parties. We believe that the requirements of FASB\nASC 810 do not apply to these entities because the lease arrangements do not contain explicit guarantees of the residual value of the real estate, do not contain purchase options or similar provisions and the leases are at terms that do not vary\nmaterially from leases that would have been available with unaffiliated parties. Additionally, we do not have an equity interest in the entities controlled by our principal stockholders or other related parties and we do not guarantee debt of the\nentities controlled by our principal stockholders or other related parties.  We also enter into Local Marketing Agreements (“LMAs”) or Time\nBrokerage Agreements (“TBAs”) contemporaneously with entering into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) to acquire or sell a radio station. Typically, both LMAs and TBAs are contractual agreements under which the station\nowner/licensee makes airtime available to a programmer/licensee in exchange for a fee and reimbursement of certain expenses. LMAs and TBAs are subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and the communications laws, including the requirement that\nthe licensee must maintain independent control over the station and, in particular, its personnel, programming, and finances. The FCC has held that such agreements do not violate the communications laws as long as the licensee of the station\nreceiving programming from another station maintains ultimate responsibility for, and control over, station operations and otherwise ensures compliance with the communications laws. \n  93 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe requirements of FASB ASC 810 may apply to entities under LMAs or TBAs, depending on the facts and\ncircumstances related to each transaction. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have implicit or explicit arrangements that required consolidation under the guidance in FASB ASC 810. \nConcentrations of Business Risks  We derive a\nsubstantial part of our total revenue from the sale of advertising. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 30.7% and 35.3%, respectively, of our total broadcast revenue was generated from the sale of broadcast advertising. We are\nparticularly dependent on revenue from stations in the Los Angeles and Dallas markets, which generated 14.1% and 22.1% of the total broadcast advertising revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 15.0% and 20.4% of the total broadcast\nadvertising revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. Because substantial portions of our revenue is derived from local advertisers in these key markets, our ability to generate revenue in those markets could be adversely affected by local\nor regional economic downturns.  Concentrations of Credit Risks \nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents; trade accounts receivable and\nderivative instruments. We place our cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions. Such balances may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. To manage the related credit exposure, we\ncontinually monitor the credit worthiness of the financial institutions where we have deposits. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets in which we provide\nservices, as well as the dispersion of our operations across many geographic areas. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, but generally do not require collateral to support customer receivables. We establish an allowance for\ndoubtful accounts based on various factors including the credit risk of specific customers, age of receivables outstanding, historical trends, economic conditions and other information. Historically, our bad debt expense has been within\nmanagement’s expectations.  These estimates require the use of judgment as future events and the effect of these events cannot be predicted with\ncertainty. The estimates will change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired and as more information is obtained. We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and we may consult outside experts to assist as\nconsidered necessary.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements \nChanges to accounting principles are established by the FASB in the form of ASUs to the FASB’s Codification. We consider the applicability and impact of\nall ASUs on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof. Described below are ASUs that are not yet effective, but may be applicable to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation\nthereof. ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to not be applicable to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof. \nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope, which refines the scope\nof ASC 848, Reference Rate Reform, and clarifies guidance as part of the FASB’s ongoing monitoring of global reference rate reform activities. The ASU permits entities to elect certain optional expedients and exceptions when accounting\nfor derivative contracts and certain hedging relationships affected by changes in the interest rates used for discounting cash flows, computing variation margin settlements, and calculating price alignment interest in connection with reference rate\nreform activities under way in global financial markets. The ASU is effective upon issuance and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof. \n  94 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01,\nInvestments—Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)—Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815. The ASU is\nbased on a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force and is expected to increase comparability in accounting for these transactions. ASU 2016-01 made targeted improvements to accounting for financial\ninstruments, including providing an entity the ability to measure certain equity securities without a readily determinable fair value at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Among other topics, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting. The ASU\nis effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows,\nor presentation thereof.  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses,\nwhich changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and\nother instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking “expected loss” model that will replace today’s “incurred loss” model and generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses.\nFor available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to current practice, except that the losses will\nbe recognized as an allowance. Subsequent to issuing ASU 2016-13, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial\nInstruments—Credit Losses, for the purpose of clarifying certain aspects of ASU 2016-13. ASU 2018-19 has the same effective date and transition requirements as\nASU 2016-13. In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives\nand Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which is effective with the adoption of ASU 2016-13. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial\nInstruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), which is also effective with the adoption of ASU 2016-13. In October 2019, the FASB voted to delay the implementation date for certain companies, including\nthose, such as Salem, that qualify as a smaller reporting company under SEC rules, until January 1, 2023. We will adopt this ASU on its effective date of January 1, 2023. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact\non our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof.  NOTE 3. RECENT TRANSACTIONS \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed or entered into the following transactions: \nDebt Transactions  On April 7, 2020, we amended the\nAsset Based Loan Facility to increase the advance rate on eligible accounts receivable from 85% to 90% and to extend the maturity date from May 19, 2022 to March 1, 2024. The April 7, 2020 amendment allows for an alternative benchmark\nrate that may include SOFR due to LIBOR being scheduled to be discontinued at the end of calendar year 2021.  We completed repurchases of\n$3.5 million of the 6.75% Senior Secured Notes (“Notes”) for $3.4 million in cash, recognizing a net gain of $49,000 after adjusting for bond issuance costs as detailed in Note 12 – Long-Term Debt. \nEquity Transactions  Distributions of $0.7 million\n($0.025 per share) were declared and paid in March 2020 based upon our Board of Directors’ (“Board”) then current assessment of our business as detailed in Note 19 – Equity Transactions. \n  95 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAcquisitions \nOn September 15, 2020, we acquired the Hyper Pixels Media website and related assets for $1.1 million in cash. We paid $0.4 million in cash upon\nclosing with deferred payments of $0.4 million due January 31, 2021 and $0.3 million due September 15, 2021. We recorded goodwill of approximately $0.1 million associated with the expected synergies to be realized upon\ncombining the operations of Journeyboxmedia.com into our digital media platform within Salem Web Network (“SWN”) and from brand loyalty from its existing subscriber base that is not a separately identifiable intangible asset. The\naccompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations reflects the operating results of this entity as of the closing date within our digital media segment. \nA summary of our business acquisitions and asset purchases during the year ended December 31, 2020, none of which were individually or in the aggregate\nmaterial to our Consolidated financial position as of the respective date of acquisition, is as follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Acquisition Date\n  \n Description\n \nTotal Cost\n \n\n \n  \n \n \n(Dollars inthousands)\n \n\n September 15, 2020\n  \nHyper Pixels (business acquisition)\n \n$\n1,108\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n  \n  \n \n\n\n  \n\n \n$\n1,108\n \n\n\n  \n\n \n  \n  \n \n Under the acquisition method of accounting as specified in FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, the total\nacquisition consideration of a business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the transaction. Transactions that do not meet the definition of a business in ASU 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business are recorded as asset purchases. Asset purchases are recognized based on their cost to acquire, including transaction costs.\nThe cost to acquire an asset group is allocated to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair value with no goodwill recognized.  Fair\nvalue estimates include the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their expected useful lives based on historical experience, market trends and the impact of any synergies believed to be achieved from the acquisition.\nAcquisitions may include contingent consideration, the fair value of which is estimated as of the acquisition date as the present value of the expected contingent payments as determined using weighted probabilities of the payment amounts. \nWe may retain a third-party appraiser to estimate the fair value of the net assets acquired as of the acquisition date. As part of this valuation and\nappraisal process, the third-party appraiser prepares a report assigning estimated fair values to the various assets acquired. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and require careful consideration and judgment. Management reviews the\nthird-party reports for reasonableness of the assigned values. We believe that these valuations and analysis provide appropriate estimates of the fair value for the net assets acquired as of the acquisition date. \nThe initial valuations for business acquisitions are subject to refinement during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition\ndate. During this measurement period, we may record adjustments to the net assets acquired based on additional information obtained for items that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any adjustments are\nreflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. To date, we have not recorded adjustments to the estimated fair values used in our business acquisition consideration during or after the measurement period. \nProperty and equipment are recorded at the estimated fair value and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Finite-lived\nintangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill, which represents the organizational systems and procedures in place to ensure the effective operation of\nthe entity, may also be recorded and tested for impairment. Costs associated with business acquisitions, such as consulting and legal fees, are expensed as incurred. \n  96 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe following table summarizes the total acquisition consideration for the year ended December 31,\n2020:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n  \nTotal Consideration\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Cash payments made upon closing\n  \n$\n400\n \n\n Deferred payments\n  \n \n700\n \n\n Closing costs accrued for business acquisitions\n  \n \n8\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Total purchase price consideration\n  \n$\n1,108\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n The fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nNet Digital MediaAssets Acquired\n \n\n Assets\n  \n\n\n\n\n Property and equipment\n  \n$\n866\n \n\n Goodwill\n  \n \n66\n \n\n Customer lists and contracts\n  \n \n179\n \n\n Domain and brand names\n  \n \n18\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n\n  \n$\n1,129\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Liabilities\n  \n\n\n\n\n Contract liabilities\n  \n$\n(21\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n\n  \n$\n1,108\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n Divestitures  On\nApril 6, 2020, we sold radio station WBZW-AM and an FM translator construction permit in Orlando, Florida, for $0.2 million in cash. We recognized an estimated\npre-tax loss of approximately $1.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2019, which reflects the sale price as compared to the carrying value of the assets less the estimated closing\ncosts.  Pending Transactions  On September 10,\n2020, we entered an APA to sell radio station WKAT-AM and an FM translator in Miami, Florida, for $3.5 million in cash. We will exit the Miami market upon the close of this transaction. We entered a Local\nMarketing Agreement (“LMA”) under which the buyer will begin programming the station in November 2020. We recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $1.4 million during the three-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2020, which reflects the sale price as compared to the carrying value of the assets sold, the estimated closing costs, and the write-off of the remaining Miami assets as a result of exiting\nthis market. This transaction is subject to the approval of the FCC and is expected to close in the first half of 2021.  On February 5, 2020, we\nentered an APA with Word Broadcasting to sell radio stations WFIA-AM, WFIA-FM and WGTK-AM in Louisville, Kentucky for\n$4.0 million with credits applied from amounts previously paid, including a portion of the monthly fees paid under a Time Brokerage Agreement (“TBA.”) Due to changes in debt markets, the transaction was not funded, and it is uncertain\nwhen, or if, the transaction will close. Word Broadcasting continues to program the stations under a TBA that began in January 2017.  NOTE 4. REVENUE\nRECOGNITION  We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”). ASC 606\nrequires revenue to be recognized when control of the promised goods or services transfers to our \n  97 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ncustomers at an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive. The application of ASC 606 requires us to use significant judgment and estimates when applying a five-step model\napplicable to all revenue streams.  Principal versus Agent Considerations \nWhen another party is involved in providing goods or services to our customer, we apply the principal versus agent guidance in ASC 606 to determine if we are\nthe principal or an agent to the transaction. When we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to our customer, we report revenue gross, as principal. If we do not control the goods or services before they are transferred\nto our customer, revenue is reported net of the fees paid to the other party, as agent.  Contract Assets \nContract Assets—Costs to Obtain a Contract: We capitalize commissions paid to sales personnel in our self-publishing business when customer\ncontracts are signed and advance payment is received. These capitalized costs are recorded as prepaid commission expense in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount capitalized is incremental to the contract and would not have been incurred\nabsent the execution of the customer contract. Commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a contract are expensed at the point in time that related revenue is recognized. Prepaid commission expenses are periodically reviewed for impairment. At\nDecember 31, 2020, our prepaid commission expense was $0.7 million.  Contract Liabilities \nContract liabilities consist of customer advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. We may receive payments from our customers in advance\nof completing our performance obligations. Additionally, new customers, existing customers without approved credit terms and authors purchasing specific self-publishing services, are required to make payments in advance of the delivery of the\nproducts or performance of the services. We record contract liabilities equal to the amount of payments received in excess of revenue recognized, including payments that are refundable if the customer cancels the contract according to the contract\nterms. Contract liabilities were historically recorded under the caption “deferred revenue” and are reported as current liabilities on our consolidated financial statements when the time to fulfill the performance obligations under terms\nof our contracts is less than one year. Long-term contract liabilities represent the amount of payments received in excess of revenue earned, including those that are refundable, when the time to fulfill the performance obligation is greater than\none year. Our long-term liabilities consist of subscriptions with a term of two-years for which some customers have purchased and paid for multiple years. \nSignificant changes in our contract liabilities balances during the period are as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nShort Term\n \n  \nLong-Term\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Balance, beginning of period January 1, 2020\n  \n$\n9,493\n \n  \n$\n1,744\n \n\n Revenue recognized during the period that was included in the beginning balance of contract\nliabilities\n  \n \n(7,096\n) \n  \n \n—\n \n\n Additional amounts recognized during the period\n  \n \n23,727\n \n  \n \n878\n \n\n Revenue recognized during the period that was recorded during the period\n  \n \n(15,225\n) \n  \n \n—\n \n\n Transfers\n  \n \n753\n \n  \n \n(753\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Balance, end of period December 31, 2020\n  \n$\n11,652\n \n  \n \n1,869\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Amount refundable at beginning of period\n  \n$\n9,403\n \n  \n$\n1,744\n \n\n Amount refundable at end of period\n  \n$\n11,607\n \n  \n \n1,869\n \n\n  98 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe expect to satisfy these performance obligations as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nAmount\n \n\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n 2021\n  \n$\n11,652\n \n\n 2022\n  \n \n1,257\n \n\n 2023\n  \n \n328\n \n\n 2024\n  \n \n155\n \n\n 2025\n  \n \n46\n \n\n Thereafter\n  \n \n83\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n \n  \n$13,521\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n Significant Financing Component \nThe length of our typical sales agreement is less than 12 months; however, we may sell subscriptions with a two-year\nterm. The balance of our long-term contract liabilities represents the unsatisfied performance obligations for subscriptions with a remaining term in excess of one year. We review long-term contract liabilities that are expected to be completed in\nexcess of one year to assess whether the contract contains a significant financing component. The balance includes subscriptions that will be satisfied at various dates between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2025. The difference between\nthe promised consideration and the cash selling price of the publications is not significant. Therefore, we have concluded that subscriptions do not contain a significant financing component under ASC 606. \nOur self-publishing contracts may exceed a one-year term due to the length of time for an author to submit and approve\na manuscript for publication. The author may pay for publishing services in installments over the production timeline with payments due in advance of performance. The timing of the transfer of goods and services under self-publishing arrangements\nare at the discretion of the author and based on future events that are not substantially within our control. We require advance payments to provide us with protection from incurring costs for products that are unique and only sellable to the\nauthor. Based on these considerations, we have concluded that our self-publishing contracts do not contain a significant financing component under ASC 606. \nVariable Consideration  Similar to former revenue\nrecognition guidance, we continue to make significant estimates related to variable consideration at the point of sale, including estimates for refunds and product returns. Under ASC 606, estimates of variable consideration are to be recognized\nbefore contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances, including when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of any estimated cumulative revenue will not occur. \nWe enter into agreements under which the amount of revenue we earn is contingent upon the amount of money raised by our customer over the contract term. Our\ncustomer is typically a charity or programmer that purchases blocks of programming time or spots to generate revenue from our audience members. Contract terms can range from a few weeks to a few months, depending the charity or programmer. If the\ncampaign does not generate a pre-determined level of donations or revenue to our customer, the consideration that we expect to be entitled to may vary above a minimum base level per the contract. Historically,\nunder ASC Topic 605, we reported variable consideration as revenue when the amount was fixed and determinable. Under ASC 606, variable consideration is to be estimated using the expected value or the most likely amount to the extent it is probable\nthat a significant reversal will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.  Based on the\nconstraints for using estimates of variable consideration within ASC 606, and our historical experience with these campaigns, we will continue to recognize revenue at the base amount of the campaign with variable consideration recognized when the\nuncertainty of each campaign is resolved. These constraints include: \n  99 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n(1) the amount of consideration received is highly susceptible to factors outside of our influence, specifically the extent to which our audience donates or contributes to our customer or\nprogrammer, (2) the length of time in which the uncertainty about the amount of consideration expected is to be resolved, and (3) our experience has shown these contracts have a large number and broad range of possible outcomes. \nTrade and Barter Transactions  In broadcasting,\ntrade or barter agreements are commonly used to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services. We may enter barter agreements to exchange airtime or digital advertising for goods or services that can be used in our\nbusiness or that can be sold to our audience under Listener Purchase Programs. The terms of these barter agreements permit us to preempt the barter airtime or digital campaign in favor of customers who purchase the airtime or digital campaign for\ncash. The value of these non-cash exchanges is included in revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the goods or services we receive. Each transaction must be reviewed to determine that the products,\nsupplies and/or services we receive have economic substance, or value to us. We record barter operating expenses upon receipt and usage of the products, supplies and services, as applicable. We record barter revenue as advertising spots or digital\ncampaigns are delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Barter revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which\ncase, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency.

promised amount of consideration for the effects\nof a significant financing component if the period between transfer of product and customer payment is expected to be less than one year at the time of contract inception; \n \n\n\n \n•\n \n We made the accounting policy election to not assess promised goods or services as performance obligations if\nthey are immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n We made the accounting policy election to exclude sales and similar taxes from the transaction price;\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n We made the accounting policy election to treat shipping and handling costs that occur after control transfers as\nfulfillment activities instead of assessing such activities as separate performance obligations; and   \n\n\n \n•\n \n We adopted the practical expedient not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts\nwith an original expected length of one year or less. \n  100

606, but shown for the purpose of identifying each revenue source\npresented in total revenue on our Consolidated Financial Statements within this annual report. \n  101 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nA summary of each of our revenue streams under ASC 606 is as follows: \nBlock Programming. We recognize revenue from the sale of blocks of airtime to program producers that typically range from 121/2, 25 or 50-minutes of time. We separate block program revenue into three categories, National, Local\nand Infomercial revenue. Our stations are classified by format, including Christian Teaching and Talk, News Talk, Contemporary Christian Music, Spanish Language Christian Teaching and Talk and Business. National and local programming content is\ncomplementary to our station format while infomercials are closely associated with long-form advertisements. Block Programming revenue may include variable consideration for charities and programmers that purchase blocks of airtime to generate\ndonations and contributions from our audience. Block programming revenue is recognized at the time of broadcast, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation.\nProgramming revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the programmer, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. \nSpot Advertising. We recognize revenue from the sale of airtime to local and national advertisers who purchase spot commercials of varying\nlengths. Spot Advertising may include variable consideration for charities and programmers that purchase spots to generate donations and contributions from our audience. Advertising revenue is recognized at the time of broadcast, which represents\nthe point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Advertising revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the advertiser, in which case, revenue is reported net of the\ncommission retained by the agency.  Network Revenue. Network revenue includes the sale of advertising time on our national network\nand fees earned from the syndication of programming on our national network. Network revenue is recognized at the time of broadcast, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance\nobligation. Network revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the customer, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. \nDigital Advertising. We recognize revenue from the sale of banner advertising on our owned and operated websites and on our own and operated\nmobile applications. Each of our radio stations, our digital media entities and certain of our publishing entities have custom websites and mobile applications that generate digital advertising revenue. Digital advertising revenue is recognized at\nthe time that the banner display is delivered, or the number of impressions delivered meets the previously agreed-upon performance criteria, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our\nperformance obligation. Digital advertising revenue is reported on a gross basis unless an agency represents the customer, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. \nBroadcast digital advertising revenue consists of local digital advertising, such as the sale of banner advertisements on our owned and operated websites, the\nsale of advertisements on our own and operated mobile applications, and advertisements in digital newsletters that we produce, as well an national digital advertising, or the sale of custom digital advertising solutions, such as web pages and social\nmedia campaigns, that we offer to our customers. Advertising revenue is recorded on a gross basis unless an agency represents the advertiser, in which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency. \nSalem Surround, our national multimedia advertising agency, offers a comprehensive suite of digital marketing services to develop and execute audience-based\nmarketing strategies for clients on both the national and local level. Salem Surround specializes in digital marketing services for each of our radio stations and websites as well as provides a full-service digital marketing strategy for each of our\nclients. In our role as a digital agency, our sales team provides our customers with integrated digital advertising solutions that optimize the performance of their campaign, which we view as one performance obligation. Our advertising campaigns are\ndesigned to be “white label” agreements between Salem and our advertiser, meaning we provide special care and attention to the details of the campaign. We provide custom digital product offerings, including tools for metasearch,\nretargeting, website design, reputation management, online listing services, and social media marketing. Digital advertising \n  102 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nsolutions may include third-party websites, such as Google or Facebook, which can be included in a digital advertising social media campaign. We manage all aspects of the digital campaign,\nincluding social media placements, review and approval of target audiences, and the monitoring of actual results to make modifications as needed. We may contract directly with a third-party, however, we are responsible for delivering the campaign\nresults to our customer with or without the third-party. We are responsible for any payments due to the third-party regardless of the campaign results and without regard to the status of payment from our customer. We have discretion in setting the\nprice to our customer without input or approval from the third-party. Accordingly, revenue is reported gross, as principal, as the performance obligation is delivered, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer\nthereby completing our performance obligation.  Digital Streaming. We recognize revenue from the sale of advertisements and from the\nplacement of ministry content that is streamed on our owned and operated websites and on our owned and operated mobile applications. Each of our radio stations, our digital media entities and certain publishing entities have custom websites and\nmobile applications that generate streaming revenue. Digital streaming revenue is recognized at the time that the content is delivered, or when the number of impressions delivered meets the previously agreed-upon performance criteria. Delivery of\nthe content represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Streaming revenue is reported on a gross basis unless an agency represents the customer, in which case, revenue is\nreported net of the commission retained by the agency.  Digital Downloads and e-books. We recognize\nrevenue from sale of downloaded materials, including videos, song tracks, sermons, content archives and e-books. Payments for downloaded materials are due in advance of the download, however, the download is\noften instant upon confirmation of payment. Digital download revenue is recognized at the time of download, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Revenue is\nrecorded at the gross amount due from the customer. All sales are final with no allowances made for returns.  Subscriptions. We recognize\nrevenue from the sale of subscriptions for financial publication digital newsletters, digital magazines, podcast subscriptions for on-air content, and subscriptions to our print magazine. Subscription terms\ntypically range from three months to two years, with a money-back guarantee for the first 30 days. Refunds after the first 30-day period are considered on a pro-rata\nbasis based on the number of publications issued and delivered. Payments are due in advance of delivery and can be made in full upon subscribing or in quarterly installments. Cash received in advance of the subscription term, including amounts that\nare refundable, is recorded in contract liabilities. Revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term at the point in time that each publication is transmitted or shipped, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the\ncustomer thereby completing our performance obligation. Revenue is reported net of estimated cancellations, which are based on our experience and historical cancellation rates during the cancellable period. \nBook Sales. We recognize revenue from the sale of books upon shipment, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the\ncustomer thereby completing the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded at the gross amount due from the customer, net of estimated sales returns and allowances based on our historical experience. Major new title releases represent a significant\nportion of the revenue in the current period. Print-based consumer books are sold on a fully returnable basis. We do not record assets or inventory for the value of returned books as they are considered used regardless of the condition returned. Our\nexperience with unsold or returned books is that their resale value is insignificant and they are often destroyed or disposed of.  e-Commerce. We recognize revenue from the sale of products sold through our digital platform. Payments for products are due in advance shipping. We record a contract liability when we receive customer\npayments in advance of shipment. The time frame from receipt of payment to shipment is typically one business day based on the time that an order is placed as compared to fulfillment. E-Commerce revenue is\nrecognized at the time of shipment, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our \n  103 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nperformance obligation. Revenue is reported net of estimated returns, which are based on our experience and historical return rates. Returned products are recorded in inventory if they are\nunopened and re-saleable with a corresponding reduction in the cost of goods sold.  Self-Publishing\nFees. We recognize revenue from self-publishing services through Salem Author Services (“SAS”), including book publishing and support services to independent authors. Services include book cover design, interior layout, printing,\ndistribution, marketing services and editing for print books and eBooks. As each book and related support services are unique to each author, authors must make payments in advance of the performance. Payments are typically made in installments over\nthe expected production timeline for each publication. We record contract liabilities equal to the amount of payments received, including those amounts that are fully or partially refundable. Contract liabilities were historically recorded under the\ncaption “deferred revenue” and are reported as current liabilities or long-term liabilities on our consolidated financial statements based on the time to fulfill the performance obligations under terms of the contract. Refunds are limited\nbased on the percentage completion of each publishing project.  Revenue is recognized upon completion of each performance obligation, which represents the\npoint in time that control of the product is transferred to the author, thereby completing our performance obligation. Revenue is recorded at the net amount due from the author, including discounts based on the service package. \nAdvertising—Print. We recognize revenue from the sale of print magazine advertisements. Revenue is recognized upon delivery of the print\nmagazine which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing the performance obligation. Revenue is reported on a gross basis unless an agency represents the customer, in which case, revenue is reported\nnet of the commission retained by the agency.  Other Revenue. Other revenue include various sources, such as event revenue, listener\npurchase programs, talent fees for on-air hosts, rental income for studios and towers, production services, and shipping and handling fees. We recognize event revenue, including fees earned for ticket sales\nand sponsorships, when the event occurs, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Revenue for all other products and services is recorded as the products or\nservices are delivered or performed, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. Other revenue is reported on a gross basis unless an agency represents the customer,\nin which case, revenue is reported net of the commission retained by the agency.  NOTE 5.

We periodically review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. This review requires us to estimate the fair value of the assets\nusing significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value, including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions\nand estimates we used, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. There were no indications of impairment during the period ended December 31, 2020. \nNOTE 7. OPERATING AND FINANCE LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS \nLeasing Transactions  Our leased assets include offices\nand studios, transmitter locations, antenna sites, towers, tower sites, and land. Our lease portfolio has terms remaining from less than one-year up to twenty years. Many of these leases contain options under\nwhich we can extend the term from five to twenty years, the exercise of which is at our sole discretion. Renewal options are excluded from our calculation of lease liabilities unless we are reasonably assured to exercise the renewal option. Our\nlease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. We lease certain properties from our principal stockholders or from trusts and partnerships created for the benefit of the principal stockholders and their\nfamilies. These leases are designated as Related Party leases in the details provided. We are obligated to pay taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges under a majority of our lease agreements. \nOperating leases are reflected on our balance sheet within operating lease ROU assets and the related current and\nnon-current operating lease liabilities. ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from lease\nagreement. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date, or the date on which the lessor makes the underlying asset available for use, based upon the present value of the lease payments over the respective lease\nterm. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, subject to any changes in the lease or expectation regarding the lease terms. Variable lease costs, such as common area maintenance, property taxes and insurance, are\nexpensed as incurred. \n  105 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDue to the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we\nbegan negotiating with landlords in early 2020 to obtain rent concessions to improve our short-term liquidity. In some instances, the renegotiations have led to agreements with landlords for rent abatements or rental deferrals. In accordance with\nthe FASB’s recent Staff Q&A regarding rent concessions related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will not apply the lease modification guidance under ASC 842 to rent concessions that result\nin the total payments required under the modified contract that are substantially the same as or less than total payments required by the original contract. If other terms of the lease are changed or renegotiated in connection with the concession\nprocess, then the changes will be treated as a modification in accordance with ASC 842.  For qualifying rent abatement concessions, we recorded negative\nlease expense for abatement during the period of relief. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized negative lease expense related to rent abatement concessions of $0.3 million. Additionally, deferred cash payments of\n$0.7 million remained at December 31, 2020 that are reported in short-term and long-term operating lease liabilities as applicable based on repayment terms that range from one year through December 2024. \nBalance Sheet  The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in\nrecording a non-cash transitional adjustment to operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities of $65.0 million and $74.4 million, respectively. The difference between the operating lease\nROU assets and operating lease liabilities at transition represented existing deferred rent expense and prepaid rent that was derecognized upon adoption. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded additional ROU assets and\ncorresponding lease liabilities of $4.2 million.

BROADCAST LICENSES \nWe account for broadcast licenses in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.” We do not amortize broadcast\nlicenses, but rather test for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the value may be impaired. In the case of our broadcast radio stations, we would not be able to operate the properties without the related\nbroadcast license for each property. Broadcast licenses are renewed with the FCC every eight years for a nominal fee that is expensed as incurred. We continually monitor our stations’ compliance with the various regulatory requirements that are\nnecessary for the FCC renewal and all of our broadcast licenses have been renewed. We expect all of our broadcast licenses to be renewed in the future and therefore, we consider our broadcast licenses to be indefinite-lived intangible assets. We are\nnot aware of any legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our broadcast licenses. The weighted-average period before the next renewal of our broadcasting licenses is 6.5 years. \nThe following table presents the changes in broadcasting licenses that include acquisitions and divestitures of radio stations and FM translators as described\nin Note 3 – Recent Transactions.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n2019\n \n  \n2020\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Balance, beginning of period before cumulative loss on impairment\n  \n$\n484,691\n \n  \n$\n441,143\n \n\n Accumulated loss on impairment\n  \n \n(108,375\n) \n  \n \n(103,285\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Balance, beginning of period after cumulative loss on impairment\n  \n \n376,316\n \n  \n \n337,858\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Acquisitions of radio stations\n  \n \n617\n \n  \n \n—  \n \n\n Acquisitions of FM translators and construction permits\n  \n \n35\n \n  \n \n—\n \n\n Capital Projects\n  \n \n300\n \n  \n \n—\n \n\n Disposition of radio stations and FM translators\n  \n \n(36,502\n) \n  \n \n(1,091\n) \n\n Impairments based on the estimated fair value of broadcast licenses\n  \n \n(2,908\n) \n  \n \n(16,994\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Balance, end of period after cumulative loss on impairment\n  \n$\n337,858\n \n  \n$\n319,773\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Balance, end of period before cumulative loss on impairment\n  \n$\n441,143\n \n  \n$\n440,052\n \n\n Accumulated loss on impairment\n  \n \n(103,285\n) \n  \n \n(120,279\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Balance, end of period after cumulative loss on impairment\n  \n$\n337,858\n \n  \n$\n319,773\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n  108 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBroadcast Licenses Impairment Test \nWe perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, which coincides with our budget and planning process for the upcoming year.\nThe unit of accounting we use to test broadcast licenses is the cluster level, which we define as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market, sharing the same building and equipment, and managed by a single general manager.\nThe cluster level is the lowest level for which discrete financial information and cash flows are available and the level reviewed by management to analyze operating results. \nThe first step of our impairment testing is to perform a qualitative assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that a broadcast license is impaired.\nThis qualitative assessment requires significant judgment when considering the events and circumstances that may affect the estimated fair value of our broadcast licenses. We review the significant assumptions and key estimates applicable to our\nprior year estimated fair value calculations to assess if events and circumstances have occurred that could affect these assumptions and key estimates. We also review internal benchmarks and the economic performance for each market cluster to assess\nif it is more likely than not that impairment exists.  As part of our qualitative assessment, we calculate the excess fair value, or the amount by which\nour prior year estimated fair value exceeds the current year carrying value. Based on our analysis and review, including the financial performance of each market, we believe that a 25% excess fair value margin is a reasonable benchmark for our\nqualitative analysis. Markets with an excess fair value of 25% or more, which have had no significant changes in the prior year assumptions and key estimates, are not likely to be impaired. \nOf the 16 markets for which an independent third-party fair value appraisal was obtained in the prior year, one market was sold, leaving 15 markets applicable\nto the current year. The table below presents the percentage within a range by which our prior year start-up income estimated fair value exceeds the current year carrying value of our broadcasting licenses:\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nGeographic Market Clusters as of December 31, 2020\n \n\n \n  \nPercentage Range By Which 2019 Estimated Fair ValueExceeds 2020 Carrying Value\n \n\n \n  \n£ 25%\n \n  \n>26%-50%\n \n  \n>51% to 75%\n \n  \n> +than 76%\n \n\n Number of accounting units\n  \n \n4\n \n  \n \n8\n \n  \n \n2\n \n  \n \n1\n \n\n Broadcast license carrying value(in thousands)\n  \n$\n92,983\n \n  \n$\n44,670\n \n  \n$\n27,465\n \n  \n$\n6,092\n \n We performed interim reviews of broadcast licenses in 11 markets during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and the quarter\nended September 30, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting stay-at-home orders that adversely impacted\nrevenue. These 11 markets were tested based on the excess fair value percentages noted in the most recent testing period. While we have seen improvements in revenue from the lowest point in 2020, the improvement has been slower than originally\nexpected due to extended and reinstated stay-at-home orders that unfavorably impacted the economy. We believe that revenue will continue to recover as restrictions are\nlifted and economic activity increases.  We engaged Bond & Pecaro, an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm, to assist us with\ndetermining the enterprise value of 11 of our market clusters at March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020. Based on our review and analysis, we determined that the carrying value of broadcast licenses in 7 of our market clusters were impaired\nas of the interim testing period ended March 31, 2020. We recorded an impairment charge of $17.0 million to the value of broadcast licenses in Chicago, Cleveland, Louisville, Philadelphia, Portland, Sacramento and Tampa as of the interim\ntesting period ended March 31, 2020. The impairment charges were driven by decreases in projected revenue due to the current estimated impact of COVID-19 and an increase in the WACC. We believe that these\nfactors are indicative of trends in the industry as a whole and not unique to our company or operations. There were no impairment charges recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2020. \n  109 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe results of our interim impairment reviews were as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Market Cluster\n  \nExcess Fair ValueMarch 31, 2020 Estimate\n \n \nExcess Fair ValueSeptember 30, 2020 Estimate\n \n\n Boston, MA\n  \n \n4.8\n% \n \n \n5.6\n% \n\n Chicago, IL\n  \n \n(9.0\n%) \n \n \n8.5\n% \n\n Cleveland, OH\n  \n \n(18.4\n%) \n \n \n6.5\n% \n\n Dallas, TX\n  \n \n8.5\n% \n \n \n11.8\n% \n\n Louisville, KY\n  \n \n(21.8\n%) \n \n \n13.8\n% \n\n New York, NY\n  \n \n7.3\n% \n \n \n15.9\n% \n\n Philadelphia, PA\n  \n \n(13.1\n%) \n \n \n5.1\n% \n\n Portland, OR\n  \n \n(14.8\n%) \n \n \n10.1\n% \n\n Sacramento, CA\n  \n \n(9.6\n%) \n \n \n4.6\n% \n\n San Francisco, CA\n  \n \n1.2\n% \n \n \n7.0\n% \n\n Tampa, FL\n  \n \n(28.0\n%) \n \n \n20.5\n% \n We included these 11 markets in our annual testing based on the excess fair value from our interim testing that was less than\n25% as follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nGeographic Market Clusters as December 31, 2020\n \n\n \n \nPercentage Range By Which March 2020 EstimatedFair Value Exceeds 2020 Carrying Value\n \n\n \n \n£ 25%\n \n \n>26%-50%\n \n \n>51% to 75%\n \n \n> +than 76%\n \n\n Number of accounting units\n \n \n11\n \n \n \n—  \n \n \n \n—  \n \n \n \n—  \n \n\n Broadcast license carrying value (in thousands)\n \n$\n188,858\n \n \n$\n—  \n \n \n$\n—  \n \n \n$\n—  \n \n The second part of our qualitative assessment consists of a review of the financial operating results for each market cluster.\nRadio stations are often sold on the basis of a multiple of projected cash flow, or Station Operating Income (“SOI”) defined as net broadcast revenue less broadcast operating expenses. See Item 6 – Selected Financial Data within this\nannual report for information on SOI, a non-GAAP measure. Numerous trade organizations and analysts review these radio station sales to track SOI multiples applicable to each transaction. Based on published\nreports and analysis of market transactions, we believe industry benchmarks to be in the six to seven times cash flow range. We elected an SOI benchmark of four as a reasonable indicator of fair value. Based on this qualitative review, we identified\nseven markets subject to further testing and six markets selected that were not tested in the prior for a total of 13 additional markets.

The estimated fair value of each market cluster was determined using the Greenfield Method, a form of the income approach. The premise of the Greenfield Method is that the\nvalue of a broadcast license is equivalent to a hypothetical start-up in which the only asset owned by the station as of the valuation date is the broadcast license. This approach eliminates factors that are\nunique to our operation of the station, including its format and historical financial performance. The method then assumes the entity has to purchase, build, or rent all of the other assets needed to operate a\n\n  110 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ncomparable station to the one in which the broadcast license is being utilized as of the valuation date. Cash flows are estimated and netted against all\nstart-up costs, expenses and investments necessary to achieve a normalized and mature state of operations, thus reflecting only the cash flows directly attributable to the broadcast license. A multi-year\ndiscounted cash flow approach is then used to determine the net present value of these cash flows to derive an indication of fair value. For cash flows beyond the projection period, a terminal value is calculated using the Gordon constant growth\nmodel and long-term industry growth rate assumptions based on long-term industry growth and Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) inflation rates.  The\nprimary assumptions used in the Greenfield Method are:   \n\n\n \n(1)\n gross operating revenue in the station’s designated market area, \n \n\n\n \n(2)\n normalized market share, \n \n\n\n \n(3)\n normalized profit margin, \n \n\n\n \n(4)\n duration of the “ramp-up” period to reach normalized\noperations, (which was assumed to be three years),   \n\n\n \n(5)\n estimated start-up costs (based on market size), \n \n\n\n \n(6)\n ongoing replacement costs of fixed assets and working capital, \n \n\n\n \n(7)\n the calculations of yearly net free cash flows to invested capital; and \n \n\n\n \n(8)\n amortization of the intangible asset, or the broadcast license. \nThe assumptions used reflect those of a hypothetical market participant and not necessarily the actual or projected results of Salem. The key estimates and\nassumptions used in the start-up income valuation for the broadcast licenses tested in each period were as follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Broadcast Licenses\n \nDecember 31, 2019\n \nMarch 31, 2020\n \nSeptember 30, 2020\n \nDecember 31, 2020\n\n Risk-adjusted discount rate\n \n9.0%\n \n9.5%\n \n8.5%\n \n8.5%\n\n Operating profit margin ranges\n \n4.0% - 33.8%\n \n4.6% - 33.8%\n \n4.3% - 33.3%\n \n4.2% - 31.0%\n\n Long-term revenue growth rates\n \n0.7% - 1.1%\n \n0.8% - 1.1%\n \n0.2% - 1.1%\n \n0.4% - 0.9%\n The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) developed based on data from\nsame or similar industry participants and publicly available market data as of the measurement date.

GOODWILL  We\naccount for goodwill in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.” We do not amortize goodwill, but rather test for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an\nasset may be impaired. We perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year, which coincides with our budget and planning process for the upcoming year. \nThe following table presents the changes in goodwill including business acquisitions as described in Note 3—Recent Transactions. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n    2019    \n \n  \n    2020    \n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Balance, beginning of period before cumulative loss on impairment,\n  \n$\n28,818\n \n  \n$\n28,454\n \n\n Accumulated loss on impairment\n  \n \n(2,029\n) \n  \n \n(4,456\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Balance, beginning of period after cumulative loss on impairment\n  \n \n26,789\n \n  \n \n23,998\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Acquisitions of digital media entities\n  \n \n6\n \n  \n \n66\n \n\n Disposition of radio stations\n  \n \n(29\n) \n  \n \n—  \n \n\n Disposition of digital media entities\n  \n \n(341\n) \n  \n \n—  \n \n\n Impairments based on the estimated fair value goodwill\n  \n \n(2,427\n) \n  \n \n(307\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Ending period balance\n  \n$\n23,998\n \n  \n$\n23,757\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Balance, end of period before cumulative loss on impairment\n  \n \n28,454\n \n  \n \n28,520\n \n\n Accumulated loss on impairment\n  \n \n(4,456\n) \n  \n \n(4,763\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Ending period balance\n  \n$\n23,998\n \n  \n$\n23,757\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n  112 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGoodwill Impairment Testing \nWhen performing our annual impairment testing for goodwill, the fair value of each applicable accounting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow\nanalysis, which is a form of the income approach. The discounted cash flow analysis utilizes a five to ten-year projection period to derive operating cash flow projections from a market participant view. We\nmake certain assumptions regarding future revenue growth based on industry market data, historical performance and our expectations of future performance. We also make assumptions regarding working capital requirements and ongoing capital\nexpenditures for fixed assets. Future net free cash flows are calculated on a debt free basis and discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate. The terminal year value is calculated using the Gordon constant growth method and\nlong-term growth rate assumptions based on long-term industry growth and GDP inflation rates. The resulting fair value estimates, net of any interest bearing debt, are then compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit’s net assets.\n The first step of our impairment testing is to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if events and circumstances have occurred that indicate it\nis more likely than not that the fair value of the assets, including goodwill, are less than their carrying values. We review the significant inputs used in our prior year fair value estimates to determine if any changes to those inputs should be\nmade. We estimate the fair value using a market approach and compare the estimated fair value of each entity to its carrying value, including goodwill. Under the market approach, we apply a multiple of four to each entities operating income to\nestimate the fair value. We believe that a multiple of four is a reasonable indicator of fair value as in Note 8, Broadcast Licenses.  If the results of\nour qualitative assessment indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying value, we perform a second quantitative review of the reporting unit. We engage an independent third-party appraisal and valuation firm to\nassist us with determining the enterprise value as part of this quantitative review.  Goodwill—Broadcast Markets \nThe unit of accounting we use to test goodwill associated with our radio stations is the cluster level, which we define as a group of radio stations operating\nin the same geographic market, sharing the same building and equipment and managed by a single general manager. The cluster level is the lowest level for which discrete financial information and cash flows are available and the level reviewed by\nmanagement to analyze operating results. Four of our 31 market clusters have goodwill associated with them as of our annual testing period ended December 31, 2020. \nThe key estimates and assumptions used for our enterprise valuations were as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Broadcast Markets Enterprise Valuations\n  \nDecember 31, 2019\n  \nDecember 31, 2020\n\n Risk-adjusted discount rate\n  \n9.0%\n  \n8.5%\n\n Operating profit margin ranges\n  \n(31.1%) - 38.7%\n  \n(11.4%) - 41.5%\n\n Long-term revenue growth rates\n  \n0.7% -0.9%\n  \n0.5% - 0.8%\n The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the WACC developed based on data from same or similar industry participants and\npublicly available market data as of the measurement date.  Based on our qualitative review, we tested four market clusters for impairment of goodwill. We\nengaged Bond & Pecaro, an independent appraisal and valuation firm, to assist us in estimating the enterprise of value our market clusters to test goodwill for impairment. The enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are\ninstalled as part of an operating business rather than as a hypothetical start-up. The analysis includes both an income and cost approach to valuation. The income approach uses a discounted cash flow\nprojection while the cost approach, or “stick” value of the underlying assets is used. \n  113 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBased on our review and analysis, we determined that no impairment charges were necessary to the carrying\nvalue of our broadcast market goodwill as of the annual testing period ended December 31, 2020.

The financial statements for SWN include the operating results and cash flows for our Christian content websites and our church product websites. The financial\nstatements for Townhall.com® reflect the operating results for each of our conservative opinion websites. Eagle Financial Publications include our investing websites and related digital\npublications. The entity level is the level reviewed by management and the lowest level for which discrete financial information is available.  Two of our\ndigital media entities have goodwill associated with them as of our annual testing period ended December 31, 2020. We tested one of these entities for impairment because it was not tested in the prior year. We engaged Bond & Pecaro, an\nindependent appraisal and valuation firm, to assist us in estimating the enterprise of value of the entity for impairment. The enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are installed as part of an operating business rather than as a\nhypothetical start-up.

Regnery® Publishing\nis a book publisher based in Washington DC that operates from a stand-alone facility under one general manager, with operating results and cash flows of reported at the entity level. Salem Author Services operates from a stand-alone facility in\nOrlando, Florida under one general manager who is responsible for the operating results and cash flows. Singing News® produces and distributes a print magazine. The entity level is the\nlevel reviewed by management and the lowest level for which discrete financial information is available.  We performed an interim review of goodwill\nduring the first quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting stay-at-home orders that began to adversely\nimpact revenue. We assessed a variety of factors, including media industry forecasts for the remainder of 2020 and the amount by which the prior estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value including goodwill. Based on our review and analysis,\nwe recorded an impairment charge of $0.3 million, including a $0.1 million charge to the carrying value of goodwill associated with Salem Author Services. The impairment charge was driven by a decrease in operating margins due to the\nimpact of COVID-19 on revenue and an increase in the WACC. We believe that these factors are indicative of trends in the industry as a whole and not unique to our company or operations. \nTwo of our publishing entities have goodwill associated with them as of our annual testing period ended December 31, 2020. We tested one of these\nentities because it had not been tested in the prior year and we tested the other entity based on the amount by which the prior estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value. We engaged Bond & Pecaro, an independent appraisal and\nvaluation firm, to assist us in estimating the enterprise of value this publishing entity to test goodwill for impairment.

OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS \nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of mastheads, or the graphic elements that identify our publications to readers and advertisers. These include\ncustomized typeset page headers, section headers, and column graphics as well as other name and identity stylized elements within the body of each publication. We are not aware of any legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially\nlimit the useful life of our mastheads. We account for mastheads in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. We do not amortize mastheads, but rather test for impairment annually or more frequently if events or\ncircumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.  We performed an interim review of mastheads during the three months ended March 31, 2020 due\nto the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting stay-at-home orders that began to adversely impact revenue. We assessed a variety of\nfactors, including media industry forecasts and the amount by which the prior estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value. The results of our interim impairment analysis are described further below. \nImpairment testing requires estimates of the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. We believe that these fair value estimates are critical\naccounting estimates as the value is significant in relation to our total assets and the estimates incorporate variables and assumptions based on our experiences and judgment about our future operating performance. Fair value measurements use\nsignificant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value, including assumptions about risk. If actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and\nestimates used in our estimates, we are subject to future impairment charges, the amount of which may be material. The unobservable inputs are defined in FASB ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” as Level 3 inputs\ndiscussed in detail in Note 13 – Fair Value Measurements.  For the interim testing, we engaged Bond & Pecaro, an independent appraisal and\nvaluation firm, to assist us in estimating the fair value of mastheads using a Relief from Royalty method, a form of the income approach. The Relief from Royalty method estimates the fair value of mastheads through use of a discounted cash flow\nmodel that incorporates a hypothetical “royalty rate” that a third-party owner would be willing to pay in lieu of owning the asset. The royalty rate is based on observed royalty rates for comparable assets as of the measurement date. We\nadjust the selected royalty rate to account for a percentage of the royalty fee that could be attributed to the use of other intangibles, such as goodwill, time in existence, trade secrets and industry expertise. The adjusted royalty rate represents\nthe royalty fee remaining that could be attributed to the use of the masthead only.  Pre-tax royalty income is\nbased on a 10-year revenue forecast and assumed to carry on into perpetuity. Revenue beyond the projection period (terminal year) is based on estimated long-term industry growth rates. The analysis also\nincorporates the present value of the tax amortization benefit associated with mastheads. The key estimates and assumptions are as follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mastheads\n  \nDecember 31, 2019\n \nMarch 31, 2020\n\n Risk-adjusted discount rate\n  \n10.0%\n \n10.5%\n\n Long-term revenue growth rates\n  \n(4.0%) - (1.0%)\n \n(1.0%) - (25.0%)\n\n Royalty rate\n  \n3.00%\n \n3.00%\n The risk-adjusted discount rate reflects the WACC developed based on data from same or similar industry participants and\npublicly available market data as of the measurement date. Based on our review and analysis, we recorded an impairment charge to mastheads of $17,300 as of the annual testing period ended December 31, 2019 and $0.3 million as of the\ninterim testing period ended March 31, 2020. The impairment charges were driven by decreases in the projected long-term revenue growth rates for the print magazine industry and an increase in the WACC. We believe that these factors are\nindicative of trends in the industry as a whole and not unique to our company or operations.

LONG-TERM DEBT \nSalem Media Group, Inc. has no independent assets or operations, the subsidiary guarantees relating to certain debt are full and unconditional and joint and\nseveral, and any subsidiaries of Salem Media Group, Inc. other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor. \n  117 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n6.75% Senior Secured Notes \nOn May 19, 2017, we issued the Notes in a private placement. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by our existing subsidiaries (the\n“Subsidiary Guarantors”). The Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per year and mature on June 1, 2024, unless they are earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest initially accrued on the Notes from May 19, 2017 and is payable\nsemi-annually, in cash in arrears, on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2017.  The Notes are secured by a\nfirst-priority lien on substantially all assets of ours and the Subsidiary Guarantors other than the ABL Facility Priority Collateral (as described below) (the “Notes Priority Collateral”). There is no direct lien on our FCC licenses to\nthe extent prohibited by law or regulation (other than the economic value and proceeds thereof).  The Notes were redeemable, in whole or in part, at any\ntime on or before June 1, 2020 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus a “make-whole” premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. At any time on or\nafter June 1, 2020, the Notes are redeemable at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount to be redeemed) set forth in the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption\ndate.  The indenture relating to the Notes (the “Indenture”) contains covenants that, among other things and subject in each case to certain\nspecified exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders; (iii) make investments;\n(iv) create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; (v) merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets; (vi) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (vii) sell or\ntransfer assets.  The Indenture provides for the following events of default (each, an “Event of Default”): (i) default in payment of principal\nor premium on the Notes at maturity, upon repurchase, acceleration, optional redemption or otherwise; (ii) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the Notes; (iii) the failure by us or certain restricted subsidiaries to comply with\nother agreements in the Indenture or the Notes, in certain cases subject to notice and lapse of time; (iv) the failure of any guarantee by certain significant Subsidiary Guarantors to be in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance\nwith its terms, subject to notice and lapse of time; (v) certain accelerations (including failure to pay within any grace period) of other indebtedness of ours or any restricted subsidiary if the amount accelerated (or so unpaid) is at least\n$15 million; (vi) certain judgments for the payment of money in excess of $15 million; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us or any significant subsidiary; and (viii) certain defaults with\nrespect to any collateral having a fair market value in excess of $15 million. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal of\nthe Notes and any accrued interest on the Notes to be due and payable immediately, subject to remedy or cure in certain cases. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Notes being due and payable\nimmediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under the Indenture. \nBased on the balance of the Notes currently outstanding, we are required to pay $14.6 million per year in interest on the Notes. As of December 31,\n2020, accrued interest on the Notes was $1.2 million.  We incurred debt issuance costs of $6.3 million that were recorded as a reduction of the\ndebt proceeds that are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the life of the Notes using the effective interest method. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.7 million and\n$0.9 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs associated with the Notes was amortized to interest expense.  We may from time to time, depending\non market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, seek to repurchase the Notes in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, as market conditions\nwarrant. \n  118 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBased on the then existing market conditions, we completed repurchases of our 6.75% Senior Secured Notes at\namounts less than face value as follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Date\n \n\nPrincipalRepurchased\n \n \n Cash Paid\n \n \n\n% of FaceValue\n \n \n\nBond IssueCosts\n \n \n Net Gain\n \n\n \n \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\nJanuary 30, 2020\n \n$\n 2,250\n \n \n$\n 2,194\n \n \n \n97.50\n% \n \n$\n 34\n \n \n$\n 22\n \n\nJanuary 27, 2020\n \n \n1,245\n \n \n \n1,198\n \n \n \n96.25\n% \n \n \n20\n \n \n \n27\n \n\nDecember 27, 2019\n \n \n3,090\n \n \n \n2,874\n \n \n \n93.00\n% \n \n \n48\n \n \n \n167\n \n\nNovember 27, 2019\n \n \n5,183\n \n \n \n4,548\n \n \n \n87.75\n% \n \n \n82\n \n \n \n553\n \n\nNovember 15, 2019\n \n \n3,791\n \n \n \n3,206\n \n \n \n84.58\n% \n \n \n61\n \n \n \n524\n \n\nMarch 28, 2019\n \n \n2,000\n \n \n \n1,830\n \n \n \n91.50\n% \n \n \n37\n \n \n \n134\n \n\nMarch 28, 2019\n \n \n2,300\n \n \n \n2,125\n \n \n \n92.38\n% \n \n \n42\n \n \n \n133\n \n\nFebruary 20, 2019\n \n \n125\n \n \n \n114\n \n \n \n91.25\n% \n \n \n2\n \n \n \n9\n \n\nFebruary 19, 2019\n \n \n350\n \n \n \n319\n \n \n \n91.25\n% \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n24\n \n\nFebruary 12, 2019\n \n \n1,325\n \n \n \n1,209\n \n \n \n91.25\n% \n \n \n25\n \n \n \n91\n \n\nJanuary 10, 2019\n \n \n570\n \n \n \n526\n \n \n \n92.25\n% \n \n \n9\n \n \n \n35\n \n\nDecember 21, 2018\n \n \n2,000\n \n \n \n1,835\n \n \n \n91.75\n% \n \n \n38\n \n \n \n127\n \n\nDecember 21, 2018\n \n \n1,850\n \n \n \n1,702\n \n \n \n92.00\n% \n \n \n35\n \n \n \n113\n \n\nDecember 21, 2018\n \n \n1,080\n \n \n \n999\n \n \n \n92.50\n% \n \n \n21\n \n \n \n60\n \n\nNovember 17, 2018\n \n \n1,500\n \n \n \n1,357\n \n \n \n90.50\n% \n \n \n29\n \n \n \n114\n \n\nMay 4, 2018\n \n \n4,000\n \n \n \n3,770\n \n \n \n94.25\n% \n \n \n86\n \n \n \n144\n \n\nApril 10, 2018\n \n \n4,000\n \n \n \n3,850\n \n \n \n96.25\n% \n \n \n87\n \n \n \n63\n \n\nApril 9, 2018\n \n \n2,000\n \n \n \n1,930\n \n \n \n96.50\n% \n \n \n43\n \n \n \n27\n \n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n\n\n \n$\n38,659\n \n \n$\n35,586\n \n \n\n\n\n \n$\n706\n \n \n$\n2,367\n \n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility \nOn May 19, 2017, the company entered into the ABL Facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) by and among us and our\nsubsidiaries party thereto as borrowers, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and lead arranger, and the lenders that are parties thereto. We used the proceeds of the ABL Facility, together with the net proceeds from the\nNotes offering, to repay outstanding borrowings under our previously existing senior credit facilities, and related fees and expenses. Current proceeds from the ABL Facility are used to provide ongoing working capital and for other general corporate\npurposes, including permitted acquisitions.  The ABL Facility is a five-year $30.0 million revolving credit facility due March 1, 2024, which\nincludes a $5.0 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a $7.5 million subfacility for swingline loans. All borrowings under the ABL Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to a base rate or LIBOR plus a spread. The spread,\nwhich is based on an availability-based measure, ranges from 0.50% to 1.00% for base rate borrowings and 1.50% to 2.00% for LIBOR borrowings. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate may increase by 2.00% per annum. Amounts outstanding under\nthe ABL Facility may be paid and then reborrowed at our discretion without penalty or premium. Additionally, we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance from 0.25% to 0.375% per year based on the level of borrowings. \nOn October 20, 2020, we entered into a fourth amendment to our ABL Facility that provides a one-time waiver with\nrespect to the current covenant testing period allowing the covenant trigger event date be the first day after the availability on the ABL Facility had equaled or exceeded (1) 15% of the maximum revolver amount and (2) $4.5 million and a waiver\npermitting our July 2020 financial statements to be issued on or before September 30, 2020 due to delays that were caused by a ransomware attack.  On\nApril 7, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to ABL Facility that increased the advance rate on eligible accounts receivable from 85% to 90% and extended the maturity date from May 19, 2022 to March 1, 2024. The\n\n  119 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nApril 7, 2020 amendment also allows for an alternative benchmark rate that may include SOFR due to LIBOR being scheduled to be discontinued at the end of calendar year 2021. \nAvailability under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of (a) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount\nbased on the value of certain real property. As of December 31, 2020, the amount available under the ABL Facility was $24.2 million of which $5.0 million was outstanding. The ABL Facility has a first-priority lien on our and the\nSubsidiary Guarantors’ accounts receivable, inventory, deposit and securities accounts, certain real estate and related assets (the “ABL Facility Priority Collateral”) and by a second-priority lien on the Notes Priority Collateral.\nThere is no direct lien on our FCC licenses to the extent prohibited by law or regulation (other than the economic value and proceeds thereof).  The\nCredit Agreement includes a springing fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0, which is tested during the period commencing on the last day of the fiscal month most recently ended prior to the date on which Availability (as defined in the Credit\nAgreement) is less than the greater of 15% of the Maximum Revolver Amount (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and $4.5 million and continuing for a period of 60 consecutive days after the first day on which Availability exceeds such threshold\namount. The Credit Agreement also includes other negative covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this type, including covenants that, subject to exceptions described in the Credit Agreement, restrict our ability and the ability of our\nsubsidiaries (i) to incur additional indebtedness; (ii) to make investments; (iii) to make distributions, loans or transfers of assets; (iv) to enter into, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any liens, (v) to sell\nassets; (vi) to enter into transactions with affiliates; (vii) to merge or consolidate with, or dispose of all assets to a third party, except as permitted thereby; (viii) to prepay indebtedness; and (ix) to pay dividends. \nThe Credit Agreement provides for the following events of default: (i) default for non-payment of any principal\nor letter of credit reimbursement when due or any interest, fees or other amounts within five days of the due date; (ii) the failure by any borrower or any subsidiary to comply with any covenant or agreement contained in the Credit Agreement or\nany other loan document, in certain cases subject to applicable notice and lapse of time; (iii) any representation or warranty made pursuant to the Credit Agreement or any other loan document is incorrect in any material respect when made;\n(iv) certain defaults of other indebtedness of any borrower or any subsidiary of indebtedness of at least $10 million; (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to any borrower or any subsidiary; (vi) certain\njudgments for the payment of money of $10 million or more; (vii) a change of control; and (viii) certain defaults relating to the loss of FCC licenses, cessation of broadcasting and termination of material station contracts. If an\nevent of default occurs and is continuing, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may accelerate the amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we\nremain, in compliance with all of the covenants under Credit Agreement.  We incurred debt issue costs of $0.9 million that were recorded as an asset\nand are being amortized to non-cash interest expense over the term of the ABL Facility using the effective interest method. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.2 million of\ndebt issuance costs associated with the ABL Facility was amortized to interest expense. At December 31, 2020, the blended interest rate on amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility was 2.5%. \nWe report outstanding balances on the ABL Facility as short-term regardless of the maturity date based on use of the ABL Facility to fund ordinary and\ncustomary operating cash needs with frequent repayments. We believe that our borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service requirements for at\nleast the next twelve months. At December 31, 2020, we were, and we remain, in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Agreement. \n  120 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSummary of long-term debt obligations \nLong-term debt consisted of the following:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nAs of December 31,\n \n\n \n  \n2019\n \n  \n2020\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n 6.75% Senior Secured Notes\n  \n$\n219,836\n \n  \n$\n216,341\n \n\n Less unamortized debt issuance costs based on imputed interest rate of 7.08%\n  \n \n(3,368\n) \n  \n \n(2,577\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n 6.75% Senior Secured Notes net carrying value\n  \n \n216,468\n \n  \n \n213,764\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility principal outstanding\n  \n \n12,426\n \n  \n \n5,000\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Long-term debt less unamortized debt issuance costs\n  \n \n228,894\n \n  \n \n218,764\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Less current portion\n  \n \n(12,426\n) \n  \n \n(5,000\n) \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n Long-term debt less unamortized debt issuance costs, net of current portion\n  \n$\n216,468\n \n  \n$\n213,764\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n In addition to the outstanding amounts listed above, we also have interest payments related to our long-term debt as follows\nas of December 31, 2020:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n $5.0 million under the ABL Facility, with interest spread ranging from Base Rate plus 0.50% to 1.00% for\nbase rate borrowings and LIBOR plus 1.50% to 2.00% for LIBOR borrowings;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n $216.3 million aggregate principal amount of Notes with semi-annual interest payments at an annual rate of\n6.75%; and   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375% per annum on the unused portion of the ABL Facility. \nMaturities of Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations \nPrincipal repayment requirements under all long-term debt agreements outstanding at December 31, 2020 for each of the next five years and thereafter are\nas follows:   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n Amount\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n For the Year Ended December 31,\n  \n\n\n\n\n 2021\n  \n$\n5,000\n \n\n 2022\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n 2023\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n 2024\n  \n \n216,341\n \n\n 2025\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n Thereafter\n  \n \n—  \n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n\n  \n$\n221,341\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n \n NOTE 13. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES \nFair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date.” FASB ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” (“ASC 820”) established a hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability\nutilized in measuring fair value. This framework defines three levels of inputs to the \n  121 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nfair value measurement process and requires that each fair value measurement be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in\nits entirety. The three broad levels of inputs defined by the ASC 820 hierarchy are as follows:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Level 1 Inputs—quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets\nor liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date;   \n\n\n \n•\n \n Level 2 Inputs—inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that\nare observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and\n  \n\n\n \n•\n \n Level 3 Inputs—unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. These unobservable\ninputs reflect the entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (which might include the\nreporting entity’s own data).  Under ASC 820, a fair value measurement of a nonfinancial asset considers a market\nparticipant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. Therefore, fair value is a market-based\nmeasurement and not an entity-specific measurement. It is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The exit price objective of a fair value measurement applies regardless of the reporting\nentity’s intent and/or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date.  As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value\nof cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued interest approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of such instruments. The carrying amount of the Notes at December 31, 2020\nwas $216.3 million compared to the estimated fair value of $199.0 million, based on the prevailing interest rates and trading activity of our Notes. \nWe have certain assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis that are adjusted to fair value only\nwhen the carrying values exceed the fair values. The categorization of the framework used to price the assets is considered Level 3 due to the subjective nature of the unobservable inputs used when estimating the fair value. \nThe following table summarizes the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \nDecember 31, 2020\n \n\n \n  \nCarrying Value onBalance Sheet\n \n  \nFair Value Measurement Category\n \n\n \n  \nLevel 1\n \n  \nLevel 2\n \n  \nLevel 3\n \n\n \n  \n(Dollars in thousands)\n \n\n Liabilities:\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n Long-term debt less unamortized debt issuance costs\n  \n$\n218,764\n \n  \n \n—  \n \n  \n$\n201,263\n \n  \n \n—  \n \n NOTE 14. INCOME TAXES  We\nrecognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between our consolidated financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure these deferred\ntax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a change in tax rates in\nincome in the period that includes the date of the change.  For financial reporting purposes, we recorded a valuation allowance of $28.4 million as\nof December 31, 2020 to offset $28.4 million of the deferred tax assets related to the federal net operating loss carryforwards, and $19.7 million of the deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards of\n$15.7 million and \n  122 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nother financial statement accrual assets of $4.0 million, for a total valuation allowance of $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

For financial reporting purposes at December 31, 2019, we had a valuation\nallowance of $8.9 million, net of federal benefit, to offset the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards along with a valuation allowance of $4.1 million to offset the deferred tax assets related to the\nfederal net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of our adjusted cumulative three-year pre-tax book loss as of December 31, 2020, we performed an assessment of positive and negative evidence with\nrespect to the realization of our net deferred tax assets. This assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the availability of carryforwards and estimates of projected future taxable income. The economic\nuncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic provided additional negative evidence that outweighed positive evidence resulting in our conclusion that additional deferred tax assets of $35.1 million related to\nfederal and state net operating loss carryforwards are more likely than not to be not realized. As such, an additional valuation allowance of $35.1 million was recorded, for a total valuation allowance of $48.1 million as of the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020.  The amortization of our indefinite-lived intangible assets for tax purposes, but not for book purposes, creates deferred tax\nliabilities. A reversal of deferred tax liabilities may occur when indefinite-lived intangibles: (1) become impaired; or (2) are sold, which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of\nstations or the entire company in a taxable transaction. Due to the amortization for tax purposes and not book purposes of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, we expect to continue to generate deferred tax liabilities in future periods exclusive\nof any impairment losses in future periods. These deferred tax liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards result in differences between our provision for income tax and cash paid for taxes. \nNOTE 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  The company\nenters into various agreements in the normal course of business that contain minimum guarantees. Minimum guarantees are typically tied to future events, such as future revenue earned in excess of the contractual level. Accordingly, the fair value of\nthese arrangements is zero. \n  124 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe company also records contingent earn-out consideration\nrepresenting the estimated fair value of future liabilities associated with acquisitions that may have additional payments due upon the achievement of certain performance targets. The fair value of the contingent\nearn-out consideration is estimated as of the acquisition date as the present value of the expected contingent payments as determined using weighted probabilities of the expected payment amounts. We review the\nprobabilities of possible future payments to estimate the fair value of any contingent earn-out consideration on a quarterly basis over the earn-out period. Actual\nresults are compared to the estimates and probabilities of achievement used in our forecasts. Should actual results of the acquired business increase or decrease as compared to our estimates and assumptions, the estimated fair value of the\ncontingent earn-out consideration liability will increase or decrease, up to the contracted limit, as applicable. Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent\nearn-out consideration are reflected in our results of operations in the period in which they are identified. Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent\nearn-out consideration may materially impact and cause volatility in our operating results.  The company and its\nsubsidiaries, incident to its business activities, are parties to a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits, arbitration and other claims. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance. The company\nevaluates claims based on what we believe to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The company maintains insurance that may provide coverage for such matters. Consequently, the company is unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of\nmonetary liability or the financial impact with respect to these matters. The company believes, at this time, that the final resolution of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially adversely affect the company’s\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  NOTE 16. STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN \nOur Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) provides for grants of equity-based awards to employees, non-employee directors and officers, and advisors of the company (“Eligible Persons”). The Plan is designed to promote the interests of the company using equity investment interests to attract, motivate,\nand retain individuals.  A maximum of 8,000,000 shares are authorized under the Plan. All awards have restriction periods tied primarily to employment\nand/or service. The Plan allows for accelerated or continued vesting in certain circumstances as defined in the Plan including death, disability, a change in control, and termination or retirement. Our Board, or a committee appointed by our Board,\nhas discretion subject to limits defined in the Plan, to modify the terms of any outstanding award. Awards granted to non-employee directors are made in exchange for their services to the company as directors\nand therefore, the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 505-50 Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees is not applicable. \nUnder the Plan, our Board, or a committee appointed by our Board, may impose restrictions on the exercise of awards during\npre-defined blackout periods. Insiders may participate in plans established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act that allow them to exercise awards subject to pre-established criteria. \n  125 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe recognize non-cash stock-based compensation expense based on the\nestimated fair value of awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 Compensation—Stock Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense fluctuates over time as a result of the vesting periods for outstanding awards and the number of\nawards that actually vest.

Incentive and non-qualified stock option awards allow the recipient to purchase shares of our common stock at a set price, not to be less than the closing market price on the date\nof award, for no consideration payable by the recipient. The related number of shares underlying the stock option is fixed at the time of the grant. Options generally vest over a four-year period with a maximum term of five years from the vesting\ndate. In addition, certain management and professional level employees may receive stock option awards upon the commencement of employment.  The Plan also\nallows for awards of restricted stock that contain transfer restrictions under which they cannot be sold, pledged, transferred or assigned until the period specified in the award, generally from one to five years. Restricted stock awards are\nindependent of option grants and are granted at no cost to the recipient other than applicable taxes owed by the recipient. The awards are considered issued and outstanding from the date of grant. \nThe fair value of each award is estimated as of the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected volatility reflects the\nconsideration of the historical volatility of our common stock as determined by the closing price over a six to ten-year term commensurate with the expected term of the award. Expected dividends reflect the\namount of quarterly distributions authorized and declared on our Class A and Class B common stock as of the grant date. The expected term of the awards is based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior.\nThe risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected term of the award are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted. We have used historical data to estimate future forfeiture rates to apply\nagainst the gross amount of compensation expense determined using the valuation model. These estimates have approximated our actual forfeiture rates. \n  126 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the stock options using

SEGMENT DATA \nFASB ASC Topic 280, “Segment Reporting,” requires companies to provide certain information about their operating segments. We have three\noperating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating segments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of senior\nexecutives, assess the performance of each operating segment and determine the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We continually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our business and\nmay make changes as necessary.  We measure and evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that do not include\nallocations of costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury, which are reported as unallocated corporate expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations included in\nthis annual report . We also exclude costs such as amortization, depreciation, taxes and interest expense.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS \nIn January 2021, we applied for $11.2 million in PPP loans available under the CAA for our radio station clusters and our networks. We have received\n$8.4 million in funding and expect to receive the remaining amount in the next several weeks.  On February 4, 2021, we entered into an APA to\nacquire KDIA-AM and KDYA-AM in San Francisco, California for $0.6 million. The purchase is subject to the approval of the FCC and is expected to close in the first\nhalf of 2021.  On January 4, 2021, we granted 100,000 stock options to the President of our New Media division. The fair value of the stock award was\nmeasured based on the grant date market price of our common shares.  Subsequent events reflect all applicable transactions through the date of the filing.\n ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. \nNone.  ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND\nPROCEDURES.  (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. \nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,\nas appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. \nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Exchange Act\n\n  133 \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nRule 13a-15(e)). Based upon the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2020, the end of the period covered by this annual report.   \n\n\n(b)\n Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nInternal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:   \n\n\n \n(1)\n Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the assets of the Company;   \n\n\n \n(2)\n Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of managements and directors of the Company; and \n \n\n\n \n(3)\n Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Internal control over financial\nreporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses\nin judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may\nnot be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards\nto reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\nfor the Company. Management has used the framework set forth in the 2013 report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission to\nevaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year. \n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the\nCompany’s fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. \nITEM 9B.

The CARES Act provides\nopportunities for additional liquidity, loan guarantees, and other government programs to support companies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and their employees. On December 27, 2020, Congress passed the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act (“CAA”) that includes a second relief package, which, among other things, provides for an extension of the Payroll Support Program established by the CARES Act. We have utilized certain benefits of the CARES\nAct, and we may be entitled to benefits under the CAA based on our individual locations, including: ",

The CAA provides for another round of direct payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, education funding, and aid to sectors still\nreeling from the economic fallout of the pandemic. While these measures may benefit many of our customers, we cannot assure you that the implementation of these measures will offset the negative impact of\nCOVID-19 on our customers. If the CAA or any additional stimulus measures are not sufficient to remediate the financial stress on our customers as a result of the pandemic, we may experience ongoing challenges\nin growing and maintain revenue and we may experience an increase in delinquencies that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods. ",
        "We continue to review and consider any available potential benefit under the CARES Act and the CAA for which we qualify. We cannot predict the manner in which\nsuch benefits or any of the other benefits described herein will be allocated or administered and we cannot assure you that we will be able to access such benefits in a timely manner or at all. If the U.S. government or any other governmental\nauthority agrees to provide such aid under the CARES Act, the CAA, or any other crisis relief assistance it may impose certain requirements on the recipients of the aid, including restrictions on executive officer compensation, dividends, prepayment\nof debt, limitations on debt and other similar restrictions that may apply for a period of time after the aid is repaid or redeemed in full. ",
        "Due to the\nadverse economic impact, we reforecast our anticipated results extending through March 2022. Our reforecast includes the impact of certain of these cost-cutting measures. Based on our current and expected economic outlook and our current and\nexpected funding needs, we believe that the borrowing capacity under our current credit facilities, together with cash on hand, allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund necessary capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service\nrequirements for at least the next twelve months, including the working capital deficit at December 31, 2020.

In addition, it is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the OCC could assert that payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound\n      practice. The amount that the Bank may pay in dividends is further restricted due to the fact that the Bank must maintain a certain minimum amount of capital to be considered a “well capitalized” institution as well as a separate capital conservation\n      buffer, as further described under “Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Operations - Regulatory Matters- Dividends” in this Form 10-K.",

These modified\n        loans are classified as performing and are not considered past due.  Loans are to be placed on non-accrual when it becomes apparent that payment of interest or recovery of all principal is questionable, and the COVID-19 related modification is no\n        longer considered short-term or the modification is deemed ineffective.  The Company anticipates additional loans to be modified due to the effects of COVID-19 in the coming periods.  At December 31, 2020, the Company had 13 COVID-19 related\n        modified loans with a total balance of $5.1 million.  Through the date of this filing, the Company has not experienced any loan charge-offs caused by the\n        economic impact from COVID-19.

        "The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Company and HBC on January 1, 2015 (subject to phase-in periods for some of their components). The Basel III Capital Rules: (i) introduce a new capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”), and a related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments, which are instruments treated as Tier 1 instruments under the prior capital rules that meet certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions or adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital, as compared to existing regulations. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, the most common form of additional Tier 1 capital is noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allowance for credit losses on loans, in each case, subject to the Basel III Capital Rules’ specific requirements.",
        "The Basel III Capital Rules also introduced a “capital conservation buffer,” composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer was phased in over a three-year period until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019. As of January 1, 2019, the Company and HBC must maintain the following fully phased-in minimum capital ratios:",
        "The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that: (i) mortgage servicing rights; (ii) deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks; and (iii) significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and were phased-in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items are not excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets or with less than $10 billion of on-balance sheet foreign exposures), including the Company and HBC, may make a one-time permanent election to exclude these items. The Company and HBC made this election in the first quarter of 2015’s call reports in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio.",

The new capital rules generally result in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes, including certain CRE mortgages.

The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement HCC is expected to commit resources to support HBC, including at times when HCC may not be in a financial position to do so. HCC must stand ready to use its available resources to provide adequate capital to the subsidiary bank during periods of financial stress or adversity. HCC must also maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting HBC. HCC’s failure to meet its source of strength obligations may constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve’s regulations or both. The source of strength doctrine most directly affects bank holding companies where a bank holding company’s subsidiary bank fails to maintain adequate capital levels. In such a situation, the subsidiary bank will be required by the bank’s federal regulator to take “prompt corrective action.” Any capital loans by a bank holding company to HBC are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of HBC.

The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, and reputational risk. In particular, recent regulatory pronouncements have focused on operational risk, which arises from the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. New products and services, third-party risk management and cybersecurity are critical sources of operational risk that financial institutions are expected to address in the current environment.

In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications.

        "The CFPB has recently announced its intention to embark on rulemaking about consumer control over their financial data.  California is also actively enacting legislation relating to data privacy and data protection, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020.  The CCPA granted California consumers robust data privacy rights and control over their personal information, including the right to know, the right to delete, and the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. The CCPA was recently further expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), which provides additional privacy rights to California residents and creates a new agency tasked with implementing regulations and conducting investigations and enforcement actions. The CPRA is set to become effective on January 1, 2023.",
        "Cybersecurity. The federal bank regulatory agencies have issued multiple statements regarding cybersecurity.  This guidance requires financial institutions to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials and include security measures to authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The management of a financial institution is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of operations in the event of a cyber-attack. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to a cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.",
        "State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states, notably including California where we conduct substantially all our banking business, have adopted laws and/or regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many such states (including California) have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue, and we continue to monitor relevant legislative and regulatory developments in California where nearly all our customers are located.",
        "In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. We employ a layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyber-attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. While to date we have not detected a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers.

Among the tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits.

The Corporation’s businesses compete with these other firms with respect to the range of products and services offered and the types of clients, customers and industries served.",
        " ",
        "The Corporation’s ability to compete effectively depends on the relative performance of its products, the degree to which the features of its products appeal to customers, and the extent to which the Corporation meets clients’ needs and expectations.

        "The Corporation encounters intense competition in attracting and retaining deposits and in its consumer and commercial lending activities. The Corporation competes for loans with other financial institutions, some of which are larger and have greater resources available than those of the Corporation. Management believes that the Corporation has been able to compete effectively for deposits and loans by offering a variety of account products and loans with competitive features, by pricing its products at competitive interest rates, by offering convenient branch locations, and by emphasizing the quality of its service. The Corporation’s ability to originate loans depends primarily on the rates and fees charged and the service it provides to its borrowers in making prompt credit decisions. There can be no assurance that in the future the Corporation will be able to continue to increase its deposit base or originate loans in the manner or on the terms on which it has done so in the past.",

These supervisory and regulatory requirements apply to all aspects of the Corporation’s and the Bank’s activities, including commercial and consumer lending, deposit taking, management, governance and other activities of the Corporation and the Bank. As part of this regulatory framework, the Corporation and the Bank are subject to extensive consumer financial regulatory legal and supervisory requirements. Further, U.S. financial supervision and regulation is dynamic in nature, and supervisory and regulatory requirements are subject to change as new legislative and regulatory actions are taken. Future legislation may increase the regulation and oversight of the Corporation and the Bank. Any change in applicable laws or regulations, however, may have a material adverse effect on the business of commercial banks and bank holding companies, including the Bank and the Corporation. ",

Under the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act, a bank holding company must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before it acquires direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of another bank, or merges or consolidates with another bank holding company. The Federal Reserve Board also has authority under certain circumstances to issue cease and desist orders, and assess substantial civil money penalties, against bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries. In addition, the Corporation is subject to ongoing regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board periodic and annual reports and other information concerning its own business operations and those of its subsidiaries.",

        "A bank holding company is prohibited under the Bank Holding Company Act, with limited exceptions, from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any business unrelated to the businesses of banking or managing or controlling banks. One of the exceptions to these prohibitions permits ownership by a bank holding company of the shares of any corporation if the Federal Reserve Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, by regulation or order has determined that the activities of the corporation in question are so closely related to the businesses of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

The Corporation elected to be a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act. Financial holding companies may engage, directly or indirectly, in any activity that is determined to be (i) financial in nature, (ii) incidental to such financial activity, or (iii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. The Bank Holding Company Act specifically provides that the following activities have been determined to be “financial in nature”: (a) lending, trust and other banking activities; (b) insurance activities; (c) financial or economic advice or services; (d) pooled investments; (e) securities underwriting and dealing; (f) domestic activities permitted for an existing bank holding company; (g) foreign activities permitted for an existing bank holding company; and (h) merchant banking activities.",

        "A financial holding company that ceases to meet certain standards is subject to a variety of restrictions, depending on the circumstances, including precluding the undertaking of new financial activities or the acquisition of shares or control of other companies. Until compliance is restored, the Federal Reserve Board has broad discretion to impose appropriate limitations on the financial holding company’s activities. If compliance is not restored within 180 days, the Federal Reserve Board may ultimately require the financial holding company to divest its depository institutions or, in the alternative, to discontinue or divest any activities that are not permitted to non-financial holding companies. The Corporation and FirstBank must be well-capitalized and well-managed for regulatory purposes, and FirstBank must earn “satisfactory” or better ratings on its periodic Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) examinations for the Corporation to preserve its financial holding company status.",

        "The potential restrictions are different if the lapse pertains to the CRA. In that case, until all the subsidiary institutions are restored to at least a “satisfactory” CRA rating status, the financial holding company may not engage, directly or through a subsidiary, in any new financial activities permissible under the Bank Holding Company Act or make additional acquisitions of companies engaged in new activities. However, the Bank Holding Company Act does not require divestiture of completed acquisitions and financial activities in which it has been engaged prior to such lapse.",
        "Under federal law and Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company such as the Corporation is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries and to commit required levels of support to them. This support may be required at times when, absent such policy, the bank holding company might not otherwise provide such support. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and be entitled to a priority of payment. ",

As of December 31, 2020, and the date hereof, FirstBank was and is the only depository institution subsidiary of the Corporation. Federal law directs the Federal Reserve Board to adopt regulations implementing the statutory source-of-strength requirements; however, such regulations have not yet been proposed.",
        "Regulatory Capital Requirements",
        "The federal banking agencies have implemented rules for U.S. banks that establish minimum regulatory capital requirements, the components of regulatory capital, and the risk-based capital treatment of bank assets and off-balance sheet exposures. These rules currently apply to the Corporation and FirstBank, generally are intended to align U.S. regulatory capital requirements with international regulatory capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”), in particular, the most recent international capital accord adopted in 2010 (and revised in 2011) known as “Basel III.” The current rules increase the quantity and quality of capital required by, among other things, establishing a minimum common equity capital requirement and an additional common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer. In addition, the current rules revise and harmonize the bank regulators’ rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and address weaknesses that have been identified, by applying a variation of the Basel III “Standardized Approach” for the risk-weighting of bank assets and off-balance sheet exposures to all U.S. banking organizations other than large internationally active banks.",
        "International regulatory developments also can affect the regulation and supervision of U.S. banking organizations, including the Corporation and FirstBank. Both the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board (established in April 2009 by the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors) have agreed to take action to strengthen regulation and supervision of the financial system with greater international consistency, cooperation, and transparency, including the adoption of Basel III and a commitment to raise capital standards and liquidity buffers within the banking system under Basel III. In addition, 12 U.S.C. 5371 (the “Collins Amendment”), among other things, eliminates certain trust-preferred securities (“TRuPs”) from Tier 1 capital. Preferred securities issued under the U.S. Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) are exempt from this change. Bank holding companies, such as the Corporation, were required to fully phase out these instruments from Tier 1 capital by January 1, 2016; however, these instruments may remain in Tier 2 capital until the instruments are redeemed or mature. As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $178.3 million in TRuPs that were subject to a full phase-out from Tier 1 capital under the final regulatory capital rules discussed above.",
        "Consistent with Basel Committee actions noted above, the Federal Reserve Board has adopted risk-based and leverage capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the Bank Holding Company Act. The historical risk-based capital guidelines were based upon the 1988 capital accord (“Basel I”) of the Basel Committee. These historical requirements, however, which included a legacy simplified risk-weighting system for the calculations of risk-based assets, as well as lower leverage capital requirements, were superseded by new risk-based and leverage capital requirements under Basel III that went into effect, on a multi-year transitional basis, on January 1, 2015. The FDIC has adopted substantively identical requirements that apply to insured banks under its regulation and supervision. The Corporation and FirstBank became subject to the U.S. Basel III capital rules beginning on January 1, 2015, and compute risk-weighted assets using the Standardized Approach required by these rules.",

        ", repurchases of capital instruments, dividends and interest payments on capital instruments) and (ii) discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and heads of major business lines.",
        " ",
        "Under the fully phased-in Basel III rules, in order to be considered adequately capitalized and not subject to the above-described limitations, the Corporation is required to maintain: (i) a minimum common equity Tier 1 Capital (“CET1”) to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 4.5%, plus the 2.5% “capital conservation buffer,” resulting in a required minimum CET1 ratio of at least 7%; (ii) a minimum ratio of total Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, resulting in a required minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%; (iii) a minimum ratio of total Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, resulting in a required minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%; and (iv) a required minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average on-balance sheet (non-risk adjusted) assets. ",
        " ",
        "The Basel III rules have increased our regulatory capital requirements and require us to hold more capital against certain of our assets and off-balance sheet exposures. The Corporation’s CET1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, total capital ratio, and the leverage ratio under the Basel III rules, as of December 31, 2020, were 17.31%, 17.61%, 20.37%, and 11.26%, respectively. ",
        "On July 9, 2019, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (collectively “the agencies”) adopted a final rule that superseded certain regulatory capital transition rules and eliminated the transition provisions that are no longer operative. The final rule was effective on April 1, 2020, and eliminated: (i) the 10% CET1 capital deduction threshold, which applies individually to holdings of mortgage servicing assets, temporary difference deferred tax assets, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock; (ii) the 15% CET1 capital deduction threshold, which applies to the aggregate amount of such items; (iii) the 10% threshold for non-significant investments, which applies to holdings of regulatory capital of unconsolidated financial institutions; and (iv) the deduction treatment for significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that are not in the form of common stock. Instead, the final rule requires non-advanced approaches banking organizations to deduct from CET1 capital any amount of mortgage servicing assets, temporary difference deferred tax assets, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that individually exceeds 25% of CET1 capital of the banking organization (the 25% CET1 capital deduction threshold). The final rule retains the requirement that increased from 100% to 250% the risk-weighting of non-deducted mortgage servicing assets and temporary difference deferred tax assets.",
        " ",
        "Further, as part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, on March 31, 2020, the agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The interim final rule provides that, at the election of a qualified banking organization, the initial impact of the adoption of CECL on retained earnings plus 25% of the change in the ACL (excluding PCD loans) from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021 will be delayed for two years and phased-in at 25% per year beginning on January 1, 2022 over a three-year period, resulting in a total transition period of five years. The Corporation and the Bank elected to phase in the full effect of CECL on regulatory capital over the five-year transition period.",
        " ",
        "The Corporation and FirstBank compute risk-weighted assets using the Standardized Approach required by the Basel III rules. The Standardized Approach for risk-weightings has expanded the risk-weighting categories from the four major risk-weighting categories under the previous regulatory capital rules (0%, 20%, 50%, and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets. In a number of cases, the Standardized Approach resulted in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. Specific changes to the risk-weightings of assets included, among other things: (i) applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans, (ii) assigning a 150% risk weight to exposures that are 90 days past due (other than qualifying residential mortgage exposures, which remain at an assigned risk-weighting of 100%), (iii) establishing a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable, in contrast to the 0% risk-weighting under the prior rules and (iv) requiring capital to be maintained against on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet exposures that result from certain cleared transactions, guarantees and credit derivatives, and collateralized transactions (such as repurchase agreement transactions).",

In general, among other changes, these regulations collectively: (i) require lenders to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a prospective residential mortgage borrower’s ability to repay based on specific underwriting criteria and set standards related to the determination by mortgage lenders of a consumer’s ability to repay the mortgage; (ii) require stricter underwriting of “qualified mortgages,” discussed below, that presumptively satisfy the ability to pay requirement (thereby providing the lender a safe harbor from non-compliance claims); (iii) specify new limitations on loan originator compensation and establish criteria for the qualifications of, and registration or licensing of, loan originators; (iv) expand the coverage of the Home Ownership and Equity Protections Act of 1994 to high-cost mortgage loans; (v) expand mandated loan escrow accounts for certain loans; (vi) establish appraisal requirements under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and require lenders to provide a free copy of all appraisals to applicants for first lien loans; (vii) establish appraisal standards for most “higher-risk mortgages” under TILA; (viii) combine in a single form required loan disclosures under TILA and RESPA; (ix) define a “qualified mortgage” ; and (x) afford safe harbor legal protections for lenders making qualified loans that are not “higher priced.”",

        "The CFPB also has issued regulations setting forth new mortgage servicing rules that apply to the Bank. The regulations affect notices given to consumers as to delinquency, foreclosure alternatives and loss mitigation, modification applications, interest rate adjustments and options for avoiding “force-placed” insurance. Servicers are prohibited from processing foreclosures when a loan modification is pending and must wait until a loan is more than 120 days delinquent before initiating a foreclosure action. The servicer must provide direct and ongoing access to its personnel, and provide prompt review of any loss mitigation application. Servicers must maintain accurate and accessible mortgage records for the life of a loan and until one year after the loan is paid off or transferred. The regulations also address matters such as force-placed insurance notices, policies and procedures, early intervention, loss mitigation requirements and periodic statement requirements under the CFPB mortgage servicing rules, servicing requirements when a consumer is a potential or confirmed successor-in-interest, is in bankruptcy, or sends a cease communication request under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act..

In addition to combining the existing disclosure requirements and implementing new requirements imposed by federal law, the rule provides extensive guidance regarding compliance with those requirements.",

In October 2020, the FDIC adopted revisions to its brokered deposit regulations that become effective on April 1, 2021, FirstBank is continuing its review and analysis of these changes, as adopted, although it appears that the revisions may, in some respects, expand the categories of deposits that FirstBank may accept without having to treat them as brokered deposits.",

        " In response to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 27, 2020, the U.S. Government enacted the CARES Act of 2020, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. The CARES Act of 2020, as amended, includes numerous provisions applicable to financial institutions, including (i) permitting banks to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19, provided that such loans were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, that would otherwise result in a loan’s classification as TDR or evaluation for impairment, until the earlier of 60 days after the termination date of the pandemic emergency or January 1, 2022, (ii) permitting borrowers whose loans are Federally backed to request a forbearance for up to 180 days, which can be extended for up to an additional 180 days at the borrower’s timely request, without incurring fees, penalties or interest beyond those the borrower would have incurred had the borrower made all scheduled payments, and without exposing the lender to adverse supervisory action, (iii) as discussed further above, permitting financial institutions that implement CECL during the 2020 calendar year the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL's effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period, and (iv) creation of the SBA PPP program under which small businesses may obtain loans guaranteed by the SBA to pay payroll and group health costs, salaries and commissions, mortgage and rent payments, utilities, and interest and other qualifying expenses. The SBA fully-guarantees SBA PPP loans, and SBA PPP loans may be forgiven by the SBA ",
        "so long as, during the applicable loan forgiveness covered period, employee and compensation levels of the business are maintained and 60% of the loan proceeds are used for payroll expenses, with the remaining 40% of the loan proceeds used for other qualifying expenses",
        ". SBA PPP loans carry an interest rate of 1% and have a two-year term (or five years for loans made after June 5, 2020). For loans originated under the SBA’s PPP loan program, interest and principal payment on these loans were originally deferred for six months following the funding date, during which time interest would continue to accrue. On October 7, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020 (the “Flexibility Act”) extended the deferral period for borrower payments of principal, interest, and fees on all SBA PPP loans to the date that the SBA remits the borrower’s loan forgiveness amount to the lender (or, if the borrower does not apply for loan forgiveness, 10 months after the end of the borrower’s loan forgiveness covered period). The extension of the deferral period under the Flexibility Act automatically applied to all SBA PPP loans. The Corporation has chosen to support its customers and the communities the Corporation serves by participating in the SBA PPP loan program and, loan modifications in compliance with the provisions of the CARES Act of 2020.

        "Main Street Lending Program",
        " The Main Street Lending Program (the “MSLP”) is designed to help companies that were in sound financial condition prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain their operations and payroll until conditions normalize. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston set up the Main Street special purpose vehicle (“Main Street SPV”) to work with the U.S. banking sector to channel credit to small and medium-sized businesses across the country. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has made a $75 billion equity investment in the Main Street SPV, which will support up to $600 billion of lending. Main Street loans are to be made by private financial institutions, which will then sell a 95% participation in each loan to the Main Street SPV pursuant to certain participation-specific documents. The MSLP offers three different secured or unsecured five-year term loan options set at an adjustable rate of LIBOR (one or three month) plus 300 basis points. The MSLP, however, terminated on January 8, 2021.",
        " MSLP principal payments are deferred for two years, and interest payments are deferred for one year. However, unlike PPP loans, Main Street loans are full-recourse loans and not forgivable; the Federal Reserve Board and other governmental entities have expressed in no uncertain terms that loans under the MSLP are not grants.",
        " COVID-Related Regulatory Activities",
        " During 2020, the federal banking agencies took several actions to mitigate the stress on regulated banks resulting from the COVID pandemic. These actions were generally designed to facilitate the ability of banks to provide responsible credit and liquidity to businesses and individuals affected by the COVID pandemic, and mitigate the distorting effects under regulatory capital and other requirements resulting from the pandemic. In addition to the CECL regulatory capital relief discussed above, the banking agencies adopted regulations that, among other things: neutralized the regulatory capital and liquidity effects of banks participating in certain COVID-related Federal Reserve liquidity facilities; deferred appraisal and valuation requirements after the closing of certain residential and commercial real estate transactions; provided temporary relief for banks from the FDIC’s audit and reporting requirements for banks that experienced large cash inflows resulting from participation in the Paycheck Protection Program and other COVID-related facilities, or otherwise resulting from the effects of government stimulus efforts. These regulatory actions were taken in conjunction with federal financial regulatory efforts to encourage banks and other depositories to provide responsible credit and other financial assistance to consumers and small businesses in response to the pandemic.

        "Risks Related to Our Industry",
        "We earn substantially all of our revenue based on assets under management and, therefore, a reduction in assets under management would reduce our revenues and profitability. Assets under management fluctuate based on many factors including market conditions, investment performance, and terminations of investment contracts.",
        "Substantially all of our revenues are directly related to the amount of our AUM. Under our investment advisory contracts with our clients, the investment advisory fees we receive are typically based on the market value of AUM. In addition, we receive asset-based distribution fees with respect to the open-end Funds managed by Gabelli Funds or Teton and its affiliates over time pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of Rule 12b-1 under the Company Act. Rule 12b-1 fees typically are based on the average AUM and represented approximately 8.9% and 9.4% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, a decline in the prices of securities generally may cause our revenues and net income to decline by either causing the value of our AUM to decrease, which would result in lower investment advisory and Rule 12b-1 fees, or causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments they perceive to offer greater opportunity or lower risk, which would also result in lower fees. The securities markets are highly volatile, and securities prices may decrease for many reasons beyond our control, including, but not limited to, economic and political events, war (whether or not directly involving the U.S.), acts of terrorism, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, the yield curve, defaults by derivative counterparties, bond default risks, sovereign debt crisis, and other factors that are difficult or impossible to predict. If a decline in securities prices caused our revenues to decline, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. Lastly, as we are a traditional asset manager, we do not receive additional revenue streams from alternative asset strategies such as hedge funds, private equity, or venture capital.",

The Funds managed by Gabelli Funds are registered with the SEC as investment companies under the Company Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on investment advisors, including record-keeping, advertising and operating requirements, fiduciary and disclosure obligations, custodial requirements, and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Company Act imposes similar obligations, as well as additional detailed operational requirements, on registered investment companies and investment advisors. In addition, our businesses are also subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom, and we are also subject to the laws of other non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies or bodies.",
        "Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, censure, suspensions of teammates, or other sanctions, including revocation of our subsidiaries’ registrations as an investment advisor or broker-dealer. Industry regulations are designed to protect our clients and investors in our funds and other third parties who deal with us and to ensure the integrity of the financial markets. Our industry is frequently altered by new laws or regulations and by revisions to, and evolving interpretations of, existing laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and in other nations.

        "Events outside of our control, including public health crises, could negatively affect the portfolios we manage and our results of our operations.",
        "Periods of market volatility have occurred and could continue to occur in response to pandemics or other events outside of our control. These types of events have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect operating results for us and the portfolios that we manage. For example, in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) surfaced in China and has since spread quickly to other countries, including the U.S., which has resulted in restrictions on travel and congregation and the temporary closure of many non-essential businesses in affected jurisdictions, including, beginning in March 2020, in the U.S. In addition to these developments having adverse consequences for us and the portfolios that we manage, the operations of GAMCO could be adversely impacted, including through quarantine measures and travel restrictions imposed on its personnel or service providers based in affected countries, or any related health issues of such personnel or service providers. As the potential impact of COVID-19 is difficult to predict, the extent to which COVID-19 could negatively affect our and our portfolio companies’ operating results or the duration of any potential business disruption is uncertain. Any potential impact to our results of operations will depend to a large extent on future developments and new information that could emerge regarding the duration and severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control. These potential impacts, while uncertain, could adversely affect our operating results.",
        "To the extent we are forced to compete on the basis of price, we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure.",
        "The investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. To the extent we are forced to compete on the basis of price, we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure. Although our investment advisory fees vary from product to product, historically we have competed primarily on the performance of our products and not on the level of our investment advisory fees relative to those of our competitors. In recent years, however, there has been a trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry. In order to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment, we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and service that make investors willing to pay our fees. In addition, the board of directors or trustees of each Fund managed by Gabelli Funds must make certain findings as to the reasonableness of its fees. We cannot be assured that we will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or new business could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.",
        "We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from investment advisory contracts that may be terminated on short notice or may not be renewed by clients.",
        "A substantial majority of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements and distribution arrangements. Investment management agreements and distribution arrangements with the domestic Funds are terminable without penalty on 60 days’ notice (subject to certain additional procedural requirements in the case of termination by a Fund) and must be specifically approved at least annually, as required by law. Such annual renewal requires, among other things, approval by the disinterested members of each Fund’s board of directors or trustees. Investment advisory agreements with our Institutional and PWM clients are typically terminable by the client without penalty on 30 days’ notice or less. Any failure to renew or termination of a significant number of these agreements or arrangements would have a material adverse effect on us.",

        "Open-end Fund investors may redeem their investments in those Funds at any time without prior notice. Investors may reduce the aggregate amount of AUM for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, and financial market performance. In a declining stock market, the pace of mutual fund redemptions could accelerate. Poor performance relative to other asset management firms tends to result in decreased purchases of open-end fund shares and increased redemptions of open-end fund shares. The redemption of investments in the Funds managed by Gabelli Funds would adversely affect our revenues, which are substantially dependent upon the AUM in our Funds. If redemptions of investments in the open-end Funds caused our revenues to decline, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.",
        "Certain changes in control of our company would automatically terminate our investment management agreements with our clients, unless our Institutional and PWM clients consent and, in the case of Fund clients, the Funds’ boards of directors and shareholders vote to continue the agreements, and could prevent us for a two-year period from increasing the investment advisory fees we are able to charge our mutual fund clients.",
        "Under the Company Act, an investment management agreement with a fund must provide for its automatic termination in the event of its assignment. The fund’s board and shareholders must vote to continue the agreement following its assignment, the cost of which ordinarily would be borne by us. Under the Advisers Act, a client’s investment management agreement may not be assigned by the investment advisor without the client’s consent. An investment management agreement is considered to be assigned to another party when a controlling block of the advisor’s ownership is transferred. In our case, an assignment of our investment management agreements may occur if, among other things, we sell or issue a certain number of additional common shares in the future. We cannot be certain that our clients will consent to assignments of our investment management agreements or approve new agreements with us if an assignment occurs. Under the Company Act, if a fund’s investment advisor engages in a transaction that results in the assignment of its investment management agreement with the fund, the advisor may not impose an unfair burden on that fund as a result of the transaction for a two-year period after the transaction is completed. The term “unfair burden” has been interpreted to include certain increases in investment advisory fees. This restriction may discourage potential purchasers from acquiring a controlling interest in our company.",

        "We have a disaster recovery plan to address certain contingencies, but it cannot be assured that this plan will be effective or sufficient in responding to, eliminating, or ameliorating the effects of all disaster scenarios. If our teammates or vendors we rely upon for support in a catastrophic event are unable to respond adequately or in a timely manner, we may lose clients resulting in a decrease in AUM, which may have a material adverse effect on revenues and net income.",

        "Since our IPO in 1999, Mr. Gabelli, through his control and majority ownership of GGCP, has beneficially owned a majority of our outstanding Class B Stock, currently representing approximately 92% of voting control. As long as Mr. Gabelli indirectly beneficially owns a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, he will have the ability to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors and thereby control our management and affairs, including determinations with respect to acquisitions, dispositions, borrowings, issuances of common stock or other securities, and the declaration and payment of dividends on the common stock. In addition, Mr. Gabelli will be able to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders for approval and will be able to cause or prevent a change in control of our company. As a result of Mr. Gabelli’s control, none of our agreements with Mr. Gabelli and other companies controlled by him can be assumed to have been arrived at through arm’s-length negotiations, although we believe that the parties endeavor to implement market-based terms.

The market for qualified portfolio managers is extremely competitive. We anticipate that it will be necessary for us to add portfolio managers and investment analysts as we further diversify our investment products and strategies. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain teammates. In addition, our investment professionals and senior marketing teammates have direct contact with our Institutional and PWM clients, which can lead to strong client relationships. The loss of these teammates could jeopardize our relationships with certain Institutional and PWM clients, and result in the loss of such accounts. The loss of key management professionals or the inability to recruit and retain sufficient portfolio managers and marketing teammates could have a material adverse effect on our business.",
        "There may be adverse effects on our business from a decline in the performance of the securities markets.",

The securities markets in general have experienced significant volatility, and such volatility may continue or increase in the future. At December 31, 2020, approximately 93% of our AUM was invested in portfolios consisting primarily of equity securities. Any decline in the securities markets, in general, and the equity markets, in particular, could reduce our AUM and consequently reduce our revenues. In addition, any such decline in the equity markets, failure of these markets to sustain their prior levels of growth, or continued short-term volatility in these markets could result in investors withdrawing from the equity markets or decreasing their rate of investment, either of which would be likely to adversely affect us. Also, from time to time, a relatively high proportion of the assets we manage may be concentrated in particular economic or industry sectors. A general decline in the performance of securities in those industry sectors could have an adverse effect on our AUM and revenues.",

        "Future investment performance could reduce revenues and other income.",
        "Success in the investment management and mutual fund businesses is dependent on investment performance as well as distribution and client servicing. Good performance generally stimulates sales of our investment products and tends to keep withdrawals and redemptions low, which generates higher advisory fees (which are based on the amount of AUM). Conversely, poor performance, both in absolute terms and/or relative to peers and industry benchmarks, tends to result in decreased sales, increased withdrawals and redemptions in the case of the open-end Funds, and in the loss of Institutional and PWM clients, with corresponding decreases in revenues to us. Many analysts of the mutual fund industry believe that investment performance is the most important factor for the growth of open-end and closed-end funds, such as those we offer. Failure of our investment products to perform well or failure of the Funds to maintain ratings or rankings could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on us.",
        "In addition, when our investment products experience strong results relative to the market or other asset classes, clients’ investments in our products may increase beyond their target levels, and we could, therefore, suffer withdrawals as our clients rebalance their investments to fit their asset allocation preferences.",

Account turnover for any reason would have an adverse effect on our revenues.

        "Market conditions may preclude us from increasing the assets we manage in our closed-end Funds. A significant portion of our growth in the assets we manage resulted from public offerings of the common and preferred shares of the closed-end Funds. We raised approximately $6.2 billion in gross assets through closed-end Fund offerings since January 2004. The market conditions for these offerings may not be as favorable in the future, which could adversely impact our ability to grow our AUM and our revenue.",

        "A significant share of sales of our open-end Funds come through third party distribution programs, which are programs sponsored by third party intermediaries that offer their mutual fund customers a variety of competing products and administrative services. A substantial component of sales growth is from third party distribution programs with no transaction fees payable by the customer, which we refer to as NTF programs. Approximately $2.5 billion of our AUM in the open-end equity Funds as of December 31, 2020 are held through NTF programs. The cost of participating in third party distribution programs is higher than our direct distribution costs, and it is anticipated that the cost of third party distribution programs will increase in the future. Any increase would be likely to have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the third party distribution programs will continue to distribute the Funds on their platforms. Consolidation may result in the reduction of distributors or increased competition to access third party channels, as well as increased distribution costs. At December 31, 2020, approximately 91% of the NTF program net assets in the Gabelli/GAMCO families of Funds are attributable to two NTF programs. The decision by these third party distribution programs to discontinue distribution of our Funds, or a decision by us to withdraw one or more of the Funds from the programs, could have an adverse effect on our growth of AUM.",

Consequently, we rely heavily on our financial, accounting, and other data processing systems. Despite the reliability of these systems, and the training and skill of our teammates and third parties we rely on, it remains likely that errors may occasionally occur due to the extremely large number of transactions we process. In addition, if systems we use are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions, our ability to expand our businesses could be constrained.

The plans are reviewed for effectiveness biannually and are communicated to affected employees through safety meetings and training. Drills and emergency exercises are conducted to ensure all employees understand their roles and responsibilities during an actual event. These exercises range from tabletop exercises to internal drills, up to and including events involving external resources. CNX works hand-in-hand with local municipalities and emergency responders to ensure they are fluent in our plan and procedures. CNX provides emergency responder training to volunteer fire departments, and county emergency management, including tours of various phases of operation they may encounter during an event. This helps to familiarize emergency response resources with CNX personnel, facilities and operations. This proactive approach gives emergency responders the opportunity to ask questions and understand CNX protocols so they are prepared in the case of an emergency. "

To support our workforce, we introduced new collaboration tools and techniques and instituted a productivity reimbursement program to assist all employees with purchasing equipment to better enable remote work. We expanded our wellness programs to offer courses on, among other things, caregiving during the pandemic and vaccine information; provided employees with licenses to a digital health platform; and developed manager guidance on enabling flexible work arrangements. We also provided four paid wellness days in 2020 to allow additional paid time off for employees, specifically to encourage mental and physical health. Health and safety protocols have been adopted in all of our offices to protect the well-being of those employees who need to access an Akamai location in person.

All qualified applicants for employment with us receive consideration for employment, and we do not tolerate discrimination on the basis of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race or ethnicity, protected veteran status, disability or other protected group status. Akamai supports varied programs and practices designed to promote a diverse and inclusive working environment. We have eleven employee resource groups, or ERGs, that offer opportunities for groups of employees to come together for mutual support, education and development. ERGs encompass different racial and ethnic groups, persons with different physical abilities, parents, military veterans, those supporting the LGBTQ community and women. We track the diversity of our workforce and report quarterly to the board of directors on our progress to improve our diverse representation. At December 31, 2020, global female representation was 26.2%, up from 25.8% at the end of 2019, and racial and ethnic minority representation in the U.S. was 40.6%, up from 39.6% at the end of 2019. To help us improve the diversity of our workforce, we participate in or sponsor professional development and recruiting forums such as the Massachusetts Conference for Women, National Society of Black Engineers, Society of Hispanic Engineers and Hack.Diversity. We also offer the Akamai Technical Academy, a technical training program for diverse individuals (gender, ethnicity, experiential, generational, veterans) who are interested in pursuing a technical career path, but may not be formally educated in science, mathematics or engineering. The program consists of Akamai-specific classroom training, after which participants are placed in a variety of contract roles across our  organization with the potential to become full time employees. We also train hiring managers to draft inclusive job descriptions intended to broaden the pool of eligible applicants.",

Our compensation and benefits philosophy is to maximize the effectiveness of pay and benefits programs to attract and retain the high caliber individuals needed to drive the success of our business, while balancing cost-effectiveness and competitive factors. Our benefits programs (which vary by country and region) include healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, adoption and fertility assistance, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance and holistic wellness programs. Our wellness programs include educational offerings on healthy lifestyles, access to mental health experts and access to ergonomic advice and equipment. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with shareholders, restricted stock units are provided to eligible employees under our broad-based stock incentive programs, and most employees are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan.",

Our average revenue per front-office employee has historically declined year-over-year for the period immediately following significant headcount increases, and the additional brokers and salespeople generally achieve significantly higher productivity levels in their second or third year with the Company. Further, because revenue per broker is not a widely used or relevant statistic for the insurance brokerage industry, we do not commonly provide revenue statistics with respect to front-office staff for our insurance brokerage business. Excluding our insurance brokerage business, as of December 31, 2020, our front-office headcount was 2,297 brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel, down 10.7% from 2,573 a year ago.

For example, in our Fenics businesses, we aim to convert Voice and Hybrid trading to Fully Electronic trading in order to improve our margins. This is largely because automated and electronic trading efficiency allows the same number of employees to manage a greater volume of trades resulting in a decrease in the marginal cost of trading. Our Fully Electronic business has generally overcome challenges associated with remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic and productivity has remained high with revenue growth of 14.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.

On November 23, 2018, those shares of BGC Class A common stock were converted into 10,000,000 shares of BGC Class B common stock and remain pledged in connection with the partner loan program. On November 23, 2018, BGC Partners issued 10,323,366 shares of BGC Class B common stock to Cantor and 712,907 shares of BGC Class B common stock to CFGM, an affiliate of Cantor, in each case in exchange for shares of BGC Class A common stock from Cantor and CFGM, respectively, on a one-to-one basis pursuant to Cantor’s and CFGM’s right to exchange such shares under the letter agreement, dated as of June 5, 2015, by and between BGC Partners and Cantor. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, no additional consideration was paid to BGC Partners by Cantor or CFGM for the Class B Issuance. The Class B Issuance was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2020, Cantor and CFGM did not own any shares of BGC Class A common stock. Each share of BGC Class A common stock is entitled to one vote on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. ",
        "In addition, as of December 31, 2020, Cantor and CFGM held 45,884,380 shares of BGC Class B common stock (which represents all of the outstanding shares of BGC Class B common stock), representing approximately 58.7% of our voting power on such date. Each share of BGC Class B common stock is generally entitled to the same rights as a share of BGC Class A common stock, except that, on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes.

The limited partnership interests of the two operating partnerships are held by us and BGC Holdings, and the limited partnership interests of BGC Holdings are currently held by LPU holders, Founding Partners, and Cantor. We hold the BGC Holdings general partnership interest and the BGC Holdings special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle us to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC Holdings, and serve as the general partner of BGC Holdings, which entitles us to control BGC Holdings. BGC Holdings, in turn, holds the BGC U.S. OpCo general partnership interest and the BGC U.S. OpCo special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle the holder thereof to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC U.S. OpCo, and the BGC Global OpCo general partnership interest and the BGC Global OpCo special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle the holder thereof to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC Global OpCo, and serves as the general partner of BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo, all of which entitle BGC Holdings (and thereby us) to control each of BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo. BGC Holdings holds its BGC Global OpCo general partnership interest through a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, BGC Global Holdings GP Limited.",

As of that date, BGC Holdings held 166,877,100 BGC U.S. OpCo limited partnership units and 166,877,100 BGC Global OpCo limited partnership units, representing approximately 31.1% of the outstanding limited partnership units in both BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo.

Since BGC Holdings in turn holds BGC U.S. OpCo limited partnership interests and BGC Global OpCo limited partnership interests, LPU holders, Founding Partners, and Cantor indirectly have interests in BGC U.S. OpCo limited partnership interests and BGC Global OpCo limited partnership interests. Further, in connection with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings were distributed to the holders of limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings, whereby each holder of BGC Holdings limited partnership interests who at that time held a BGC Holdings limited partnership interest received a corresponding Newmark Holdings limited partnership interest, equal in number to a BGC Holdings limited partnership interest divided by 2.2 (i.e., 0.4545 of a unit in Newmark Holdings). Accordingly, existing partners at the time of the Separation in BGC Holdings are also partners in Newmark Holdings and hold corresponding units issued at the applicable ratio.

Moreover, safety measurements are integrated into the performance evaluations of our Executives, proving our dedication to the health and safety of our employees. We emphasize safe behavior and encourage suggestions, ideas, and observations from our workforce. We have implemented a “safety moment” process, which increases employee awareness to workplace and day-to-day hazards while delivering key messages to reduce or minimize the risk of those hazards causing injury. We strive to begin each meeting with a safety moment, and some of our facilities have reserved time each week for a safety moment. Additional safety efforts include: monthly safety meetings with all employees, safety audits by management, safety audits by selected employees, and the inclusion of safety initiatives as part of select employees' incentive plans. Through these safety efforts, many of our facilities' safety records have improved year-over-year. The Company utilizes a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the health and safety performance of its operations. Lagging indicators include the OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate (\"TRIR\") and the Lost Time Accidents (“LTA”). Leading indicators include reporting and closure of all near miss events and safety concerns identified. Reported total workforce numbers include employees and supervised contractors. In fiscal year 2020, the Company had a TRIR of 1.85, an LTA of 8 and 0 work-related fatalities",

Luxfer offers several health and wellness benefits that encourage employees to improve their personal health. For example, we implemented a smoking cessation program in the US, under which employees who successfully complete the 90-day program are rewarded with discounted insurance rates. We also implemented the Luxfer Employee Healthy Lifestyle program in the US, which will soon be available to all Luxfer employees worldwide. The purpose of the program is to encourage employees to take steps towards improving their health by offering some reimbursement for certain gym/fitness center memberships and for weight loss programs/group exercise classes. Furthermore, we provide access to wellness clinics and funded counseling sessions to improve our employees’ physical and mental health. Health and wellness information is regularly provided to our employees through notices posted in readily accessible areas and in our company newsletters to ensure that every employee has an opportunity to take advantage of these benefits.

Written in 1986, in preparation for our initial public offering, the Markel Style memorialized how we seek to operate our businesses and treat one another. It continues to provide our guiding principles across our diverse group of businesses. Key within the Markel Style is the encouragement to look for a better way to do things, to challenge management. We also seek spontaneity and flexibility and a respect for authority, but disdain for bureaucracy. Our diverse financial holding company is managed in a way to accomplish these principles. Each of our businesses operates with a high degree of autonomy so long as they operate within the principles of the Markel Style. This allows our managers to make decisions that are best for their employees and customers, as well as our shareholders. We believe this high degree of empowerment leads to the satisfaction that comes from being trusted in the responsibilities one has been given.",

In addition, every two years we conduct a major, global employee engagement survey across our insurance operations, which historically has garnered more than 80% participation, and which enables us to identify, focus on and track progress against key engagement drivers. This survey has generated additional ideas for employee engagement; and we have made substantial changes and improvements in our human capital practices based on this feedback. ",
