        "Our employees are critical to our success. We attract, develop, and retain employee talent by offering competitive compensation packages and fostering a culture of care about their well being. As such, we strive to make the safety of our workforce our highest priority as evidenced by our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we focus on protecting the health and safety of our employees and establishing a safe work environment by following the COVID-19 safety recommendations issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at all of our facilities.",
        "In addition, we endeavor to be a proactive corporate citizen by being responsive and supportive of the needs of our employees to attract qualified talent. We strive to provide opportunities for qualified members of underrepresented communities and women for advancement within our company and award scholarships to the children and grandchildren of our employees so that they may develop the skills that will support their entry into the workforce. In addition, in 2018, we implemented an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) to provide employees the opportunity to share in the ownership of our company and benefit from our performance through the purchase of our company’s stock. The ESPP allows eligible employees to accumulate contributions through after-tax payroll deductions to purchase shares of our company’s stock at a 15% discount and serves as a key retention mechanism for our human capital.",
        "As of December31, 2020, we employed 2,450 people, of which 445 are subject to collective bargaining agreements expiring in June 2021 and April 2022. We believe our relations with our employees are good. See Risk Factors contained within Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding certain risks related to our employees.",
