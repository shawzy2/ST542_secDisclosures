        "\nAs of December 31, 2020, Havertys’ total workforce was 2,766: 1,534 in our retail store operations, 992 in our warehouse and delivery points, 173 in our corporate operations, and 67 in our customer-service call centers. None of our team members is a party to a union contract. See Management’s Discussion & Analysis – Impact of COVID-19 for more information.\n\nHealth and Safety\nWe were a leader in our industry as we closed our retail stores and paused distribution operations in mid-March to help protect the health and safety of our team members. Since reopening in May, we are carefully following CDC guidelines and have established a number of safety protocols, including face covering and physical distance requirements, enhanced cleaning, encouraging daily self-health checks, voluntary temperature screening stations, and access to virtual primary care physicians at no cost. We also have a multi-disciplinary team coordinating responses to COVID-19 tests due to illness or exposure and positive COVID-19 tests. As part of that process, we have developed a robust contact tracing program to identify team members who were in close contact with an ill colleague in the workplace.\n\nWe care about our teammates, customers, and the communities we serve. We have a strong safety program that focuses on implementing policies and training programs to ensure our team members can leave their job and return home safely, every day. This focus has resulted in a reduction of our frequency of injury claims of 43.4% over five years (2016 – 2020) and our self-insured loss rates are down 38.2% over the same period. This commitment and focus have enabled us to restart our business operations without sacrificing the safety of our teammates and customers.\n\nDiversity\nIntegrity and teamwork are two of our core values. These drive our approach in our everyday operations with our customers, suppliers and teammates and we believe that the best results happen when we work together. At Havertys, we see strength in America's many faces, cultures, and colors. Each person offers a unique point of view and presents a fresh perspective. We are committed to diverse representation across all levels of our workforce to reflect the vibrant and thriving diversity of the communities in which we live and work.\n\nRetention\nOur compensation programs are designed to attract, retain, and motivate team members to achieve superior results. Havertys’ total compensation for teammates includes a variety of components including competitive pay consistent with positions, skill levels, experience, and knowledge. We also offer competitive benefits, including access to healthcare plans, financial and physical wellness programs, paid time off, parental leave and retirement benefits.\n\nWe are committed to supporting our teammates’ continuous development of professional, technical and leadership skills through corporate training programs, access to digital learning resources and through partnerships with local technical learning institutions. In 2020, Havertys team members consumed approximately 119,000 hours of learning. We also offer the ability for team members to pursue degree programs, professional certificates, and individual courses in strategic fields of study through our tuition reimbursement program.\n\n",
