        "In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our human capital management.  Of our nearly 1,000 office locations, nearly 400 are open, but most of those at reduced capacity. Accordingly, the vast majority of our employees continue to work remotely for some or all of their work week.  We have instituted safety protocols and procedures for employees when they are in an office and have not had any office-wide outbreaks of COVID-19.",
        "As of December 31, 2020, we had 32,401 employees, with approximately 50% in the U.S. and 50% outside of the U.S.Approximately 76% of our employees work in our brokerage segment and 20% in our risk management segment.  Our remaining employees work in our corporate segment, primarily in our home office and financial services division, as well as in our service centers in India and elsewhere around the world.In 2020, our total compensation expense was $2,882.5 million for the brokerage segment and $517.5million for the risk management segment, representing 55.8% and 63.0%, respectively, of brokerage and risk management segment revenues.  Additional information regarding compensation expense, both on a reported and an adjusted basis, can be found elsewhere in this report under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ",
        "While many of our new employees come to us through mergers and acquisitions and traditional hiring, “growing our own” has long been a key part of our human capital strategy.  Our summer internship program began more than fifty years ago with a single intern.  Since then, our program has grown globally and we employed more than 400 interns each summer in 2018 and 2019 (we had fewer interns in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic).  We provide our interns with professional development and on-the-job sales training that gives them the opportunity to cultivate expertise and accelerate their full-time sales career growth.",
        "As of December 31, 2020, approximately 59.8% of our employees were women, including 47.3% of managers and 40.2% of producers.  In the U.S., approximately 23.6% of our employees were racially/ethnically diverse, including 14.4% of managers and 18.9% of producers."
