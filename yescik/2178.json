        "Our business strategy and ability to serve customers relies on employing talented professionals and attracting, training, developing and retaining a skilled workforce.  There is substantial competition for qualified truck drivers in the trucking industry.  Recruitment, training, and retention of a professional driver workforce is essential to our continued growth and fulfillment of customer needs.  We hire qualified professional drivers who hold a valid commercial driver’s license, satisfy applicable federal and state safety performance and measurement requirements, and meet our hiring criteria.  These guidelines relate primarily to safety history, road test evaluations, and various other evaluations, which include physical examinations and mandatory drug and alcohol testing.  We provide comfortable, late model equipment, encourage direct communication with management, and pay competitive wages and benefits, and other incentives intended to encourage driver safety, retention and long-term employment.  Prior to being released for individual duty, each new hire is required to undergo a mandatory training and evaluation period by a certified driver trainer/instructor.  The length of this training period will be dependent on experience and the new hire adaptation to company policies and procedures.",
