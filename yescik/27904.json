        "We believe that Delta people are our strongest competitive advantage, and the high-quality service that they provide sets us apart from other airlines. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 74,000 people, of which approximately 72,000 were based in the U.S. In 2020, the dedication and determination of Delta people in response to the unprecedented challenges we faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic enabled us to avoid involuntary furloughs of U.S. employees, with approximately 50,000",
        "employees volunteering to take unpaid leaves of absence, approximately 18,000 employees participating in early retirement and voluntary separation programs and from April 1 through December 31, 2020, most employees working reduced hours",
        "Our principal human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop people who understand and are committed to delivering the “Delta Difference” that is core to our brand. To support these objectives, our human resources programs seek to",
        "Prepare our employees for key roles and future leadership positions through a variety of training and development programs",
        "Reward our people through highly competitive total compensation and benefit programs designed to share our success, promote teamwork and support our people’s total wellbeing",
        "Enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making our workplace more engaging, equitable and inclusive",
        "Drive employees’ professional and community engagement",
        "The health and safety of our employees is foundational to achieving these objectives. We have long led the airline industry in employee safety and seek to achieve world-class personal safety performance",
        "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we created pay protection programs for employees with symptoms, diagnosed, exposed or at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and established a notification process for potential COVID-19 exposure. We also assembled a COVID-19 task force to develop a series of safety measures in an effort to protect our employees and customers, including offering on-site rapid COVID-19 testing in most locations and making at-home testing available for all U.S.-based employees, and offering a return-to-work safety training program",
        "Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is also critical to effective human capital management at Delta. As a global airline, we are in the business of bringing people together, and we believe our business should reflect the diversity of our customer base. To achieve this goal, we seek diverse talent internally and externally in an effort to achieve broader diverse representation throughout our organization. We also promote inclusion through education, training and development opportunities as well as by leveraging insights from our business resource groups, of which approximately one-third of our employees were members as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we intend to drive accountability for equitable outcomes by reviewing and revising systems, practices and policies and measuring inclusive behaviors, practices and representation. Two key areas on which we are focused are (1) reinforcement of our diverse talent pipeline by, among other things, requiring hiring candidate slates and interview panels to reflect diversity and giving equal consideration for accessible experience or certifications in an effort to remove unnecessary barriers, like college degrees, to certain roles and (2) closing diversity gaps in senior leadership positions by increasing the representation of minority and female officers, including doubling the number of black officers by 2025",
