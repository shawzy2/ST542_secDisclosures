        "Culture and Engagement. The Company recognizes the importance of employee engagement and inclusion and has implemented a regular process of surveying its employees to obtain their feedback on both what is working well and areas of improvement. The main take-aways from the initial survey was that Company employees are committed to safety, understand the Company’s strategic direction, and believe the Company’s overall focus is on the customer. Employees voiced their desire to see more opportunity for community involvement and communication from senior management. This feedback led to specific initiatives including an increased use of town halls both in person and virtual and the establishment of an employee led community involvement committee for 2021. Another initiative developed following the Company’s culture survey was the development of the Company’s core values. The core values are a product of a cross functional team that used the employee responses from the culture survey to reflect the common values of the Company. The core values are principles that are communicated and owned throughout the organization. ",
        "Diversity. The Company has a diversity committee whose purpose is to continuously improve its diversity of employees.

        "Marine Transportation Segment Risk Factors",
        "The Inland Waterway infrastructure is aging and may result in increased costs and disruptions to the Company’s marine transportation segment. Maintenance of the United States inland waterway system is vital to the Company’s operations. The system is composed of over 12,000 miles of commercially navigable waterway, supported by over 240 locks and dams designed to provide flood control, maintain pool levels of water in certain areas of the country and facilitate navigation on the inland river system. The United States inland waterway infrastructure is aging, with more than half of the locks over 50 years old. As a result, due to the age of the locks, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance outages may be more frequent in nature, resulting in delays and additional operating expenses. One-half of the cost of new construction and major rehabilitation of locks and dams is paid by marine transportation companies through a 29 cent per gallon diesel fuel tax and the remaining 50% of waterway infrastructure and improvement is paid from general federal tax revenues. Failure of the federal government to adequately fund infrastructure maintenance and improvements in the future would have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to deliver products for its customers on a timely basis. In addition, any additional user taxes that may be imposed in the future to fund infrastructure improvements would increase the Company’s operating expenses.",
        "The Company could be adversely impacted by a marine accident or spill event. A marine accident or spill event could close a portion of the inland waterway system or a coastal area of the United States for an extended period of time. Although statistically marine transportation is the safest means of surface transportation of bulk commodities, accidents do occur, both involving Company equipment and equipment owned by other marine operators.",
        "The Company transports a wide variety of petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals throughout the Mississippi River System, on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, coastwise along all three United States coasts and in Alaska and Hawaii. The Company manages its exposure to losses from potential unauthorized discharges of pollutants through the use of well-maintained and equipped tank barges and towing vessels, through safety, training and environmental programs, and through the Company’s insurance program, but a discharge of pollutants by the Company could have an adverse effect on the Company. Risks may arise for which the Company may not be insured. Claims covered by insurance are subject to deductibles, the aggregate amount of which could be material, and certain policies impose limitations on coverage. Existing insurance coverage may not be able to be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or coverage capacity for certain risks may not be available or adequate to cover future claims. If a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured, or the carrier is unable or unwilling to cover the claim, the Company could be exposed to liability.",
        "The Company’s marine transportation segment is dependent on its ability to adequately crew its towing vessels. The Company’s vessels are crewed with employees who are licensed or certified by the USCG, including its captains, pilots, engineers and tankermen. The success of the Company’s marine transportation segment is dependent on the Company’s ability to adequately crew its vessels. As a result, the Company invests significant resources in training its crews and providing crew members an opportunity to advance from a deckhand to the captain of a Company towboat or tugboat. Inland crew members generally work rotations such as 20 days on, 10 days off rotation, or a 30 days on, 15 days off rotation. For the coastal fleet, crew members are generally required to work rotations such as 14 days on, 14 days off rotation, a 21 days on, 21 days off rotation or a 30 days on, 30 days off rotation, dependent upon the location. The nature of crewmember work schedules and assignments away from home for extended periods require special recruiting and at times it can be difficult to find candidates. With ongoing retirements and competitive labor pressure in the marine transportation segment, the Company continues to monitor and implement market competitive pay practices. The Company also utilizes an internal development program to train Maritime Academy graduates for vessel leadership positions.",

The segment’s coastal operations include approximately 600 vessel employees, of whom approximately 375 are subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain geographic areas. Any work stoppages or labor disputes could adversely affect coastal operations in those areas. To date, the Company has been able to manage crewing of its vessels despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with only minimal vessel delays and disruption of services, but with some loss of revenue which have primarily impacted our offshore vessels. The Company continues to update its processes relating to management of COVID-19 and provide related employee education as new information and guidance becomes available.",
        "The Company’s marine transportation segment is subject to the Jones Act. The Company’s marine transportation segment competes principally in markets subject to the Jones Act, a federal cabotage law that restricts domestic marine transportation in the United States to vessels built and registered in the United States, and manned, owned and operated by United States citizens. The Company presently meets all of the requirements of the Jones Act for its owned and operated vessels. The loss of Jones Act status could have a significant negative effect on the Company. The requirements that the Company’s vessels be United States built and manned by United States citizens, the crewing requirements and material requirements of the USCG, and the application of United States labor and tax laws increases the cost of United States flagged vessels compared to comparable foreign flagged vessels. The Company’s business could be adversely affected if the Jones Act or international trade agreements or laws were to be modified or waived as to permit foreign flagged vessels to operate in the United States as these vessels are not subject to the same United States government imposed regulations, laws, and restrictions. Since the events of September 11, 2001, the United States government has taken steps to increase security of United States ports, coastal waters and inland waterways. The Company believes that it is unlikely that the current cabotage provisions of the Jones Act would be eliminated or significantly modified in a way that has a material adverse impact on the Company in the foreseeable future.",
        "The Secretary of Homeland Security is vested with the authority and discretion to waive the Jones Act to such extent and upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe whenever the Secretary deems that such action is necessary in the interest of national defense. On September 8, 2017, following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the Department of Homeland Security issued a waiver of the Jones Act for a 7-day period for shipments from New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Louisiana to South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Puerto Rico. The waiver was specifically tailored to address the transportation of refined petroleum products due to disruptions in hurricane-affected areas. On September 11, 2017, the waiver was extended for 11 days and expanded to include additional states. Following Hurricane Maria, on September 28, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security issued a waiver of the Jones Act for movement of products shipped from United States coastwise points to Puerto Rico through October 18, 2017. Waivers of the Jones Act, whether in response to natural disasters or otherwise, could result in increased competition from foreign tank vessel operators, which could negatively impact the marine transportation segment.",
        "The Company’s marine transportation segment is subject to extensive regulation by the USCG, federal laws, other federal agencies, various state laws and certain international conventions, as well as numerous environmental regulations. The majority of the Company’s vessels are subject to inspection by the USCG and carry certificates of inspection. The crews employed by the Company aboard vessels are licensed or certified by the USCG. The Company is required by various governmental agencies to obtain licenses, certificates and permits for its owned and operated vessels. The Company’s operations are also affected by various United States and state regulations and legislation enacted for protection of the environment. The Company incurs significant expenses and capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations and any significant new regulation or legislation, including climate change laws or regulations, could have an adverse effect on the Company.",
        "The Company’s marine transportation segment is subject to natural gas and crude oil prices as well as the volatility of their prices as well as the volatility in production of refined products and petrochemicals in the United States. For 2020, 52% of the marine transportation segment’s revenues were from the movement of petrochemicals, including the movement of raw materials and feedstocks from one refinery or petrochemical plant to another, as well as the movement of more finished products to end users and terminals for export. During 2020, petrochemical and refined products volumes decreased relative to 2019 and 2018, as a result of reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic and petrochemical and refinery plant shutdowns. However, the United States petrochemical industry continues to benefit from a low-cost domestically produced natural gas feedstock advantage, producing strong volumes of raw materials and intermediate products for transportation between Gulf Coast petrochemical plants and the transportation of more finished products to terminals for both domestic consumers and for export destinations. In addition, approximately seven new United States petrochemical projects, including expansion of existing plants or new plants, are scheduled to be completed during 2021, which should provide additional movements for the marine transportation segment. Higher natural gas and crude oil prices are generally better for the Company’s businesses, however higher natural gas prices and other factors could negatively impact the United States petrochemical industry and its production volumes, which could negatively impact the Company.",

        "Demand for tank barge transportation services is driven by the production of volumes of the bulk liquid commodities such as petrochemicals, black oil and refined petroleum products that the Company transports by tank barge. This production can depend on the prevailing level of natural gas and crude oil prices, as well as the volatility of their prices. In general, lower energy prices are good for the United States economy and typically translate into increased petrochemical and refined product demand and therefore increased demand for tank barge transportation services. However, during 2016 and 2017 lower crude oil prices resulted in a decline in domestic crude oil and natural gas condensate production and reduced volumes to be transported by tank barge. The Company estimates that at the beginning of 2015 there were approximately 550 inland tank barges and 35 coastal tank barges in the 195,000 barrels or less category transporting crude oil and natural gas condensate. At the end of 2016, the Company estimated that approximately 140 inland tank barges and approximately 10 coastal tank barges in the 195,000 barrels or less category were transporting such products, a reduction of approximately 410 inland tank barges and 25 coastal tank barges that moved into other markets. At the end of 2017, the Company estimated that approximately 250 inland tank barges and approximately three coastal tank barges were transporting crude and natural gas condensate. At the end of 2018, the Company estimates that approximately 375 inland tank barges and approximately three coastal tank barges were transporting crude and natural gas condensate. As of the end of 2019, the Company estimates that approximately 335 inland tank barges and approximately five coastal tank barges were transporting crude and natural gas condensate. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price volatility resulted in a sharp decrease in volumes of crude and natural gas condensate being transported. As of the end of 2020, the Company estimates that approximately 100 to 150 inland tank barges and one coastal tank barge were transporting crude and natural gas condensate. Volatility in the price of natural gas and crude oil can also result in heightened uncertainty which may lead to decreased production and delays in new petrochemical and refinery plant construction. Increased competition for available black oil and petrochemical barge moves caused by reduced crude oil and natural gas condensate production could have an adverse impact on the Company’s marine transportation segment including as a result of lower spot and term contract rates and/or reluctance to enter into or extend term contracts.",
        "The Company’s marine transportation segment could be adversely impacted by the construction of tank barges by its competitors. At the present time, there are an estimated 4,000 inland tank barges in the United States, of which the Company operates 1,066, or 27%. The number of tank barges peaked at an estimated 4,200 in 1982, slowly declined to 2,750 by 2003, and then gradually increased to an estimated 3,850 by the end of 2015 and 2016 and remained relatively flat since 2015. For 2018, the Company estimated that industry-wide 75 new tank barges were placed in service, of which one was by the Company, and 100 tank barges were retired, 48 of which were by the Company. For 2019, the Company estimated that industry-wide 150 new tank barges were placed in service, of which none were by the Company, and 100 tank barges were retired, 17 of which were by the Company. For 2020, the Company estimated that industry-wide approximately 150 new tank barges were placed in service, six of which were purchased by the Company from another operator, and approximately 150 tank barges were retired, 95 of which were by the Company. The increase for 2015 reflected the improved demand for inland petrochemical, refined petroleum products and black oil barges experienced in 2014 and federal tax incentives on new equipment. The decrease in the number of tank barges at the end of 2018 was primarily due to continued industry-wide tank barge retirements and minimal new tank barge construction. The Company estimates that approximately 35 new tank barges have been ordered during 2020 for delivery in 2021 and expects many older tank barges, including an expected 26 by the Company, will be retired, dependent on 2021 market conditions.",
        "The long-term risk of an oversupply of inland tank barges may be mitigated by the fact that the inland tank barge industry has approximately 350 tank barges that are over 30 years old and approximately 260 of those over 40 years old. Given the age profile of the industry inland tank barge fleet and extensive customer vetting standards, the expectation is that older tank barges will continue to be removed from service and replaced by new tank barges as needed, with the extent of both retirements and new builds dependent on petrochemical and refinery production levels and crude oil and natural gas condensate movements, both of which can have a direct effect on industry-wide tank barge utilization, as well as term and spot contract rates.",

        "During 2018, 2019, and 2020, a decline in industry-wide demand for the movement of crude oil and natural gas condensate transportation volumes increased available capacity and resulted in some reluctance among certain customers to extend term contracts, which led to an increase in the number of coastal vessels operating in the spot market. In addition, the Company and the industry added new coastal tank barge capacity during 2018, 2019, and 2020. Much of this new capacity is replacement capacity for older vessels anticipated to be retired.",
        "The Company estimates there are approximately 280 tank barges operating in the 195,000 barrels or less coastal industry fleet, the sector of the market in which the Company operates, and approximately 20 of those are over 25 years old. In June 2018, the Company purchased a 155,000 barrel coastal ATB under construction from another operator that was delivered to the Company in the 2018 fourth quarter. The Company is aware of three coastal ATBs placed in service in 2018, two in 2019, and one in 2020 by competitors. There is currently one announced small specialized coastal ATB under construction by a competitor for delivery in 2021.",
        "Higher fuel prices could increase operating expenses and fuel price volatility could reduce profitability. The cost of fuel during 2020 was approximately 6% of marine transportation revenue. All of the Company’s marine transportation term contracts contain fuel escalation clauses, or the customer pays for the fuel. However, there is generally a 30 to 90 day delay before contracts are adjusted depending on the specific contract. In general, the fuel escalation clauses are effective over the long-term in allowing the Company to adjust to changes in fuel costs due to fuel price changes; however, the short-term effectiveness of the fuel escalation clauses can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, specific terms of the fuel escalation formulas, fuel price volatility, navigating conditions, tow sizes, trip routing, and the location of loading and discharge ports that may result in the Company over or under recovering its fuel costs. The Company’s spot contract rates generally reflect current fuel prices at the time the contract is signed but do not have escalators for fuel.",
        "Significant increases in the construction cost of tank barges and towing vessels may limit the Company’s ability to earn an adequate return on its investment in new tank barges and towing vessels. The price of steel, economic conditions, and supply and demand dynamics can significantly impact the construction cost of new tank barges and towing vessels. Over the last 20 years, the Company’s average construction price for a new 30,000 barrel capacity inland tank barge has fluctuated up or down significantly. For example, the average construction price for a new 30,000 barrel capacity tank barge in 2009 was approximately 90% higher than in 2000, with increases primarily related to higher steel costs. During 2009, the United States and global recession negatively impacted demand levels for inland tank barges and as a result, the construction price of inland tank barges fell significantly in 2010, primarily due to a significant decrease in steel prices, as well as a decrease in the number of tank barges ordered. In 2018 through 2020, increases in steel costs and improvement in supply and demand dynamics resulted in construction prices for a new 30,000 barrel tank barge increasing compared to prices in 2017 when there was an industry-wide over-capacity of inland tank barges in the market.",
        "The Company’s marine transportation segment could be adversely impacted by the failure of the Company’s shipyard vendors to deliver new vessels according to contractually agreed delivery schedules and terms. The Company contracts with shipyards to build new vessels and currently has many vessels under construction. Construction projects are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns, resulting from shortages of equipment, materials and skilled labor; lack of shipyard availability; unforeseen design and engineering problems; work stoppages; weather interference; unanticipated cost increases; unscheduled delays in the delivery of material and equipment; and financial and other difficulties at shipyards including labor disputes, shipyard insolvency and inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals. A significant delay in the construction of new vessels or a shipyard’s inability to perform under the construction contract could negatively impact the Company’s ability to fulfill contract commitments and to realize timely revenues with respect to vessels under construction. Significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction could also adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. To date, the Company has not experienced significant shipyard delays associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including at its subsidiary, San Jac.",

        "The Company is subject to competition in its marine transportation segment. The inland and coastal tank barge industry remains very fragmented and competitive. The Company’s primary competitors are noncaptive inland tank barge operators and coastal operators. The Company also competes with companies who operate refined product and petrochemical pipelines, railroad tank cars and tractor-trailer tank trucks. Increased competition from any significant expansion of or additions to facilities or equipment by the Company’s competitors could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations. In addition, the Company’s failure to adhere to its safety, reliability and performance standards may impact its ability to retain current customers or attract new customers.",
        "Distribution and Services Segment Risk Factors",
        "The Company’s distribution and services segment could be adversely impacted by future legislation, executive or other governmental orders, or additional regulation of oil and gas extraction, including hydraulic fracturing practices. The Company, through its United and S&S subsidiaries, is a distributor and service provider of engine and transmission related products for the oil and gas services, power generation and transportation industries, and a manufacturer of oilfield service equipment, including pressure pumping units. The EPA is studying hydraulic fracturing practices, and legislation may be enacted by Congress that would authorize the EPA to impose additional regulations on hydraulic fracturing. In addition, a number of states have adopted or are evaluating the adoption of legislation or regulations governing hydraulic fracturing or byproducts of the fracturing process. In January 2021, the Secretary of the Interior ordered a 60-day pause on issuing new drilling permits and new leases on federal lands in response to a related executive order issued by President Biden, and it is uncertain what further action may be taken. Such federal or state legislation, executive or governmental orders, and/or regulations could materially impact customers’ operations and greatly reduce or eliminate demand for the Company’s pressure pumping fracturing equipment and related products. The Company is unable to predict whether future legislation or any other regulations will ultimately be enacted and, if so, the impact on the Company’s distribution and services segment.",
        "The Company’s distribution and services segment could be adversely impacted by the construction of pressure pumping units by its competitors. In early 2015, an estimated 21.0 million horsepower of pressure pumping units were working, or available to work, in North America. By late 2016, the working horsepower in North America had declined to an estimated 6.0 million, with an estimated 2.0 million horsepower scrapped, an estimated 2.0 million horsepower available for work and an estimated 12.5 million horsepower stacked, the large majority of which would require major service before being placed back in service. A significant drop in demand due to the low price of crude oil resulted in an oversupply in the pressure pumping market and negatively impacted the Company’s 2015 and 2016 results of operations. During 2017 and 2018, with the stabilization of crude oil prices in the $40 to $70 per barrel range, the United States land rig count improved and service intensity in the well completion business increased. As a result, the Company experienced a healthy rebound in service demand during 2018, particularly with pressure pumping unit remanufacturing and transmission overhauls, and with the acquisition of S&S in September 2017, the manufacture of oilfield service equipment, including pressure pumping units, and the sale of transmissions. At the end of 2019, an estimated 15.0 million horsepower of pressure pumping units were working in North America, with an estimated 6.0 million horsepower available to work, and 3.0 million horsepower stacked and in need of major repair. During 2020, a significant reduction in oilfield activity as a result of oil price volatility throughout 2019 and 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decrease to an estimated 6.0 million horsepower of pressure pumping units working in North America, with an estimated 1.5 million horsepower available to work, and 12.0 million horsepower stacked and in need of major repair. Increased expansion of, or additions to, facilities or equipment by the Company’s competitors could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations.",
        "Prevailing natural gas and crude oil prices, as well as the volatility of their prices, could have an adverse effect on the distribution and services segment business. Lower energy prices generally result in a decrease in the number of oil and gas wells being drilled. Oilfield service companies reduce their capital spending, resulting in decreased demand for new parts and equipment, including pressure pumping units, provided by the Company’s distribution and services segment. This may also lead to order cancellations from customers or customers requesting to delay delivery of new equipment. The Company also services offshore supply vessels and offshore drillings rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as internationally. Low energy prices may negatively impact the number of wells drilled in the Gulf of Mexico and international waters. Prolonged downturns in oil and gas prices may cause substantial declines in oilfield service and exploration expenditures and could adversely impact oil and gas manufacturing, remanufacturing, parts and distribution business. In addition, energy price volatility may also result in difficulties in the Company’s ability to ramp up and ramp down production on a timely basis and, therefore, could result in an adverse impact on the Company’s distribution and services segment.",

        "The Company is subject to competition in its distribution and services segment. The distribution and services industry is very competitive. The segment’s oil and gas market’s principal competitors are independent distribution and service and oilfield manufacturing companies and other factory-authorized distributors and service centers. In addition, certain oilfield service companies that are customers of the Company also manufacture and service a portion of their own oilfield equipment. Increased competition in the distribution and services industry and continued low price of natural gas, crude oil or natural gas condensate, and resulting decline in drilling for such natural resources in North American shale formations, could result in less oilfield equipment being manufactured and remanufactured, lower rates for service and parts pricing and result in less manufacturing, remanufacturing, service and repair opportunities and parts sales for the Company. For the commercial and industrial market, the segment’s primary marine diesel competitors are independent diesel services companies and other factory-authorized distributors, authorized service centers and authorized marine dealers. Certain operators of diesel powered marine equipment also elect to maintain in-house service capabilities. For power generation, the primary competitors are other independent service companies.",
        "Loss of a distributorship or other significant business relationship could adversely affect the Company’s distribution and services segment. The Company’s distribution and services segment has had a relationship with EMD, the largest manufacturer of medium-speed diesel engines, for over 50 years. The Company, through Kirby Engine Systems, serves as both an EMD distributor and service center for select markets and locations for both service and parts. With the acquisition of S&S in September 2017, the Company added additional EMD exclusive distributorship rights in key states, primarily through the Central, South and Eastern areas of the United States. With the S&S acquisition, the Company became the United States distributor for EMD marine and power generation applications. Sales and service of EMD products account for approximately 4% of the Company’s revenues for 2020. Although the Company considers its relationship with EMD to be strong, the loss of the EMD distributorship and service rights, or a disruption of the supply of EMD parts, could have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to service its customers. In 2020, with the acquisition of Convoy Servicing Company and Agility Fleet Services, LLC, the Company expanded its dealership network of Thermo King refrigeration systems for trucks, railroad cars, and other land transportation markets in Texas and Colorado. In 2020, sales and service of Thermo King products comprised approximately 5% of the Company’s revenues.",
        "United and S&S have maintained continuous exclusive distribution rights for MTU and Allison since the 1940s. United and S&S are two of MTU’s top five distributors of off-highway engines in North America, with exclusive distribution rights in multiple states. In addition, as distributors of Allison products, United and S&S have exclusive distribution rights in multiple key growth states. United and S&S are also the distributor for parts, service and warranty on Daimler truck engines and related equipment in multiple states. Sales and service of MTU, Allison, and Daimler products accounted for approximately 8% of the Company’s revenues during 2020. Although the Company considers its relationships with MTU, Allison, and Daimler to be strong, the loss of MTU, Allison, or Daimler distributorships and service rights, or a disruption of the supply of MTU or Allison parts, could have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to service its customers.",
        "In addition to its relationships with MTU, Allison, and Daimler, the Company also has relationships with many other distributors and parts suppliers and the loss of a distributorship and service rights, or a disruption of the supply of parts from any of these other distributors or part suppliers could also have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to service its customers.",
        "General Risk Factors",
        "The Company is subject to adverse weather conditions in its marine transportation and distribution and services segments. The Company’s marine transportation segment is subject to weather condition volatility. Adverse weather conditions such as high or low water on the inland waterway systems, fog and ice, tropical storms, hurricanes, and tsunamis on both the inland waterway systems and throughout the United States coastal waters can impair the operating efficiencies of the marine fleet. Such adverse weather conditions can cause a delay, diversion or postponement of shipments of products and are totally beyond the control of the Company. Tropical storms and hurricanes may also impact the Company’s customers resulting in reduced demand for the Company’s services. In addition, adverse water and weather conditions can negatively affect a towing vessel’s performance, tow size, loading drafts, fleet efficiency, limit navigation periods and dictate horsepower requirements. The Company’s distribution and services segment is also subject to tropical storms and hurricanes impacting its coastal locations and those of its customers as well as tornadoes impacting its Oklahoma facilities. The risk of flooding as a result of hurricanes and tropical storms as well as other weather events may impede travel via roadways, suspend service work, and impact deliveries and the Company’s ability to fulfill orders or provide services in the distribution and services segment.",

        "The Company may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses, and any inability to do so may adversely affect the Company’s business and hinder its ability to grow. The Company has made asset and business acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions of assets or businesses in the future that complement or expand the Company’s current business. The Company may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if attractive acquisition opportunities are identified, the Company may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms. The success of any completed acquisition depends on the Company’s ability to integrate the acquired assets or business effectively into the Company’s existing operations. The process of integrating acquired assets or businesses may involve difficulties that require a disproportionate amount of the Company’s managerial and financial resources to resolve. The value of acquired assets or businesses may be negatively impacted by a variety of circumstances unknown to the Company prior to the acquisition. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. The Company’s failure to achieve synergies, to integrate successfully the acquired businesses and assets into the Company’s existing operations, or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, agreements governing the Company’s indebtedness from time to time may impose certain limitations on the Company’s ability to undertake acquisitions or make investments or may limit the Company’s ability to incur certain indebtedness and liens, which could limit the Company’s ability to make acquisitions.",
        "The Company’s failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”),or similar local applicable anti-bribery laws, could have a negative impact on its ongoing operations. The Company’s operations outside the United States require the Company to comply with both a number of United States and international regulations. For example, in addition to any similar applicable local anti-bribery laws, its operations in countries outside the United States are subject to the FCPA, which prohibits United States companies or their employees and third party representatives from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity, or obtain any unfair advantage. The Company has internal control policies and procedures and has implemented training and compliance programs for its employees and third party representatives with respect to the FCPA. However, the Company’s policies, procedures and programs may not always protect it from reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees or third party representatives, and severe criminal or civil sanctions could be the result of violations of the FCPA or any other applicable anti-bribery law in countries where the Company does business. The Company is also subject to the risks that its employees, joint venture partners, and third party representatives outside of the United States may fail to comply with other applicable laws.",
        "The Company is subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation, regulation and international accords. Greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon emissions or energy use, have increasingly become the subject of a large amount of international, national, regional, state and local attention. Pursuant to an April 2007 decision of the United States Supreme Court, the EPA was required to consider if carbon dioxide was a pollutant that endangers public health. On December 7, 2009, the EPA issued its “endangerment finding” regarding greenhouse gasses under the CAA. The EPA found that the emission of six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (which is emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels), may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. Based on this finding, the EPA defined the mix of these six greenhouse gases to be “air pollution” subject to regulation under the CAA. Although the EPA has stated a preference that greenhouse gas regulation be based on new federal legislation rather than the existing CAA, many sources of greenhouse gas emissions may be regulated without the need for further legislation.",
        "The United States Congress has considered in the past legislation that would create an economy-wide “cap-and-trade” system that would establish a limit (or cap) on overall greenhouse gas emissions and create a market for the purchase and sale of emissions permits or “allowances.” Any proposed cap-and-trade legislation would likely affect the chemical industry due to anticipated increases in energy costs as fuel providers pass on the cost of the emissions allowances, which they would be required to obtain under cap-and-trade to cover the emissions from fuel production and the eventual use of fuel by the Company or its energy suppliers. In addition, cap-and-trade proposals would likely increase the cost of energy, including purchases of diesel fuel, steam and electricity, and certain raw materials used or transported by the Company. Proposed domestic and international cap-and-trade systems could materially increase raw material and operating costs of the Company’s customer base. Future environmental regulatory developments related to climate change in the United States that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could result in financial impacts on the Company’s operations that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.",

The Company is dependent on its critical operating assets and technology infrastructure and must maintain and rely upon critical information systems and security of its assets for the effective and safe operation of its businesses. These assets include vessels, vessel equipment, property and facilities, as well as information systems, such as software applications, hardware equipment, and data networks and telecommunications.",
        "The Company’s critical assets and information systems, including the Company’s proprietary vessel management computer system, are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources, including but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist acts, cyber-security attacks, software viruses, and power failures. In addition to standard safety operating procedures, the Company has implemented measures such as business continuity plans, hurricane preparedness plans, emergency recovery processes, and security preparedness plans to protect physical assets and to recover from damage to such assets. The Company has also implemented virus protection software, intrusion detection systems and annual attack and penetration audits to protect information systems to mitigate these risks. However, the Company cannot guarantee that its critical assets or information systems cannot be damaged or compromised.",
        "Any damage or compromise of its critical assets or data security or its inability to use or access these critical assets and information systems could adversely impact the efficient and safe operation of its businesses, or result in the failure to safely operate its equipment, and maintain the confidentiality of data of its customers or its employees and could subject the Company to increased operating expenses or legal action, which could have an adverse effect on the Company.",
        "A deterioration of the Company’s credit profile, disruptions of the credit markets or higher interest rates could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt. Deterioration in the Company’s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs. If the Company’s credit profile deteriorates significantly its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, its cost of debt may increase, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms. Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its Revolving Credit Facility to support its operations as needed, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds on acceptable terms could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the pricing grids on Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan contain a ratings grid that includes a possible increase in borrowing rates if the Company’s rating declines. Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its Revolving Credit Facility based on floating rates. Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, which would adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations. In addition, as the floating rate on certain borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is tied to LIBOR, the uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR as well as the transition from LIBOR to an alternate benchmark rate or rates could adversely affect the Company’s financing costs.",
        "Continuing widespread health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the recent global COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In December 2019, COVID-19 surfaced in Wuhan, China. In response to the resulting pandemic, various countries, including the United States, either mandated or recommended business closures, travel restrictions or limitations, social distancing, and/or self-quarantine, among other actions. Additionally, various state and local governments in locations where the Company operates took similar actions. The full impact and duration of the outbreak is still unknown and the situation continues to evolve. Many governments are in various stages of removing or easing these actions. In some cases, governments have reinstated actions or slowed reopenings and they may impose new actions in an effort to reduce or manage current or anticipated levels of infection. The full extent and duration of these impacts is unknown at this time, but there has been and continues to be a negative impact on the global and United States economies, including the oil and gas industry, which has reduced demand for the Company’s products and services.",
        "These impacts could continue to place limitations on the Company’s ability to execute on its business plan and materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company continues to monitor the situation, actively implemented policies and procedures to address the situation, including its pandemic response plan and business continuity plan, and took steps to reduce costs. As the pandemic continues to further unfold, the Company may further adjust its current policies and procedures as government mandates or recommendations change or as more information and guidance become available. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed above, any of which could have a material effect on the Company. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that the Company is not aware of currently.",

        "For purposes of Management’s Discussion, all net earnings per share attributable to Kirby common stockholders are “diluted earnings per share.” The weighted average number of common shares outstanding applicable to diluted earnings per share for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 59,912,000, 59,909,000 and 59,689,000, respectively.",
        "Overview",
        "The Company is the nation’s largest domestic tank barge operator, transporting bulk liquid products throughout the Mississippi River System, on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, coastwise along all three United States coasts, and in Alaska and Hawaii. The Company transports petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals by tank barge. As of December 31, 2020, the Company operated a fleet of 1,066 inland tank barges with 24.1 million barrels of capacity, and operated an average of 248 inland towboats during the 2020 fourth quarter. The Company’s coastal fleet consisted of 44 tank barges with 4.2 million barrels of capacity and 44 coastal tugboats. The Company also owns and operates four offshore dry-bulk cargo barges, four offshore tugboats and one docking tugboat transporting dry-bulk commodities in United States coastal trade. Through its distribution and services segment, the Company provides after-market service and parts for engines, transmissions, reduction gears, and related equipment used in oilfield services, marine, power generation, on-highway, and other industrial applications. The Company also rents equipment including generators, industrial compressors, railcar movers, and high capacity lift trucks for use in a variety of industrial markets, and manufactures and remanufactures oilfield service equipment, including pressure pumping units, for land-based oilfield service customers.",
        "For 2020, net loss attributable to Kirby was $272,546,000, or $4.55 per share, on revenues of $2,171,408,000, compared to 2019 net earnings attributable to Kirby of $142,347,000, or $2.37 per share, on revenues of $2,838,399,000. The 2020 first quarter included $561,274,000 before taxes, $433,341,000 after taxes, or $7.24 per share, non-cash charges related to inventory write-downs, impairment of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and property and equipment, and impairment of goodwill in the distribution and services segment. See Note 7, Impairments and Other Charges for additional information. In addition, the 2020 first quarter was favorably impacted by an income tax benefit of $50,824,000, or $0.85 per share related to net operating losses generated in 2018 and 2019 used to offset taxable income generated between 2013 and 2017. See Note 9, Taxes on Income for additional information. The 2019 fourth quarter included $35,525,000 before taxes, $27,978,000 after taxes, or $0.47 per share, non-cash inventory write-downs and $4,757,000 before taxes, $3,747,000 after taxes, or $0.06 per share, severance and early retirement expense.",
        "Marine Transportation",
        "For 2020, 65% of the Company’s revenues were generated by its marine transportation segment. The segment’s customers include many of the major petrochemical and refining companies that operate in the United States. Products transported include intermediate materials used to produce many of the end products used widely by businesses and consumers — plastics, fibers, paints, detergents, oil additives and paper, among others, as well as residual fuel oil, ship bunkers, asphalt, gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, crude oil, natural gas condensate and agricultural chemicals. Consequently, the Company’s marine transportation business is directly affected by the volumes produced by the Company’s petroleum, petrochemical and refining customer base.",

        "The Company’s marine transportation segment’s revenues for 2020 decreased 12% compared to 2019 and operating income decreased 24%, compared to 2019. The decreases were primarily due to reduced barge utilization in the inland and coastal markets and decreased term and spot contract pricing in the inland market, each as a result of a reduction in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lower fuel rebills, retirements of three large coastal barges, and planned shipyard activity in the coastal market. These reductions were partially offset by the acquisition of the Savage Inland Marine, LLC (“Savage”) fleet acquired on April 1, 2020 and the Cenac Marine Services, LLC (“Cenac”) fleet acquired on March 14, 2019. The 2020 third quarter was impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms along the East and Gulf Coasts and the closure of the Illinois river. The 2020 first quarter and 2019 first six months were each impacted by poor operating conditions and high delay days due to heavy fog and wind along the Gulf Coast, high water on the Mississippi River System, and closures of key waterways as a result of lock maintenance projects, as well as increased shipyard days on large capacity coastal vessels. The 2019 first six months was also impacted by prolonged periods of ice on the Illinois River and a fire at a chemical storage facility on the Houston Ship Channel. For 2020 and 2019, the inland tank barge fleet contributed 78% and 77%, respectively, and the coastal fleet contributed 22% and 23%, respectively, of marine transportation revenues.",
        "During 2020, reduced demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic slowdown contributed to lower barge utilization. Inland tank barge utilization levels averaged in the low to mid-90% range during the 2020 first quarter, the mid-80% range during the 2020 second quarter, the low 70% range during the 2020 third quarter, and the high 60% range during the 2020 fourth quarter. For 2019, barge utilization averaged in the mid-90% range during both the first and second quarters and the low 90% range during both the third and fourth quarters. The 2020 first quarter and full year 2019 each experienced strong demand from petrochemicals, black oil, and refined petroleum products customers. Extensive delay days due to poor operating conditions and lock maintenance projects in the 2020 first quarter and 2019 first six months slowed the transport of customer cargoes and contributed to strong barge utilization during those periods.",
        "Coastal tank barge utilization levels averaged in the low to mid-80% range during the 2020 first quarter and the mid-70% range during each of the 2020 second, third, and fourth quarters. In 2019, barge utilization averaged in the low 80% range during the first quarter and the mid-80% range during each of the second, third, and fourth quarters. Barge utilization in the coastal marine fleet continued to be impacted by the oversupply of smaller tank barges in the coastal industry during 2020 and 2019.",
        "During both 2020 and 2019, approximately 65% of the inland marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and 35% were spot contract revenues. These allocations provide the operations with a reasonably predictable revenue stream. Inland time charters, which insulate the Company from revenue fluctuations caused by weather and navigational delays and temporary market declines, represented 66% of the inland revenues under term contracts during 2020 compared to 62% during 2019. Rates on inland term contracts renewed in the 2020 first quarter increased in the 1% to 3% average range compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 first quarter. Rates on inland term contracts renewed in the 2020 second quarter were flat compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 second quarter. Rates on inland term contracts renewed in the 2020 third quarter decreased in the 1% to 3% average range compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 third quarter. Rates on inland term contracts renewed in the 2020 fourth quarter decreased in the 10% to 12% average range compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 fourth quarter. Spot contract rates in the 2020 first quarter increased in the 4% to 6% average range compared to the 2019 first quarter. Spot contract rates in the 2020 second quarter decreased in the 5% to 10% average range compared to the 2019 second quarter. Spot contract rates in the 2020 third quarter decreased approximately 10% compared to the 2019 third quarter. Spot contract rates in the 2020 fourth quarter decreased approximately 25% compared to the 2019 fourth quarter. There was no material rate increase on January 1, 2020, related to annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of inland multi-year contracts.",
        "During 2020 and 2019, approximately 85% and 80%, respectively, of the coastal revenues were under term contracts and 15% and 20%, respectively, were spot contract revenues. Coastal time charters represented approximately 90% of coastal revenues under term contracts during 2020 compared to 85% during 2019. Spot and term contract pricing in the coastal market are contingent on various factors including geographic location, vessel capacity, vessel type and product serviced. Rates on coastal term contracts renewed in the 2020 first quarter increased in the 10% to 15% average range compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 first quarter. Rates on coastal term contracts renewed in the 2020 second quarter were flat compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 second quarter. Rates on coastal term contracts renewed in both the 2020 third and fourth quarters decreased in the 4% to 6% average range compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 third and fourth quarters. Spot market rates in the 2020 first quarter increased in the 10% to 15% average range compared to the 2019 first quarter. Spot market rates in each of the 2020 second, third, and fourth quarters were flat compared to the 2019 second, third, and fourth quarters.",

        "Distribution and Services",
        "During 2020, the distribution and services segment generated 35% of the Company’s revenues, of which 93% was generated from service and parts and 7% from manufacturing. The results of the distribution and services segment are largely influenced by cycles of the land-based oilfield service and oil and gas operator and producer markets, marine, power generation, on-highway and other industrial markets.",
        "Distribution and services revenues for 2020 decreased 39% compared to 2019 and operating income decreased 118% compared to 2019. The decreases were primarily attributable to reduced activity in the oilfield as a result of oil price volatility throughout 2019 and 2020, the extensive downturn in oil and gas exploration due to low oil prices, caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, an oversupply of pressure pumping equipment in North America, and reduced spending and enhanced cash flow discipline for the Company’s major oilfield customers. As a result, customer demand and incremental orders for new and remanufactured pressure pumping equipment and sales of new and overhauled transmissions and related parts and service declined during 2020. For 2020, the oil and gas market represented approximately 26% of distribution and services revenues.",
        "The 2020 commercial and industrial market revenues decreased compared to 2019, primarily due to reductions in on-highway and power generation service demand as a result of the COVID‑19 pandemic and the resulting economic slowdown and nationwide, state, and local stay-at-home orders, partially offset by contributions from the Convoy Servicing Company and Agility Fleet Services, LLC (collectively “Convoy”) acquisition on January 3, 2020. Demand in the marine business was also down due to reduced major overhaul activity. For 2020, the commercial and industrial market contributed 74% of the distribution and services revenues.",
        "The distribution and services operating margin for 2020 was (1.6)% compared to 5.4% for 2019.",
        "Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures",
        "The Company generated favorable operating cash flow during 2020 with net cash provided by operating activities of $444,940,000 compared to $511,813,000 of net cash provided by operating activities for 2019, a 13% decrease. The decline was driven by decreased revenues and operating income in both the marine transportation and distribution and services segments. The decrease in the marine transportation segment was driven by decreased barge utilization in the inland and coastal markets and decreased term and spot contract pricing in the inland market, each as a result of a reduction in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the Savage acquisition in April 2020 and the Cenac acquisition in March 2019 and reduced costs. The decrease in the distribution and services segment was primarily attributable to reduced activity in the oilfield as a result of oil price volatility throughout 2019 and 2020, the extensive downturn in oil and gas exploration due to low oil prices, caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, an oversupply of pressure pumping equipment in North America, and reduced spending and enhanced cash flow discipline for the Company’s major oilfield customers. The decline was also partially offset by changes in certain operating assets and liabilities primarily related to reduced incentive compensation payouts in the 2020 first quarter and a larger decrease in trade accounts receivable compared to an increase during 2019, driven by reduced business activity levels in both the marine transportation and distribution and services segments. In addition, during 2020, the Company received a tax refund of $30,606,000 for its 2018 tax return related to net operating losses being carried back to offset taxable income generated during 2013. During 2020 and 2019, the Company generated cash of $17,310,000 and $57,657,000, respectively, from proceeds from the disposition of assets, and $353,000 and $5,743,000, respectively, from proceeds from the exercise of stock options.",
        "For 2020, cash generated and borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility were used for capital expenditures of $148,185,000, (including a decrease in accrued capital expenditures of $13,280,000) including $7,506,000 for inland towboat construction and $140,679,000 primarily for upgrading existing marine equipment and marine transportation and distribution and services facilities.

The Company also used $262,491,000 for acquisitions of businesses and marine equipment, more fully described under Acquisitions below.",
        "The Company’s debt-to-capitalization ratio increased to 32.2% at December 31, 2020 from 28.9% at December 31, 2019, primarily due to borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to acquire the Savage fleet in the 2020 second quarter and the Convoy acquisition in the 2020 first quarter as well as the decrease in total equity, primarily from the net loss attributable to Kirby for 2020 of $272,546,000. The Company’s debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 is detailed in Long-Term Financing below.",
        "During 2020, the Company acquired 92 inland tank barges from Savage with a total capacity of approximately 2.5 million barrels, purchased six newly constructed inland pressure barges, retired 94 inland tank barges, transferred one tank barge to coastal, returned two leased inland tank barges, and brought back into service 12 inland tank barges. The net result was an increase of 13 inland tank barges and approximately 0.7 million barrels of capacity during 2020.",

        "Outlook",
        "While there remains significant uncertainty around the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company expects improved business activity and utilization levels in the second half of 2021. The first half of 2021 is expected to remain challenging until the pandemic eases and refinery utilization materially recovers and the U.S. economy rebounds. In the first quarter, the Company expects weak market conditions in marine transportation to continue with pricing pressure on contract renewals. Additionally, surging cases of COVID-19 across the United States have impacted the Company’s ability to crew its vessels, resulting in delays and in some cases, lost revenue primarily impacting the Company’s offshore vessels. As a result, first quarter 2021 earnings are expected to decline sequentially with improving results thereafter as the effects of the pandemic moderate and demand for the Company’s products and services increases.",
        "In the inland marine transportation market, conditions are expected to remain challenging in the coming months, with gradual improvement in the second quarter and a more meaningful recovery in the second half of 2021. Barge utilization is projected to start the year in the low to mid-70% range and improve into the high 80% to low 90% range by the end of the year. Pricing, which typically improves with barge utilization, is expected to remain under pressure in the near-term. First quarter revenues and operating margin are expected to be the lowest of the year, sequentially down from the 2020 fourth quarter due to the impact of lower pricing on term contract renewals and increased delays from seasonal winter weather. Anticipated improvements in the spot market later in 2021 should contribute to increased barge utilization and better operating margins as the year progresses. However, the full year impact of lower term contract pricing is expected to result in full year operating margins lower than the mid-teens margins realized in 2020.",
        "As of December 31, 2020, the Company estimated there were approximately 4,000 inland tank barges in the industry fleet, of which approximately 350 were over 30 years old and approximately 260 of those over 40 years old. The Company estimates that approximately 35 new tank barges have been ordered for delivery in 2021 and many older tank barges, including an expected 26 by the Company, will be retired, dependent on 2021 market conditions. Historically, 75 to 150 older inland tank barges are retired from service each year industry-wide. The extent of the retirements is dependent on petrochemical and refinery production levels, and crude oil and natural gas condensate movements, both of which can have a direct effect on industry-wide tank barge utilization, as well as term and spot contract rates.",

        "In the coastal marine transportation market, with limited spot demand and the return of some term equipment, lower term contract pricing, crewing difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the retirement of three older large capacity coastal vessels during 2020, and the retirement of an additional vessel in mid-2021, financial results are expected to be lower in 2021 than 2020. In the 2021 first quarter, the Company expects coastal revenues and operating margin to decline compared to the 2020 fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of lower term contract pricing and challenges crewing vessels due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the full year, coastal revenues are expected to decline compared to 2020 with negative operating margins, the magnitude of which will be dependent on the timing of a material improvement in refined products and black oil demand later in 2021.",
        "As of December 31, 2020, the Company estimated there were approximately 280 tank barges operating in the 195,000 barrels or less coastal industry fleet, the sector of the market in which the Company operates, and approximately 20 of those were over 25 years old. The Company is aware of one announced small specialized coastal ATB in the 195,000 barrels or less category under construction by a competitor for delivery in 2021.",
        "The results of the distribution and services segment are largely influenced by the cycles of the land-based oilfield service and oil and gas operator and producer markets, marine, power generation, on-highway and other industrial markets. Improving economic activity and growth in the oilfield are expected to boost activity levels and contribute to meaningful year-over-year improvement in revenue and operating income. In commercial and industrial, revenues are expected to benefit from improving economic conditions as well as from growth in the on-highway market, due in part to the Company’s new online parts sales platform which was launched in 2020. However, these gains are expected to be partially offset by lower sales of new marine engines which remained strong throughout 2020.",
        "In the distribution and services oil and gas market, higher commodity prices and increasing well completions activity are expected to contribute to improved demand for new transmission, service, and parts, as well as higher pressure pumping remanufacturing activity. Additionally, a heightened focus on sustainability across the energy sector and industrial complex is expected to result in continued growth in new orders for Kirby’s portfolio of environmentally friendly equipment during the year. Overall, operating margins in distribution and services are expected to be positive in the low to mid-single digits for the full year with the first quarter being the lowest and the third quarter being the highest prior to normal seasonal declines in the fourth quarter.",

        "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates",
        "The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates based on different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are described below. It is also suggested that the Company’s significant accounting policies, as described in the Company’s financial statements in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, be read in conjunction with this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.",
        "Accounts Receivable. The Company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business. The Company regularly reviews its accounts and estimates the amount of uncollectible receivables each period and establishes an allowance for uncollectible amounts. The amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts, information about the current financial strength of customers, and other relevant information. Estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period, and changes are recorded in the period they become known. Historically, credit risk with respect to these trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the financial strength of the Company’s customers; however, a United States or global recession or other adverse economic condition could impact the collectability of certain customers’ trade receivables which could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.",

        "Property, Maintenance and Repairs. Property is recorded at cost; improvements and betterments are capitalized as incurred. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets. When property items are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included in the statement of earnings. Maintenance and repairs on vessels built for use on the inland waterways are charged to operating expense as incurred and includes the costs incurred in USCG inspections unless the shipyard extends the life or improves the operating capacity of the vessel which results in the costs being capitalized. The Company’s ocean-going vessels are subject to regulatory drydocking requirements after certain periods of time to be inspected, have planned major maintenance performed and be recertified by the ABS. These recertifications generally occur twice in a five-year period. The Company defers the drydocking expenditures incurred on its ocean-going vessels due to regulatory marine inspections by the ABS and amortizes the costs of the shipyard over the period between drydockings, generally 30 or 60 months, depending on the type of major maintenance performed. Drydocking expenditures that extend the life or improve the operating capability of the vessel result in the costs being capitalized. Routine repairs and maintenance on ocean-going vessels are expensed as incurred. Interest is capitalized on the construction of new ocean-going vessels.",
        "The Company performs an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If a triggering event is identified, the Company compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company measures the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to its estimated fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss, if any. The assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, estimated fair market value of the assets and estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service the asset will be used, and estimated salvage values. Although the Company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable, deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result.",
        "Goodwill. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in transactions accounted for as a purchase is included in goodwill. Management monitors the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary. The amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is typically measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using an appropriate discount rate and valued based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, incorporating all tax impacts caused by the recognition of the impairment loss. The assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss, if any. Although the Company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable, deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result.",
        "Accrued Insurance. The Company is subject to property damage and casualty risks associated with operating vessels carrying large volumes of bulk liquid and dry cargo in a marine environment. The Company maintains insurance coverage against these risks subject to a deductible, below which the Company is liable. In addition to expensing claims below the deductible amount as incurred, the Company also maintains a reserve for losses that may have occurred but have not been reported to the Company, or are not yet fully developed. The Company uses historic experience and actuarial analysis by outside consultants to estimate an appropriate level of accrued liabilities. If the actual number of claims and magnitude were substantially greater than assumed, the required level of accrued liabilities for claims incurred but not reported or fully developed could be materially understated. The Company records receivables from its insurers for incurred claims above the Company’s deductible. If the solvency of the insurers became impaired, there could be an adverse impact on the accrued receivables and the availability of insurance.",

        "Marine transportation revenues for 2020 decreased 12% compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to reduced barge utilization in the inland and coastal markets and decreased term and spot contract pricing in the inland market, each as a result of a reduction in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lower fuel rebills, retirements of three large coastal barges, and planned shipyard activity in the coastal market. These reductions were partially offset by the acquisition of the Savage fleet acquired on April 1, 2020 and the Cenac fleet acquired on March 14, 2019. The 2020 third quarter was impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms along the East and Gulf Coasts and the closure of the Illinois River. The 2020 first quarter and 2019 first six months were each impacted by poor operating conditions and high delay days due to heavy fog and wind along the Gulf Coast, high water on the Mississippi River System, and closures of key waterways as a result of lock maintenance projects, as well as increased shipyard days on large capacity coastal vessels. The 2019 first six months was also impacted by prolonged periods of ice on the Illinois River and a fire at a chemical storage facility on the Houston Ship Channel. For 2020 and 2019, the inland tank barge fleet contributed 78% and 77%, respectively, and the coastal fleet contributed 22% and 23%, respectively, of marine transportation revenues. The Savage fleet was quickly integrated into the Company’s own fleet and the former Savage equipment began operating under Company contracts soon after the acquisition closed, with former Savage barges working with the Company’s existing towboats and vice versa resulting in differences in vessel utilization and pricing among individual assets and the consolidated fleet. Due to this quick integration, it is not practical to provide a specific amount of revenues for the Savage fleet but the acquisition in April 2020 was one of the factors that offset decreases in marine transportation revenues in 2020 as compared to 2019.",

In 2019, inland tank barge utilization levels averaged in the mid-90% range during both the 2019 first and second quarters and the low 90% range during both the 2019 third and fourth quarters. The 2020 first quarter and full year 2019 each experienced strong demand from petrochemicals, black oil, and refined petroleum products customers. Extensive delay days due to poor operating conditions and lock maintenance projects in the 2020 first quarter and 2019 first six months slowed the transport of customer cargoes and contributed to strong barge utilization during those periods.",

Barge utilization in the coastal marine fleet continued to be impacted by the oversupply of smaller tank barges in the coastal industry during 2020 and 2019.",
        "The petrochemical market, the Company’s largest market, contributed 52% of marine transportation revenues for 2020, reflecting reduced volumes from Gulf Coast petrochemical plants for both domestic consumption and to terminals for export destinations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, during the 2020 third quarter, the petrochemical complex along the Gulf Coast was impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms, reducing barge volumes and closing critical waterways for extended periods of time. During 2020, U.S. chemical plant capacity utilization declined to an average in the low to mid-70% range.",
        "The black oil market, which contributed 26% of marine transportation revenues for 2020, reflected reduced demand as refinery production levels and the export of refined petroleum products and fuel oils declined as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact from hurricanes and tropical storms along the Gulf Coast during the third and fourth quarters. During 2020, U.S. refinery utilization peaked in the low to mid-90% range early in the first quarter and troughed in the high 60% range during the second quarter. During the third and fourth quarters, refinery utilization stabilized in the low 70% to low 80% range with the low end resulting from significant hurricane and tropical storm activity along the Gulf Coast during September and October and increased to the low 80% range late in the fourth quarter. During 2020, the Company continued to transport crude oil and natural gas condensate produced from the Permian Basin as well as reduced volumes from the Eagle Ford shale formation in Texas, both along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway with inland vessels and in the Gulf of Mexico with coastal equipment. Additionally, the Company transported volumes of Utica natural gas condensate downriver from the Mid-Atlantic to the Gulf Coast and Canadian and Bakken crude downriver from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast.",
        "The refined petroleum products market, which contributed 19% of marine transportation revenues for 2020, reflected lower volumes in both the inland and coastal markets as a result of reduced demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact from hurricanes and tropical storms along the Gulf Coast during the third and fourth quarters. During 2020, U.S. refinery utilization peaked in the low to mid-90% range early in the first quarter and troughed in the high 60% range during the second quarter.

        "For 2020, the inland operations incurred 10,408 delay days, 22% fewer than the 13,259 delay days that occurred during 2019. Delay days measure the lost time incurred by a tow (towboat and one or more tank barges) during transit when the tow is stopped due to weather, lock conditions, or other navigational factors. Reduced delay days during 2020 is primarily due to lower barge utilization, despite significant delays associated with hurricane activity along the Gulf Coast during the third quarter. In addition, delay days for the 2020 first quarter and 2019 first six months reflected poor operating conditions due to heavy fog and wind along the Gulf Coast, high water conditions on the Mississippi River System, and closures of key waterways as a result of lock maintenance projects. The 2019 first six months was also impacted by prolonged periods of ice on the Illinois River and a fire at a chemical storage facility on the Houston Ship Channel.",
        "During both 2020 and 2019, approximately 65% of the inland marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and 35% were spot contract revenues. These allocations provide the operations with a reasonably predictable revenue stream. Inland time charters, which insulate the Company from revenue fluctuations caused by weather and navigational delays and temporary market declines, represented 66% of the inland revenues under term contracts during 2020 compared to 62% during 2019. Rates on inland term contracts renewed in the 2020 first quarter increased in the 1% to 3% average range compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 first quarter. Rates on inland term contracts renewed in the 2020 second quarter were flat compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 second quarter. Rates on inland term contracts renewed in the 2020 third quarter decreased in the 1% to 3% average range compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 third quarter. Rates on inland term contracts renewed in the 2020 fourth quarter decreased in the 10% to 12% average range compared to term contracts renewed in the 2019 fourth quarter.

Spot contract rates in the 2020 second quarter decreased in the 5% to 10% average range compared to the 2019 second quarter. Spot contract rates in the 2020 third quarter decreased approximately 10% compared to the 2019 third quarter. Spot contract rates in the 2020 fourth quarter decreased approximately 25% compared to the 2019 fourth quarter. There was no material rate increase on January 1, 2020, related to annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of inland multi-year contracts.",
        "During 2020 and 2019, approximately 85% and 80%, respectively, of the coastal revenues were under term contracts and 15% and 20%, respectively, were spot contract revenues. Coastal time charters represented approximately 90% of coastal revenues under term contracts during 2020 compared to 85% during 2019. Spot and term contract pricing in the coastal market are contingent on various factors including geographic location, vessel capacity, vessel type and product serviced.

        "Marine Transportation Revenues",
        "Marine transportation revenues for 2019 increased 7% compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the Higman fleet acquired on February 14, 2018, the Targa pressure barge fleet acquired on May 10, 2018, the CGBM inland tank barges acquired on December 14, 2018, and the Cenac fleet acquired on March 14, 2019, as well as improved barge utilization in the coastal market and higher spot and term contract pricing in the inland and coastal markets. Partially offsetting the increase were unusually poor operating conditions due to heavy fog along the Gulf Coast, prolonged periods of ice on the Illinois River, high water on the Mississippi River System, closures of key waterways as a result of lock maintenance projects, extended delays in the Houston Ship Channel, and increased shipyard days on several large capacity coastal vessels during the 2019 first and fourth quarters. For 2019 and 2018, the inland tank barge fleet contributed 77% and 76%, respectively, and the coastal fleet 23% and 24%, respectively, of marine transportation revenues. The Cenac fleet was quickly integrated into the Company’s own fleet and the Cenac equipment began to operate on the Company’s contracts soon after the acquisition and Cenac barges worked with the Company’s towboats and vice versa resulting in differences in vessel utilization and pricing among individual assets and the consolidated fleet. Due to this quick integration, it is not practical to provide a specific amount of revenues for Cenac but the acquisition in March 2019 was one of the factors that drove increases in marine transportation revenues in 2019 as compared to 2018.",
        "Tank barge utilization levels in the Company’s inland marine transportation markets averaged the mid-90% range during both the 2019 first and second quarters and low 90% range during both the 2019 third and fourth quarters. Strong demand from petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals customers, along with extensive delay days due to poor operating conditions which slowed the transport of customer cargoes, contributed to increased barge utilization during the 2019 first and second quarters. Better weather during the 2019 third quarter and receding flood waters on the Mississippi River System resulted in fewer delay days and contributed to modestly lower barge utilization during the 2019 third quarter. In the 2019 fourth quarter, weather conditions seasonally deteriorated, however, reduced refinery and chemical plant utilization for many of the Company’s major customers resulted in tank barge utilization remaining in the low 90% range for the quarter.",

The improvement in barge utilization in 2019 primarily reflected improved customer demand resulting in higher barge utilization in the spot market. Barge utilization in the coastal marine fleet continued to be impacted by the oversupply of smaller tank barges in the coastal industry.",
        "The petrochemical market, the Company’s largest market, contributed 54% of marine transportation revenues for 2019, reflecting continued stable volumes from Gulf Coast petrochemical plants for both domestic consumption and to terminals for export destinations, and the addition of the Targa pressure barge fleet in May 2018. Low priced domestic natural gas, a basic feedstock for the United States petrochemical industry, provides the industry with a competitive advantage relative to naphtha-based foreign petrochemical producers. In addition, favorable commodity prices and the addition of new petrochemical industry capacity in 2018 and 2019 benefited the market.",

Discount rates are determined annually and are based on a yield curve that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the projected benefit cash flows. The Company used discount rates of 2.8% for the Kirby pension plan and 2.9% for the Higman pension plan in 2020 and 3.5% for each plan in 2019, in determining its benefit obligations. The Company estimates that every 0.1% decrease in the discount rate results in an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) of approximately $8,631,000. The Company assumed that plan assets would generate a long-term rate of return of 6.75% and 7.0% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company developed its expected long-term rate of return assumption by evaluating input from investment consultants and comparing historical returns for various asset classes with its actual and targeted plan investments.

        "The Company generated net cash provided by operating activities of $444,940,000, $511,813,000, and $346,999,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The decline in 2020 was driven by decreased revenues and operating income in both the marine transportation and distribution and services segments. The decrease in the marine transportation segment was driven by decreased barge utilization in the inland and coastal markets and decreased term and spot contract pricing in the inland market, each as a result of a reduction in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the Savage acquisition in April 2020 and the Cenac acquisition in March 2019. The decline was also partially offset by changes in certain operating assets and liabilities primarily related to reduced incentive compensation payouts in the 2020 first quarter and a larger decrease in trade accounts receivable compared to 2019, driven by reduced business activity levels in both the marine transportation and distribution and services segments. In addition, during 2020, the Company received a tax refund of $30,606,000 for its 2018 tax return related to net operating losses being carried back to offset taxable income generated during 2013. During February 2021, the Company received a tax refund of $119,493,000, including accrued interest, for its 2019 tax return.",
        "The increase in 2019 was driven by increased revenues and operating income in the marine transportation segment driven by the acquisitions of the Higman fleet in February 2018, the Targa fleet in May 2018, the CGBM barges in December 2018, and the Cenac fleet in March 2019, as well as improved barge utilization in the coastal market and higher spot and term pricing in the inland and coastal markets. The increase was also due to a net increase in cash flows from the change in operating assets and liabilities of $153,953,000, primarily due to a decrease in inventories reflecting reduced business activity levels in the distribution and services segment in 2019 compared to an increase in 2018.",
        "Funds generated from operations are available for acquisitions, capital expenditure projects, common stock repurchases, repayments of borrowings and for other corporate and operating requirements. In addition to net cash flow provided by operating activities, as of February 19, 2021, the Company had cash equivalents of $69,014,000, availability of $704,937,000 under its Revolving Credit Facility and $8,829,000 available under its Credit Line.",
        "Neither the Company, nor any of its subsidiaries, is obligated on any debt instrument, swap agreement, or any other financial instrument or commercial contract which has a rating trigger, except for pricing grids on its Credit Agreement.",
        "The Company expects to continue to fund expenditures for acquisitions, capital construction projects, common stock repurchases, repayment of borrowings, and for other operating requirements from a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operating activities and available financing arrangements.",
        "The Revolving Credit Facility’s commitment is in the amount of $850,000,000 and expires March 27, 2024. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $594,937,000 available under the Revolving Credit Facility. The 3.29% senior unsecured notes do not mature until February 27, 2023, and require no prepayments. The 4.2% senior unsecured notes do not mature until March 1, 2028 and require no prepayments. The outstanding balance of the Term Loan is subject to quarterly installments, currently beginning September 30, 2023, with $343,750,000 due on March 27, 2024. The Term Loan is prepayable, in whole or in part, without penalty.",
        "There are numerous factors that may negatively impact the Company’s cash flow in 2021. For a list of significant risks and uncertainties that could impact cash flows, see Note 14, Contingencies and Commitments in the financial statements, and Item 1A — Risk Factors. Amounts available under the Company’s existing financing arrangements are subject to the Company continuing to meet the covenants of the credit facilities as described in Note 5, Long-Term Debt in the financial statements.",
        "The Company has issued guaranties or obtained standby letters of credit and performance bonds supporting performance by the Company and its subsidiaries of contractual or contingent legal obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries incurred in the ordinary course of business. The aggregate notional value of these instruments is $23,180,000 at December 31, 2020, including $13,586,000 in letters of credit and $9,594,000 in performance bonds. All of these instruments have an expiration date within three years. The Company does not believe demand for payment under these instruments is likely and expects no material cash outlays to occur in connection with these instruments.",

        "All of the Company’s marine transportation term contracts contain fuel escalation clauses, or the customer pays for the fuel. However, there is generally a 30 to 90 day delay before contracts are adjusted depending on the specific contract. In general, the fuel escalation clauses are effective over the long-term in allowing the Company to recover changes in fuel costs due to fuel price changes. However, the short-term effectiveness of the fuel escalation clauses can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, specific terms of the fuel escalation formulas, fuel price volatility, navigating conditions, tow sizes, trip routing, and the location of loading and discharge ports that may result in the Company over or under recovering its fuel costs. The Company’s spot contract rates generally reflect current fuel prices at the time the contract is signed but do not have escalators for fuel.",
        "During the last three years, inflation has had a relatively minor effect on the financial results of the Company. The marine transportation segment has long-term contracts which generally contain cost escalation clauses whereby certain costs, including fuel as noted above, can be passed through to its customers. Spot contract rates include the cost of fuel and are subject to market volatility. The repair portion of the distribution and services segment is based on prevailing current market rates.",

        "The Company’s pension plan funding strategy is to make annual contributions in amounts equal to or greater than amounts necessary to meet minimum government funding requirements. The ABO is based on a variety of demographic and economic assumptions, and the pension plan assets’ returns are subject to various risks, including market and interest rate risk, making an accurate prediction of the pension plan contribution difficult resulting in the Company electing to only make an expected pension contribution forecast of one year. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s pension plan funding was 82% of the pension plans’ ABO, including the Higman pension plan. The Company expects to make additional pension contributions of $2,385,000 in 2021.",

The outstanding loan balances under the Company’s bank credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based on prevailing short-term interest rates in the United States and Europe. A 1% increase in variable interest rates would impact the 2020 interest expense by $6,250,000 based on balances outstanding at December 31, 2020, and would change the fair value of the Company’s debt by approximately 3%.",
