        "HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT",
        "FLIR’s approach to human capital management is guided by The FLIR Method, which establishes the foundation of our strategic priorities to fuel, feed, and focus the business.  TFM consists of the following six elements: Talent Development, Lean Management, One FLIR, Acquisition and Integration Discipline, Continuous Improvement, and Customer-Driven Innovation. By continuously improving our global operations through TFM, we aim to self-fund many of the investments required over our strategic horizon and maximize the efficiency of our human capital. We generally have been successful in attracting highly skilled technical, marketing, and management personnel.",
        "Our employees are further guided by the Company’s Code of Ethical Business Conduct, which sets forth our commitment to the principles of honesty, respect, trust and responsibility in all our activities. In their everyday work, employees embody FLIR’s core values to:",
        "Be Bold:  To be creative and innovative.",
        "Be Brave:  To do the right thing, even when it’s hard.",
        "Be Ready:  To be nimble and decisive.",
        "Be Ambitious:  To succeed and exceed expectations. ",
        "While we seek to foster shared values and a One FLIR culture, our employees are located all over the world, appreciate different perspectives and embrace opportunities to work with those of diverse backgrounds. We are dedicated to a culture that values and respects differences in race, gender, age, religion and identity. As of December31, 2020, we had 4,179 employees, of which 2,231 were located in the United States and 1,948 were located outside of the United States. No employees in the United States are represented by a union or other bargaining group. Certain employees in Europe are represented by a union whose contract is subject to periodic renegotiations. We also recognize works councils in certain European countries. We believe our relationships with our employees, unions and works councils are strong.",
        "We both value our employees’ feedback and invest in their training. In 2020, 73 percent of employees participated in our annual employee survey, which seeks employee feedback to better understand and improve the employee experience and identify opportunities to strengthen our culture. In addition, in 2020, 50 percent of employees participated in learning and development activities which aim to promote FLIR values, reinforce knowledge of key compliance areas, and foster employees’ career development.",
        "We also believe that the physical health, financial wellbeing, life balance and mental health of our employees is vital to FLIR’s success. FLIR invests in onsite fitness centers, provides a health club reimbursement through our fitness subsidy program and offers its employees various incentives and opportunities to participate in certain health-focused activities. In 2020, over 300 employees received flu shots sponsored by FLIR and 59 percent of eligible employees participated in the U.S. Employee Wellness Incentive Program and earned a total of approximately $0.1 million in incentives to offset their medical premiums in 2021. FLIR also provided its employees with various opportunities to participate in wellness events in 2020, such as the FLIR Wellness Amazing Race Step Challenge in the fourth quarter, with approximately 550 participants on 101 teams taking over a collective 142 million steps, and the FLIR Runs Wild 5K event in the second quarter in which over 330 employees participated globally to raise $13,300 for the World Wildlife Fund. In response to the devastation of the wildfires in Oregon in 2020, FLIR matched contributions of $25,000 for a GoFundMe campaign for employees who were adversely impacted. Of course, maintaining the health and safety of our employees across the globe has been a key focus since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of our safety protocols and other measures adopted to protect our employees’ health and safety while continuing to meet and exceed customers’ expectations.",
