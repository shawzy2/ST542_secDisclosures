We are committed to recruiting the most qualified people for the job regardless of gender, ethnicity or other protected traits and to comply fully with all domestic, foreign and local laws relating to discrimination in the workplace. Additionally, we believe in providing opportunities for career progression for our people and as such, establish goals of filling open positions with internal talent. Crawford is committed to improving the diversity of our workforce and has affirmative action plans as required for our largest locations in the U.S. We launched our Office of Inclusion & Diversity in early 2020 and subsequently formed a global diversity council to work with our executive and country leadership teams to enhance our inclusion and diversity policies and practices. Two of our key accomplishments for 2020 were delivering unconscious bias training to our executive leadership team, managers and employees and launching two employee resource groups in the U.S. "
