        "Diversity and inclusion are fundamental to our success. Our commitment to diversity starts at the top with our highly skilled and diverse Board of Directors. We are one of the few large public companies with both a female CEO and a female independent Board Chairperson. Our D&I efforts are overseen by our Boardâ€™s Compensation Committee, and those efforts are implemented at all levels of the organization. ",

        "We seek to maintain a fair and inclusive work environment to have our employees reflect the customers we serve and our leaders reflect the people they lead. We publish employee and manager demographic information on our website and update this on an annual basis. We support D&I awareness among our employees through formal training sessions and workshops focused on building our cultural competency and addressing difficult topics such as racial inequality, microinequities, and privilege. We also have nine employee resource groups (African American Network, Asian American Network, Disabilities Awareness Network, Latin American Networking Association, LGBTQ+ Network, Military Network, Network of Empowered Women, Parent Connection and Young Professionals Network) intended to build a community for our employees with common backgrounds, life experiences, and professional challenges. We leverage our extensive contemporary art collection to spark conversations about our culture, innovation, ethical obligations, and respecting our differences. "
