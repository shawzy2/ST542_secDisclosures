        "We believe a workplace that encourages different voices, perspectives and backgrounds creates better teams, better solutions and more innovation. For the past several years, we have strived to create a culture of inclusion, reduce bias in our talent practices, and invest in and engage with our communities. We are focused on the following three key areas:",
        "Our workplace: who we are and how it feels to work at Masco",
        "Our communities: how we can help increase access, equity, and inclusion with our diverse community partners",
        "Our marketplace: how we represent our consumers and use our buying power to support advancing economic equity",
        "We are refining strategic objectives and expectations within each of these focus areas. We are also developing multiple internal channels to increase communication and opportunity for engagement among our employees. In 2020, we established a global, enterprise DE&I Council and several local councils and employee resource groups at our business units and our corporate headquarters to help implement action plans tailored to their specific needs and challenges."
