        "Diversity: We strive to create diverse and inclusive workplaces where all our team members can perform to their full potential. We place particular emphasis on developing our people and building a deep and diverse talent pool to ensure Manitowocâ€™s sustained success over the long-term. As stewards of our diversity and inclusion initiatives, our leadership team takes a proactive approach to build and develop a diverse pipeline of talent. Formed in 2019, the Future Leader Mentoring Program is an 18-month program partnering our key talent with executive leadership, to develop talent and identify our future leaders from within the enterprise. The first wave of this program was designed to accelerate the development of female leaders in the organization, increase retention, and create a strong pool of talent to take on more prominent roles in the future."
