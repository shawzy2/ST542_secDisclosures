        "WashREIT’s Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging Initiative (\"DEIB\") is a long-term commitment to promote an environment where each individual feels comfortable being their most authentic selves. We believe diversity of backgrounds, experiences, cultures, ethnicities, and interests leads to new ways of thinking and drives organizational success. Our diverse 17 member DEIB Council is overseen by WashREIT’s senior leadership team and Board of Trustees. The DEIB Council both tracks and monitors our diversity metrics and facilitates learning and training opportunities that include: Diversity Speaker Series, targeted recruitment and relationship development of historically black colleges and universities and other diverse industry groups for internships, annual inclusion and belonging employee survey, partnership with diverse local non-profit to provide tutoring for school aged children among others."
