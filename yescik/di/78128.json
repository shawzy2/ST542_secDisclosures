            "Diversity of backgrounds, ideas, thoughts, and experiences is essential to our culture and the way we do business.  Creating an environment where our differences are valued and where every person feels a sense of belonging and engagement supports a thriving organization that cares about our customers.  In 2019 and 2020 our Company conducted education and unconscious bias workshops to foster better understanding of points of view and how pre-conceived notions impact relationships at work. Diversifying the workforce continues to be a focus at all levels of the Company. Our diversity hiring for the organization grew by more than 7% from 2019. Diversity at the management level has also grown, with 7% of the management team comprised of minorities and 23% of the management team comprised of women by the end of 2020.",
            "We recognize an opportunity to strengthen the diversity in our company. Based on local customer demographic data, we are focused on increasing the diversity of our employee demographics to reflect the diversity in the communities that we serve. We have a range of diverse recruitment tactics and believe we can achieve our multiyear plan of reaching 17% employees of color."
