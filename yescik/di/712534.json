        ":  We believe in attracting, retaining and promoting a diverse workforce.  2020 marked the beginning of several Diversity Equity and Inclusion (\"DEI\") initiatives aimed at promoting the career growth and engagement of all First Merchants employees.  Our largest employee resource group (First Women Connections) expanded as it continues to promote the careers of women in the Corporation.  The creation of a DEI Employee Council is attended by nearly 100 employees every two weeks and the formation of a DEI Steering Committee was established to provide clear direction and set priorities around our efforts to further our successes of our increasingly diverse organization.
