        "We strive to be an inclusive workplace where our employees reflect the community, are valued, find purpose in their work, and grow and contribute to their fullest potential.  We are broadening investments in social areas, including Diversity and Inclusion and racial and gender equity. We launched two task forces, one on Social Justice and Racial Equity, and the other focused on Gender Equity. Our goal for 2027 is to have Black/African American representation in our U.S. workforce to be 14 percent and female representation to be 50 percent of our global workforce across all regions and job levels. The company has developed new global policies and practices to attract and hire talented individuals from underrepresented minorities. For every new hire we now require diverse candidate slates and multiple dimensions of diversity represented by each interview panel. We are expanding our applicant pools and pipelines by adding a new Human Resource role for diversity talent sourcing and partnering with an external recruiting agency specializing in diverse hiring. Diverse views, backgrounds and experiences are key to our success. We launched three additional Employee Resource Groups (\"ERGs\") in 2019. FMC has six total ERGs with more than twenty employee resource group chapters. We scored 100 percent on the Human Rights Campaign Foundationâ€™s 2021 Corporate Equality Index, a U.S. benchmarking survey measuring corporate policies and practices related to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (\"LGBTQ\") workplace equality. This is our second consecutive year receiving a score of 100 percent. Over the past several years, we have had significant policy changes related to parental leave and domestic partner and transgender inclusion benefits in the U.S. Due to our diversity and inclusion strategy, women in senior management positions increased from 32 percent in 2019 to 34 percent in 2020."
