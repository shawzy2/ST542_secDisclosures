        ".  We believe a diverse workforce and culture of inclusion is essential to drive innovation, fuel growth and help ensure our technologies and products effectively serve a global customer base.  Danaher’s Diversity + Inclusion Council (including Danaher’s Senior Vice President of Human Resources, Vice President of Diversity + Inclusion and multiple other executive officers) oversees the development and execution of our diversity and inclusion (“D+I”) strategy.  We focus on broadening our candidate pools, sourcing diverse slates in the hiring process and implementing and sustaining programs (such as our U.S.-based Associate Resource Groups for Women, Black, Latinx, LGBTQ and Asian descent associates) that offer mentorship, support and engagement to help our associates, including those from underrepresented groups,  succeed and thrive.  In support of our D+I commitment, we conduct regular pay reviews from a race (in the United States.) and gender (globally) perspective that serve to proactively identify and address potential pay differences.  As of December 31, 2020, 36% of our total associates were female; 29% of our managerial associates were female; 33% of our total U.S. associates were People of Color; and 25% of our U.S. managerial associates were People of Color.
