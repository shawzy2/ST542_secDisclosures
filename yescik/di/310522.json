            "We seek to foster an environment in which all employees are treated with dignity and respect, have the opportunity to contribute to meaningful work, and perform that work in an inclusive environment free from discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. We believe this commitment helps us attract and retain a skilled, diverse workforce. As of December 31, 2020, racial or ethnic minorities constituted 55% of our overall workforce and 24% of our officer-level employees, and women constituted 44% of our overall workforce and 37% of our officer-level employees. Supporting our role in the secondary mortgage market requires employees with specialized technology skills. As a result, we consider our workforce diversity in the context of fintech companies, whose operations are based on a blend of financial services products and technology platforms, rather than financial services firms or other companies that have significant retail operations or a large number of administrative roles. We sponsor programs and activities to cultivate a diverse and inclusive work environment by focusing on inclusive leadership principles, talent development, enterprise accessibility, team and group dynamics, and a consistent communications strategy that reinforces the practice of driving inclusion to achieve innovative solutions. We also support voluntary, grassroots employee resource groups that are open to all employees, support diversity and inclusion, and provide a forum for members to come together for professional growth and development, cultural awareness, education, community service, and networking across the organization. In 2020, our senior management also sponsored a series of “Courageous Conversations” to facilitate safe-space discussions for employees to gain an understanding of and share differing viewpoints on issues related to social justice."
