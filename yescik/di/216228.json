            "Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion are critical business priorities for ITT. We value and leverage the differences that make each of us unique. We are focused on demonstrating our commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion through our actions, including creating an environment where all ITTers are able to fully engage and achieve their potential, and freely share ideas to guide us toward more innovative thinking and better business decisions and solutions. We value diversity in our employee population, including diversity in race, religion, gender, disability, nationality, age, sexual orientation, ethnic background, and more. For additional information along with our diversity metrics and statistics, please refer to our June 2020 Sustainability Supplement report found on our website. We firmly believe that we will create more success by leveraging our collective know-how and continuously learning from each other's diverse ideas, opinions and experiences. We believe that creating a diverse environment allows us to generate bold thinking that will sustain and propel our success in the global marketplace and create long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders.
