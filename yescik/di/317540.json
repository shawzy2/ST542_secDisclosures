        "We strive to cultivate diversity in our workforce and believe teammates with diverse backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints bring value to our organization. In 2020, we launched a diversity task force comprised of diverse teammates from across the organization and led by our President and Chief Operating Officer in order to enhance our focus on cultivating diversity at Coca‑Cola Consolidated. This task force helped develop a diversity framework focused on four pillars – communication, accountability, empowerment and partnerships. Each member of our senior executive leadership team is hosting similar discussion groups around the Company. The task force and these discussion groups strive to enhance Company-wide engagement on diversity and inclusion, provide opportunities for teammates to discuss diversity and inclusion, develop initiatives to support our diversity framework and monitor progress across these initiatives."
