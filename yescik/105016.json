        "As of December31, 2020, we employed approximately 5,800 full-time employees, substantially all of whom were non-union employees. Of these employees, approximately 10% were located in Canada and Mexico. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel in the normal course of business to supplement our workforce. As the largest distributor of HVAC/R equipment and related parts and supplies in North America, we have a wide variety of employees. Given the breadth of our employee base, we tailor our human capital management policies with a view to specific employee populations. However, we provide a wide variety of opportunities for professional growth and talent development for all employees, including online trainings, on-the-job experience, and education tuition assistance.
