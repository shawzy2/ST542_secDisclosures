        "Our Employees",
        "At year-end 2020, we had approximately 20,400 employees, of which 15,100 were engaged in production and 11,400 were international employees (including 5,700 in Asia and 2,600 in Europe). Of these employees, 7,100 were in Bedding Products, 7,700 were in Specialized Products, and 4,800 were in Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products, with the remainder at our corporate office or in other roles.

Management is not aware of circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2021",
        "Our Ability to Attract, Recruit, and Retain Employees",

Additionally, in the U.S. and Canada, our employees are eligible to participate in discount stock purchase plans.

        "Employee Engagement",
        "At many of our locations, we analyze employee satisfaction and attempt to enhance engagement and mitigate related risks. We periodically conduct employee surveys at certain operations to evaluate the employee relations environment. Voluntary employee turnover data is gathered and analyzed. The results of surveys and data analyses are used to assess human capital risks and identify opportunities for more meaningful employee engagement. From this analysis, action plans are developed, and branch-level initiatives are adopted to improve engagement and reduce turnover. We also engage with our employees through our Ethics Hotline, which serves as a grievance-reporting mechanism.  Employees can express concerns, confidentially and anonymously, regarding possible violations of ethics, law, or our policies",
        "Turnover Rates",
        "We rely on a diverse workforce to sustain our strategies and deliver our results of operations. In order to achieve our goals, this workforce must be stable. In 2020, our voluntary turnover rate in the U.S. was 17.3%, which we believe is reasonably comparable to average voluntary turnover rates of manufacturers in the industries in which we operate",
        "Our Inclusion, Diversity and Equity",
        "We continue to foster a culture of inclusion, diversity, and equity in which everyone is respected, valued, and has an equal opportunity to contribute, thrive, and advance.

The team established long-term strategies and action plans designed to: (i) ensure that we have a safe and inclusive workplace; (ii) equip our people to attract, develop, retain, and reward a diverse and inclusive workforce; (iii) be an inclusive and equitable corporate citizen; (iv) develop a governance and accountability model that will sustain inclusion and diversity; and (v) enhance our business results",
        "Equal Opportunity",
        "We are committed to equal opportunity and base workplace decisions solely on merit, qualifications, and other job-related, neutral, non-discriminatory criteria. We provide equal employment opportunity without regard to age, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, citizenship, pregnancy, religion, disability, military status, genetic information, or other status protected by law.

We developed a comprehensive handbook to set and communicate work procedures and changes to production necessary to facilitate COVID-19 health and safety measures, including proper social distancing. Our business leaders have implemented training and change management initiatives to drive and maintain new ways of operating. When employees test positive for COVID-19, we follow adopted procedures including enhanced disinfecting that targets applicable areas. The affected employee is required to observe a quarantine period, monitor symptoms, and follow medical guidance prior to returning to work. Contact tracing is performed to identify employees who had direct contact with the affected employee. If direct contacts are identified, those employees must self-isolate, monitor symptoms, and follow medical guidance prior to returning to work",
        "Workplace Safety",
        "We are also dedicated to the safety of our employees through prevention, education, and awareness with the objective of reducing, or even eliminating, workplace injuries through accident investigation and process safety.  Our dedicated staff of professionals supports safety management at our manufacturing facilities, including implementation of a comprehensive program called “SafeGuard.” The SafeGuard program develops relevant job hazard analyses, which are",

        "Continuing Education and Training",
        "Developing Our Talent",
        "Although some of our established learning and development programs, as disclosed below, were less active during 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, they continue to be part of our ongoing, long-term strategy, which is focused on growing talent throughout all levels of our organization, including technical/skilled positions, supervisory and management levels, and future leaders",
        "Frontline Supervisor Training Program",

        "Succession Development",
        "Management and Leadership Positions",
        "Our commitment to having strong managers and leadership in critical roles across the company continues to serve us well. Our values and culture guide our talent initiatives which are designed to create a pipeline of strong, high performing leadership candidates to serve in progressively important roles throughout the Company. Our internal promotion rate over the last three years for corporate officer positions was 89%. We are building on our success in these areas and continue to push our succession development processes to new levels to allow us to adapt and grow"
