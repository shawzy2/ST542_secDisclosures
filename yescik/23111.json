With our continued commitment to monitor, assess and implement guidance and best practices for the Company as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we have been able to maintain the continuity of the essential services that we provide to our clients, while also managing the impact of the spread of the virus within our business, as well as promoting the health, well-being and safety of our employees, clients and communities",
