        "The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) implemented a broad range of corporate governance, accounting and reporting reforms for companies that have securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act established, among other things: (i) new requirements for audit and other key Board of Directors committees involving independence, expertise levels, and specified responsibilities; (ii) additional responsibilities regarding the oversight of financial statements by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company; (iii) the creation of an independent accounting oversight board for the accounting industry; (iv) new standards for auditors and the regulation of audits, including independence provisions which restrict non-audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients; (v) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive officers including accelerated reporting of company stock transactions; (vi) a prohibition of personal loans to directors and officers, except certain loans made by insured financial institutions on non-preferential terms and in compliance with other bank regulator requirements; and (vii) a range of new and increased civil and criminal penalties for fraud and other violations of the securities laws.",
        "Electronic Fund Transfer Act",
        "Among other provisions, the federal banking rule under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act prohibits financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machines and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. The rule does not govern overdraft fees on the payment of checks and certain other forms of bill payments.",
        "Community Reinvestment Act of 1977",
        "Under the CRA, the Bank is required to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Although the Bank must follow the requirements of CRA, it does not limit the Bank’s discretion to develop products and services that are suitable for a particular community or establish lending requirements or programs. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in lending practices. The Bank’s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of the Company. The Bank’s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions against it by its regulators as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. The Bank’s latest CRA rating was “Satisfactory”.",

        "The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as currency transaction and suspicious activity reporting), as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements. The Company has established a bank secrecy act /anti-money laundering program and taken other appropriate measures in order to comply with BSA requirements.",

Of our approximately 20,000 employees, approximately 8,300 were employed in our International segment. In our Americas segment, the majority of our employees are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. In our International segment, we enter into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. Many of our employees are covered by a variety of union contracts and governmental regulations affecting, among other things, compensation, job retention rights and pensions.",

We understand benefits are a key element to a total reward package, so ensuring we provide meaningful benefit programs and resources across the globe is an integral part of how we reward employees, including with respect to healthcare and retirement. As a global company, benefits will vary by country to reflect local practices and cultures, but our commitment to providing comprehensive and meaningful benefits and resources is consistent across the world.  We continuously review and, when necessary, update our programs to ensure they remain flexible, competitive, and aligned to what is important for our employees and their families. ",
        "Global Gender Pay Equity",
        "To ensure we are compensating both men and women employees fairly and equitably, we transitioned to a global Center of Excellence total rewards function five years ago with the aim to standardize and harmonize our rewards programs across all countries. As a result, we have established pay programs that provide for equal incentive pay opportunity for all employees in same or similar positions across the globe. Additionally, we utilize global guidelines and standards to inform compensation decisions for all new hires and promotions. To monitor our performance for our management employees, we evaluate base salary placement relative to our internal salary ranges for men and women. For our hourly field workforce (non-management employees), we maintain pay equity through our standardized compensation practices in which all employees begin at the same start rate, based on their location and position, and annual pay increases are applied consistently to all employees based on tenure.",

We strive to have a diverse and inclusive work environment where co-workers feel valued for their uniqueness, recognized for their diverse talents, and where they can bring their whole selves to work. We have created employee resource groups (“ERGs”), company-sponsored group comprised of employees from diverse backgrounds that advocate equality, opportunities for advancement, and facilitate discussion around best practices and resources to more targeted cultural and racial understanding and diversity. These ERGs provide a space where employees can foster connections and develop in a supportive environment.

Consistent with our operating philosophy, we are committed to safety and our core belief is that health and safety is every employee’s responsibility, not only for our employees but for our customers, vendors, and all stakeholders. We currently collect incident rates to track safety performance for our United States operations, which represents our largest employee population. In addition to numerous proactive actions taken to ensure employee safety, our focus is also evident in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the launch of the Avis Safety Pledge and the Budget Worry-Free Promise to help provide a safe and convenient rental experience by enhancing our cleaning protocols. We contracted with a council of medical professionals to provide feedback and consultation on our safety protocols and practices. In addition, we partnered with an organization that creates innovative behavioral based training to ensure our staff is properly skilled and educated on safety related to the pandemic. In response to COVID-19, we have also added work-from-home flexibility for employees who can work remotely; implemented temperature screening of employees at the majority of our locations in the United States; established new physical distancing procedures; provided additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies; modified certain work spaces with plexiglass dividers; implemented protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure; and required masks to be worn in all locations where allowed by local law. We will continue to provide our staff with hand sanitizer, gloves and masks and conduct daily health self-assessments before shifts where we are permitted to do so. We will continue to offer an enhanced sick leave policy and offer employees COVID-19 testing free of charge.",

The general effect of the law was to establish a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms, and other financial service providers.

United has a cross-functional Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council (“DE&I Council”) to advise executive and senior leadership on the Company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy and to implement and manage programs to accomplish and support these priorities.

Supporting our community is a top priority for United and its employees. United Bank employees performed over 18,000 hours of community service in 2020 as well as an additional 78,800 hours processing PPP loans to help out our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. United has been recognized for its bank-wide financial literacy programs, including its own Bank at Work and Premier Partners programs, as well as its participation in the American Bankers Association’s America Saves Week and Teach Children to Save campaigns. United promotes and supports volunteer work by its employees by providing paid time off for bank sponsored volunteer work during the workday or personal paid leave for volunteer work that is not bank sponsored.  We pride ourselves on our commitment to meeting the needs of our employees and the communities we serve, helping to fuel opportunities and combat any challenges. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our primary objective was to protect the health, safety, happiness, and well-being of our employees, while continuing to provide the best possible services for our customers.  Competition  United faces a high degree of competition in all of the markets it serves. We face strong competition in gathering deposits, making loans and obtaining client assets for management by our investment or trust operations. United considers all of West Virginia to be included in its market area. This area includes the five largest West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Areas (“MSA”): the Parkersburg MSA, the Charleston MSA, the Huntington    9       Table of Contents    MSA, the Morgantown MSA and the Wheeling MSA. United serves the Ohio counties of Lawrence, Belmont, Jefferson and Washington and Fayette county in Pennsylvania primarily because of their close proximity to the Ohio and Pennsylvania borders and United banking offices located in those counties or in nearby West Virginia. United’s Virginia markets include the Maryland, northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. MSA, the Winchester MSA, the Harrisonburg MSA, and the Charlottesville MSA. Through its acquisition of Carolina Financial, United’s market now also includes the Coastal, Midlands, and Upstate regions of South Carolina, including the Charleston (Charleston, Dorchester and Berkeley Counties), Myrtle Beach (Horry and Georgetown Counties), Columbia (Richland and Lexington Counties), and the Upstate (Greenville and Spartanburg Counties) areas as well as areas in North Carolina including Wilmington (New Hanover County), Raleigh-Durham (Durham and Wake Counties), Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia (NC and SC) and the southeastern coastal region of North Carolina (Bladen, Brunswick, Columbus, Cumberland, Duplin and Robeson Counties).United considers all of the above locations to be the primary market area for the business of its banking and mortgage banking subsidiaries.  With prior regulatory approval, Virginia banks are permitted unlimited branch banking throughout each state. In addition, interstate acquisitions of and by Virginia banks and bank holding companies are permissible on a reciprocal basis, as well as reciprocal interstate acquisitions by thrift institutions. These conditions serve to intensify competition within United’s market.  As of December 31, 2020, there were 58 bank holding companies operating in the State of West Virginia registered with the Federal Reserve System and the West Virginia Board of Banking and Financial Institutions, 92 bank holding companies operating in the Commonwealth of Virginia registered with the Federal Reserve System and the Virginia State Corporation Commission, 59 bank holding companies operating in the State of North Carolina registered with the Federal Reserve System and the N.C. Office of the Commissioner of Banks and 61 bank holding companies operating in the State of South Carolina registered with the Federal Reserve System and the South Carolina State Board of Financial Institutions. These holding companies are headquartered in various states and control banks throughout West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, which compete for business as well as for the acquisition of additional banks  Regulation and Supervision  United, as a financial holding company, is subject to the restrictions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is registered pursuant to its provisions. As such, United is subject to the reporting requirements of and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Board of Governors”).  The Bank Holding Company Act prohibits the acquisition by a bank holding company of direct or indirect ownership of more than five percent of the voting shares of any bank within the United States without prior approval of the Board of Governors. With certain exceptions, a bank holding company also is prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank, and from engaging directly or indirectly in business unrelated to the business of banking, or managing or controlling banks.  The Board of Governors, in its Regulation Y, permits financial holding companies to engage in preapproved non-banking activities closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks. Approval of the Board of Governors is necessary to engage in certain other non-banking activities which are not preapproved or to make acquisitions of corporations engaging in these activities. In addition, on a case-by-case basis, the Board of Governors may approve other non-banking activities. A financial holding company may also engage in financial activities, including securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting activities, and merchant banking activities.  As a financial holding company doing business in West Virginia, United is also subject to regulation and examination by the West Virginia Board of Banking and Financial Institutions (the “West Virginia Banking Board”) and must submit annual reports to the West Virginia Banking Board. Further, any acquisition application that United must submit to the Board of Governors must also be submitted to the West Virginia Banking Board for approval.    10       Table of Contents    The Board of Governors has broad authority to prohibit activities of financial holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations. The Board of Governors also can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as $1 million for each day the activity continues.  United Bank, as a Virginia state member bank, is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve System, and as such, are subject to applicable provisions of the Federal Reserve Act and regulations issued thereunder. United Bank is subject to the Virginia banking statutes and regulations, and is primarily regulated by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions. As a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), United Bank’s deposits are insured as required by federal law. Bank regulatory authorities regularly examine revenues, loans, investments, management practices, and other aspects of United Bank. These examinations are conducted primarily to protect depositors and not shareholders. In addition to these regular examinations, United Bank must furnish to regulatory authorities quarterly reports containing full and accurate statements of its affairs.  United is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC and certain state securities commissions in regard to the offering and sale of its securities. Generally, United must file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended, to issue additional shares of its common stock. United is also registered under and is subject to the regulatory and disclosure requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. United is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the quotation symbol “UBSI,” and is subject to the rules of the NASDAQ for listed companies.  SEC regulations require us to disclose certain types of business and financial data on a regular basis to the SEC and to our shareholders. We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. We prepare and file an annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC that contains detailed financial and operating information, as well as a management response to specific questions about United’s operations. SEC regulations require that our annual reports to shareholders contain certified financial statements and other specific items such as management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. We must also file quarterly reports with the SEC on Form 10-Q that contain detailed financial and operating information for the prior quarter and we must file current reports on Form 8-K to provide the pubic with information on recent material events.  In addition to periodic reporting to the SEC, we are subject to proxy rules and tender offer rules issued by the SEC. Our officers, directors and principal shareholders (holding 10% or more of our stock) must also submit reports to the SEC regarding their holdings of our stock and any changes to such holdings, and they are subject to short-swing profit liability.  Dividends and Stock Repurchases  The principal source of United’s liquidity is dividends from United Bank. The prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required if the total of all dividends declared by a state-chartered member bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the bank’s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock. Federal law also prohibits a state-chartered, member bank from paying dividends that would be greater than the bank’s undivided profits. United Bank is also subject to limitations under Virginia state law regarding the level of dividends that may be paid.  In addition, United and United Bank are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or    11       Table of Contents      unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The appropriate federal regulatory authorities have stated that paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In addition, in the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.   In July 2019, the federal bank regulators adopted final rules (the “Capital Simplifications Rules”) that, among other things, eliminated the standalone prior approval requirement in the Basel III Capital Rules for any repurchase of common stock. In certain circumstances, United’s repurchases of its common stock may be subject to a prior approval or notice requirement under other regulations, policies or supervisory expectations of the Federal Reserve Board. Any redemption or repurchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt remains subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010  On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), into law. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changes regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes, among other things, provisions creating a Financial Services Oversight Council to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation; centralizing the responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws; permanently raising the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000; establishing strengthened capital standards for banks, and disallowing trust preferred securities as qualifying for Tier 1 capital (subject to certain grandfather provisions for existing trust preferred securities); establishing new minimum mortgage underwriting standards; granting the Federal Reserve Board the power to regulate debit card interchange fees; and implementing corporate governance changes.  On December 10, 2013, the banking agencies issued a final rule implementing Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule”. The Federal Reserve issued an order on December 18, 2014 extending the period which banking entities have to divest disallowed securities under the Volcker Rule to July 21, 2016. The Federal Reserve also announced its intention to grant an additional one year extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2017. On January 14, 2014, the banking agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities (“Trup Cdos”) from the prohibitions under the Volcker Rule. During the third quarter of 2014 United sold four Trup Cdos for a net gain of $1.3 million in response to the Volcker Rule. Under the Volcker Rule, these four securities were identified by United as covered funds and were required to be divested of before July 21, 2017. United has sold its remaining Trup Cdos.  On May 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law the “Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the EGRRCPA Act)” which provides certain limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as certain targeted modifications to other post-financial crisis regulatory requirements. In addition, the legislation establishes new consumer protections and amends various securities- and investment company-related requirements. The EGRRCPA Act primarily amends several other laws, including the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), Federal Credit Union Act, Federal Deposit Insurance Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Securities Act of 1933. The Act is divided into six titles, which aim to: improve consumer access to mortgage credit (Title I); provide regulatory relief and protect consumer access to credit (Title II); protect the credit information of consumers, including veterans and servicemembers (Title III); tailor regulations for certain bank holding companies, including raising the threshold levels for exemption from certain prudential standards and stress testing (Title IV); encourage capital formation by reforming certain Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations (Title V); and protect student borrowers (Title VI).      12       Table of Contents    Deposit Insurance  The deposits of United Bank are insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law. Accordingly, United Bank is also subject to regulation by the FDIC. United Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank’s capital level and supervisory rating (CAMELS rating) and certain financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The risk matrix utilizes four risk categories which are distinguished by capital levels and supervisory ratings.  In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the new restoration plan, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections at least semi-annually for the fund and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking if required.  In April 2011, the FDIC implemented rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act to reform the deposit insurance assessment system. The final rule redefined the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments. Specifically, the rule bases assessments on an institution’s total assets less tangible capital, as opposed to total deposits. Since the new base is larger than the prior base, the FDIC also proposed lowering assessment rates so that the rules would not significantly alter the total amount of revenue collected from the industry. The new assessment scale ranges from 2.5 basis points for the least risky institutions to 45 basis points for the riskiest.  As part of its changes in April 2011, the FDIC established a new methodology for determining assessment rates for large and highly complex institutions, as defined in the rules. In October 2012, the FDIC announced revised changes to some of the definitions used to determine assessment rates for these large and highly complex insured depository institutions. The rule generally applies to FDIC-regulated banks with assets greater than $10 billion and took effect April 1, 2013. In the second quarter of 2018, United Bank was reclassified as a large institution for deposit insurance assessment purposes. Generally, this new classification resulted in higher FDIC insurance premiums.  On September 30, 2018, the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reached 1.36%, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35% ahead of the September 30, 2020, deadline required under the Dodd-Frank Act. FDIC regulations provide for two changes to deposit insurance assessments upon reaching the minimum: (1) surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more (large banks) ceased on December 28, 2018; and (2) small banks will receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between 1.15% and 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38%. United benefited from both these changes.  United’s FDIC insurance expense totaled $10.1 million, $8.1 million, and $11.5 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Capital Requirements  United and United Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve Board (the “Basel III Capital Rules”). Since fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules require United and United Bank to maintain the following:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of 7.0%);       \n\n\n \n•\n \n A minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%);       \n\n\n \n•\n \n A minimum ratio of total capital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%); and       \n\n\n \n•\n \n A minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”).        13       Table of Contents    ",

United Bank employees performed over 18,000 hours of community service in 2020 as well as an additional 78,800 hours processing PPP loans to help out our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. United has been recognized for its bank-wide financial literacy programs, including its own Bank at Work and Premier Partners programs, as well as its participation in the American Bankers Association’s America Saves Week and Teach Children to Save campaigns. United promotes and supports volunteer work by its employees by providing paid time off for bank sponsored volunteer work during the workday or personal paid leave for volunteer work that is not bank sponsored.  We pride ourselves on our commitment to meeting the needs of our employees and the communities we serve, helping to fuel opportunities and combat any challenges. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our primary objective was to protect the health, safety, happiness, and well-being of our employees, while continuing to provide the best possible services for our customers.  Competition  United faces a high degree of competition in all of the markets it serves. We face strong competition in gathering deposits, making loans and obtaining client assets for management by our investment or trust operations. United considers all of West Virginia to be included in its market area. This area includes the five largest West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Areas (“MSA”): the Parkersburg MSA, the Charleston MSA, the Huntington    9       Table of Contents    MSA, the Morgantown MSA and the Wheeling MSA. United serves the Ohio counties of Lawrence, Belmont, Jefferson and Washington and Fayette county in Pennsylvania primarily because of their close proximity to the Ohio and Pennsylvania borders and United banking offices located in those counties or in nearby West Virginia. United’s Virginia markets include the Maryland, northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. MSA, the Winchester MSA, the Harrisonburg MSA, and the Charlottesville MSA. Through its acquisition of Carolina Financial, United’s market now also includes the Coastal, Midlands, and Upstate regions of South Carolina, including the Charleston (Charleston, Dorchester and Berkeley Counties), Myrtle Beach (Horry and Georgetown Counties), Columbia (Richland and Lexington Counties), and the Upstate (Greenville and Spartanburg Counties) areas as well as areas in North Carolina including Wilmington (New Hanover County), Raleigh-Durham (Durham and Wake Counties), Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia (NC and SC) and the southeastern coastal region of North Carolina (Bladen, Brunswick, Columbus, Cumberland, Duplin and Robeson Counties).United considers all of the above locations to be the primary market area for the business of its banking and mortgage banking subsidiaries.  With prior regulatory approval, Virginia banks are permitted unlimited branch banking throughout each state. In addition, interstate acquisitions of and by Virginia banks and bank holding companies are permissible on a reciprocal basis, as well as reciprocal interstate acquisitions by thrift institutions. These conditions serve to intensify competition within United’s market.  As of December 31, 2020, there were 58 bank holding companies operating in the State of West Virginia registered with the Federal Reserve System and the West Virginia Board of Banking and Financial Institutions, 92 bank holding companies operating in the Commonwealth of Virginia registered with the Federal Reserve System and the Virginia State Corporation Commission, 59 bank holding companies operating in the State of North Carolina registered with the Federal Reserve System and the N.C. Office of the Commissioner of Banks and 61 bank holding companies operating in the State of South Carolina registered with the Federal Reserve System and the South Carolina State Board of Financial Institutions. These holding companies are headquartered in various states and control banks throughout West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, which compete for business as well as for the acquisition of additional banks  Regulation and Supervision  United, as a financial holding company, is subject to the restrictions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is registered pursuant to its provisions. As such, United is subject to the reporting requirements of and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Board of Governors”).  The Bank Holding Company Act prohibits the acquisition by a bank holding company of direct or indirect ownership of more than five percent of the voting shares of any bank within the United States without prior approval of the Board of Governors. With certain exceptions, a bank holding company also is prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank, and from engaging directly or indirectly in business unrelated to the business of banking, or managing or controlling banks.  The Board of Governors, in its Regulation Y, permits financial holding companies to engage in preapproved non-banking activities closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks. Approval of the Board of Governors is necessary to engage in certain other non-banking activities which are not preapproved or to make acquisitions of corporations engaging in these activities. In addition, on a case-by-case basis, the Board of Governors may approve other non-banking activities. A financial holding company may also engage in financial activities, including securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting activities, and merchant banking activities.  As a financial holding company doing business in West Virginia, United is also subject to regulation and examination by the West Virginia Board of Banking and Financial Institutions (the “West Virginia Banking Board”) and must submit annual reports to the West Virginia Banking Board. Further, any acquisition application that United must submit to the Board of Governors must also be submitted to the West Virginia Banking Board for approval.    10       Table of Contents    The Board of Governors has broad authority to prohibit activities of financial holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations. The Board of Governors also can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as $1 million for each day the activity continues.  United Bank, as a Virginia state member bank, is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve System, and as such, are subject to applicable provisions of the Federal Reserve Act and regulations issued thereunder. United Bank is subject to the Virginia banking statutes and regulations, and is primarily regulated by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions. As a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), United Bank’s deposits are insured as required by federal law. Bank regulatory authorities regularly examine revenues, loans, investments, management practices, and other aspects of United Bank. These examinations are conducted primarily to protect depositors and not shareholders. In addition to these regular examinations, United Bank must furnish to regulatory authorities quarterly reports containing full and accurate statements of its affairs.  United is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC and certain state securities commissions in regard to the offering and sale of its securities. Generally, United must file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended, to issue additional shares of its common stock. United is also registered under and is subject to the regulatory and disclosure requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. United is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the quotation symbol “UBSI,” and is subject to the rules of the NASDAQ for listed companies.  SEC regulations require us to disclose certain types of business and financial data on a regular basis to the SEC and to our shareholders. We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. We prepare and file an annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC that contains detailed financial and operating information, as well as a management response to specific questions about United’s operations. SEC regulations require that our annual reports to shareholders contain certified financial statements and other specific items such as management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. We must also file quarterly reports with the SEC on Form 10-Q that contain detailed financial and operating information for the prior quarter and we must file current reports on Form 8-K to provide the pubic with information on recent material events.  In addition to periodic reporting to the SEC, we are subject to proxy rules and tender offer rules issued by the SEC. Our officers, directors and principal shareholders (holding 10% or more of our stock) must also submit reports to the SEC regarding their holdings of our stock and any changes to such holdings, and they are subject to short-swing profit liability.  Dividends and Stock Repurchases  The principal source of United’s liquidity is dividends from United Bank. The prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required if the total of all dividends declared by a state-chartered member bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the bank’s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock. Federal law also prohibits a state-chartered, member bank from paying dividends that would be greater than the bank’s undivided profits. United Bank is also subject to limitations under Virginia state law regarding the level of dividends that may be paid.  In addition, United and United Bank are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or    11       Table of Contents      unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The appropriate federal regulatory authorities have stated that paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In addition, in the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.   In July 2019, the federal bank regulators adopted final rules (the “Capital Simplifications Rules”) that, among other things, eliminated the standalone prior approval requirement in the Basel III Capital Rules for any repurchase of common stock. In certain circumstances, United’s repurchases of its common stock may be subject to a prior approval or notice requirement under other regulations, policies or supervisory expectations of the Federal Reserve Board. Any redemption or repurchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt remains subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010  On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), into law. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changes regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes, among other things, provisions creating a Financial Services Oversight Council to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation; centralizing the responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws; permanently raising the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000; establishing strengthened capital standards for banks, and disallowing trust preferred securities as qualifying for Tier 1 capital (subject to certain grandfather provisions for existing trust preferred securities); establishing new minimum mortgage underwriting standards; granting the Federal Reserve Board the power to regulate debit card interchange fees; and implementing corporate governance changes.  On December 10, 2013, the banking agencies issued a final rule implementing Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule”. The Federal Reserve issued an order on December 18, 2014 extending the period which banking entities have to divest disallowed securities under the Volcker Rule to July 21, 2016. The Federal Reserve also announced its intention to grant an additional one year extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2017. On January 14, 2014, the banking agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities (“Trup Cdos”) from the prohibitions under the Volcker Rule. During the third quarter of 2014 United sold four Trup Cdos for a net gain of $1.3 million in response to the Volcker Rule. Under the Volcker Rule, these four securities were identified by United as covered funds and were required to be divested of before July 21, 2017. United has sold its remaining Trup Cdos.  On May 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law the “Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the EGRRCPA Act)” which provides certain limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as certain targeted modifications to other post-financial crisis regulatory requirements. In addition, the legislation establishes new consumer protections and amends various securities- and investment company-related requirements. The EGRRCPA Act primarily amends several other laws, including the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), Federal Credit Union Act, Federal Deposit Insurance Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Securities Act of 1933. The Act is divided into six titles, which aim to: improve consumer access to mortgage credit (Title I); provide regulatory relief and protect consumer access to credit (Title II); protect the credit information of consumers, including veterans and servicemembers (Title III); tailor regulations for certain bank holding companies, including raising the threshold levels for exemption from certain prudential standards and stress testing (Title IV); encourage capital formation by reforming certain Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations (Title V); and protect student borrowers (Title VI).      12       Table of Contents    Deposit Insurance  The deposits of United Bank are insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law. Accordingly, United Bank is also subject to regulation by the FDIC. United Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank’s capital level and supervisory rating (CAMELS rating) and certain financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The risk matrix utilizes four risk categories which are distinguished by capital levels and supervisory ratings.  In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the new restoration plan, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections at least semi-annually for the fund and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking if required.  In April 2011, the FDIC implemented rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act to reform the deposit insurance assessment system. The final rule redefined the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments. Specifically, the rule bases assessments on an institution’s total assets less tangible capital, as opposed to total deposits. Since the new base is larger than the prior base, the FDIC also proposed lowering assessment rates so that the rules would not significantly alter the total amount of revenue collected from the industry. The new assessment scale ranges from 2.5 basis points for the least risky institutions to 45 basis points for the riskiest.  As part of its changes in April 2011, the FDIC established a new methodology for determining assessment rates for large and highly complex institutions, as defined in the rules. In October 2012, the FDIC announced revised changes to some of the definitions used to determine assessment rates for these large and highly complex insured depository institutions. The rule generally applies to FDIC-regulated banks with assets greater than $10 billion and took effect April 1, 2013. In the second quarter of 2018, United Bank was reclassified as a large institution for deposit insurance assessment purposes. Generally, this new classification resulted in higher FDIC insurance premiums.  On September 30, 2018, the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reached 1.36%, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35% ahead of the September 30, 2020, deadline required under the Dodd-Frank Act. FDIC regulations provide for two changes to deposit insurance assessments upon reaching the minimum: (1) surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more (large banks) ceased on December 28, 2018; and (2) small banks will receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between 1.15% and 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38%. United benefited from both these changes.  United’s FDIC insurance expense totaled $10.1 million, $8.1 million, and $11.5 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Capital Requirements  United and United Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve Board (the “Basel III Capital Rules”). Since fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules require United and United Bank to maintain the following:   \n\n\n \n•\n \n A minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of 7.0%);       \n\n\n \n•\n \n A minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%);       \n\n\n \n•\n \n A minimum ratio of total capital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%); and       \n\n\n \n•\n \n A minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”).        13       Table of Contents  ",

In an effort to foster transparency and provide support during this unprecedented time, Verizon launched a daily live webcast with current information on the Company’s actions to address the impacts of COVID-19 as well as a number of broad ranging resources for employees. In addition, Verizon re-trained over 20,000 frontline employees to temporarily serve in other roles, such as customer service or telesales, which not only promoted the health and safety of our employees, but also provided opportunities for learning and career development.

        "For a discussion of the oversight provided by the Verizon Board of Directors over the Company’s human capital management practices, see the section entitled \"Governance — Our Approach to Governance — Our Approach to Strategy and Risk Oversight — Oversight of Human Capital Management\" in our definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered to shareholders in connection with our 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders."

In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks, performing servicing activities for subsidiaries and engaging in activities that the FRB has determined, by order or regulation, are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto under the BHC Act. The Corporation is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our common stock is listed on the Capital Market tier of the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “FLIC” and is subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies. ",
        "As a national bank, the Bank is subject to regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). Insured banks, such as the Bank, are subject to extensive regulation of many aspects of their businesses. These regulations relate to, among other things: (1) the nature and amount of loans that may be made by the Bank and the rates of interest that may be charged; (2) types and amounts of other investments; (3) branching; (4) anti-money laundering; (5) permissible activities; (6) reserve requirements; and (7) dealings with officers, directors and affiliates. ",
        "The Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes in the regulation of depository institutions and their holding companies. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) as an independent bureau of the FRB. The CFPB has assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations, a function previously assigned to principal federal banking regulators, and has authority to impose new requirements. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and subject to the enforcement authority of, their primary federal regulator, although the CFPB has limited back-up authority to examine such institutions.",
        "Bank Holding Company Regulation.",
        " The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for the acquisition by a bank holding company of 5% or more of the voting stock or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Also, under the BHC Act, bank holding companies are prohibited, with certain exceptions, from engaging in, or from acquiring 5% or more of the voting stock of any company engaging in activities other than (1) banking or managing or controlling banks, (2) furnishing services to or performing services for their subsidiaries or (3) activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies that meet certain criteria specified by the FRB may elect to be regulated as a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities including insurance and investment banking.",
        "Payment of Dividends.",
        " The key source of the Corporation’s liquidity is dividends from the Bank. Prior approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the bank’s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. Under the foregoing dividend restrictions, and while maintaining its “well capitalized” status and absent affirmative governmental approvals, during 2021 the Bank could declare dividends to the Corporation of approximately $6.3 million plus any 2021 net profits retained to the date of the dividend declaration.",
        "In addition, the Corporation and the Bank are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimum capital levels. The FRB is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. FRB guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with FRB staff in advance of declaring a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the FRB and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if (1) net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (3) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.",
        "Stock Repurchases.",
        " Current FRB regulations provide that a bank holding company that is not well capitalized or well managed, as such terms are defined in the regulations, or that is subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, is required to give the FRB prior written notice of any repurchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for repurchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such repurchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, will be equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth.

        "However, the FRB staff is interpreting the capital regulations as requiring a bank holding company to secure FRB approval prior to redeeming or repurchasing any capital stock that is included in regulatory capital.",
        "Transactions with Affiliates.",
        " Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies. Regulations promulgated by the FRB limit the types and amounts of these transactions (including loans due and extensions of credit from their U.S. bank subsidiaries) that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on an arm’s-length basis. In general, these regulations require that any “covered transactions” between a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company be limited to 10% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus and, with respect to such parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus. Further, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. ",
        "Source of Strength Doctrine.",
        " FRB policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Corporation is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Corporation may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. ",
        "Capital Requirements.",
        " As a bank holding company, the Corporation is subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements administered by the FRB. The Bank is subject to similar capital requirements administered by the OCC. ",
        "The Corporation and the Bank are subject to the Basel III regulatory capital standards (“Basel III”) issued by the FRB and the OCC. Under the Basel III capital requirements, the Corporation and the Bank are required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 capital to average assets of 4.00%, Common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets of 4.50%, Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets of 6.00% and Total capital to risk weighted assets of 8.00%. Common equity tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, risk weighted assets and average assets are defined in the Basel III rules. Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial statements of the Corporation and Bank. The Corporation and the Bank opted to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income components from Tier 1 and Total regulatory capital.",
        "Basel III also requires the Corporation and the Bank to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.50% in order to avoid being subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital ratio requirements, including the capital conservation buffer, for banks with $250 billion or less in total assets are 7.00% for Common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets, 8.50% for Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets and 10.50% for Total capital to risk weighted assets.",
        "In accordance with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule whereby financial institutions and financial institution holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio of greater than 9% (“qualifying community banking organizations”), are eligible to opt into a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) framework. Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9% are considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the agencies’ capital rules and will be considered to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements under the prompt corrective action (“PCA”) statutes. The agencies reserved the authority to disallow the use of the CBLR framework by a financial institution or holding company, based on the risk profile of the organization. On January 1, 2020, the CBLR framework became effective, and management elected to adopt the alternative framework. As a qualifying community banking organization, the Corporation and the Bank may opt out of the CBLR framework in any subsequent quarter by completing its regulatory agency reporting using the traditional capital rules.",

        "The Corporation’s capital management policy is designed to build and maintain capital levels that exceed regulatory standards and appropriately provide for growth. The leverage ratio of the Corporation and the Bank at December 31, 2020 were 9.97% and 9.98%, respectively.

        " The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (“FDIA”), requires among other things, that the federal banking agencies take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA sets forth the following five capital tiers for purposes of implementing the PCA regulations: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” ",
        "Deposit Insurance. ",
        "The FDIC imposes an assessment on financial institutions for deposit insurance. The assessment is based on the FDIC’s statistical model for estimating the institution’s probability of failure over a three-year period and the institution’s average total assets and average tangible equity. The FDIC periodically adjusts the deposit insurance assessment rates, which may raise or lower the cost to an institution of maintaining FDIC insurance coverage.",
        "The FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution’s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance.",
        "On September 30, 2018, the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio exceeded 1.35%. As a result, during 2019 the Bank was notified of $961,000 in assessment credits from the FDIC for the portion of its assessment that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio. $571,000 of the credit was applied to 2019 assessments and $390,000 was applied to 2020 assessments.",
        "Safety and Soundness Standards.",
        " The FDIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards, through regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying one or more of the safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the PCA provisions of the FDIA. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties. ",
        "Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.",
        " The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low and moderate income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings. Banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering approval of proposed acquisition transactions. The Bank received a “Satisfactory” CRA rating on its most recent Federal examination. The Bank and the Corporation are firmly committed to the practice of fair lending and maintaining strict adherence to all federal and state fair lending laws which prohibit discriminatory lending practices. In May 2020, the OCC issued a final rule to update the agency’s CRA regulations. The final rule clarifies the activities that count for CRA credit, updates where bank activity counts and evaluates CRA performance more objectively.",

        "Anti-Money Laundering and the USA PATRIOT Act.",
        " A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (“Patriot Act”) substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the Patriot Act to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for the institution. The Bank and the Corporation are firmly committed to maintaining strong policies, procedures and controls to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations and to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to change substantially the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. The Corporation cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our financial condition or results of operations.

        "Owners of utility-scale wind facilities are eligible to claim an income tax credit (the PTC, or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) upon initially achieving commercial operation. The PTC is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the wind facility during the first ten years of commercial operation. This incentive was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and has been extended several times. Alternatively, an ITC equal to 30% of the cost of a wind facility may be claimed in lieu of the PTC. Owners of solar facilities are eligible to claim a 30% ITC for new solar facilities. Previously, owners of solar facilities could have elected to receive an equivalent cash payment from the U.S. Department of Treasury for the value of the 30% ITC (convertible ITC) for qualifying solar facilities where construction began before the end of 2011 and the facilities were placed in service before 2017. In order to qualify for the PTC (or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) for wind or ITC for solar, construction of a facility must begin before a specified date and the taxpayer must maintain a continuous program of construction or continuous efforts to advance the project to completion. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued guidance stating that the safe harbor for continuous efforts and continuous construction requirements will generally be satisfied if the facility is placed in service no more than four years after the year in which construction of the facility began (extended to five years for a facility that began construction in 2016 or 2017). The IRS also confirmed that retrofitted wind facilities may re-qualify for PTCs or ITCs pursuant to the 5% safe harbor for the begin construction requirement, as long as the cost basis of the new investment is at least 80% of the facility’s total fair value. Tax credits for qualifying wind and solar projects are subject to the following schedule. ",

        "Electricity markets in the U.S. and Canada are regional and diverse in character. All are extensively regulated, and competition in these markets is shaped and constrained by regulation. The nature of the products offered varies based on the specifics of regulation in each region. Generally, in addition to the natural constraints on pricing freedom presented by competition, NEER may also face specific constraints in the form of price caps, or maximum allowed prices, for certain products. NEER's ability to sell the output of its generation facilities may also be constrained by available transmission capacity, which can vary from time to time and can have a significant impact on pricing.",
        "The degree and nature of competition is different in wholesale markets than in retail markets. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 85% of NEER's revenue was derived from wholesale electricity markets.",

        "its ability to offer and manage reliable customized risk solutions to wholesale customers are competitive advantages. Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is highly fragmented relative to many other commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies NEER competes with depending on the market. In wholesale markets, customers' needs are met through a variety of means, including long-term bilateral contracts, standardized bilateral products such as full requirements service and customized supply and risk management services.",
        "In general, U.S. and Canadian electricity markets encompass three classes of services: energy, capacity and ancillary services. Energy services relate to the physical delivery of power; capacity services relate to the availability of MW capacity of a power generation asset; and ancillary services are other services that relate to power generation assets, such as load regulation and spinning and non-spinning reserves. The exact nature of these classes of services is defined in part by regional tariffs. Not all regions have a capacity services class, and the specific definitions of ancillary services vary from region to region.",
        "RTOs and ISOs exist throughout much of North America to coordinate generation and transmission across wide geographic areas and to run markets. NEER operates in all RTO and ISO jurisdictions. At December 31, 2020, NEER also had generation facilities with ownership interests in a total net generating capacity of approximately 5,913 MW that fall within reliability regions that are not under the jurisdiction of an established RTO or ISO, including 3,641 MW within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council and 1,303 MW within the SERC Reliability Corporation. Although each RTO and ISO may have differing objectives and structures, some benefits of these entities include regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing larger wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability and facilitating competition among wholesale electricity providers. NEER has operations that fall within the following RTOs and ISOs:",
        "NEER competes in different regions to differing degrees, but in general it seeks to enter into long-term bilateral contracts for the full output of its generation facilities. At December 31, 2020, approximately 92% of NEER's net generating capacity was committed under long-term contracts. Where long-term contracts are not in effect, NEER sells the output of its facilities into daily spot markets. In such cases, NEER will frequently enter into shorter term bilateral contracts, typically of less than three years duration, to hedge the price risk associated with selling into a daily spot market. Such bilateral contracts, which may be hedges ",

Contracts that serve the economic purpose of hedging some portion of the expected revenue of a generation facility but are not recorded as hedges under GAAP are referred to as “non-qualifying hedges” for adjusted earnings purposes. See Management's Discussion - Overview - Adjusted Earnings.",
        "Certain facilities within the NEER wind and solar generation portfolio produce RECs and other environmental attributes which are typically sold along with the energy from the plants under long-term contracts, or may be sold separately from wind and solar generation not sold under long-term contracts. The purchasing party is solely entitled to the reporting rights and ownership of the environmental attributes.",
        "While the majority of NEER's revenue is derived from the output of its generation facilities, NEER is also an active competitor in several regions in the wholesale full requirements business and in providing structured and customized power and fuel products and services to a variety of customers. In the full requirements service, typically, the supplier agrees to meet the customer's needs for a full range of products for every hour of the day, at a fixed price, for a predetermined period of time, thereby assuming the risk of fluctuations in the customer's volume requirements.",
        "Expanded competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for NEER. Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient facilities that can sell power in competitive markets. NEER seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its facilities.",

If a financial holding company ceases to meet the capital and management requirements, the FRB’s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, the FRB may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the FRB. In addition, the failure to meet such requirements could result in other material restrictions on the activities of the financial holding company, may also adversely affect the financial holding company’s ability to enter into certain transactions, including acquisition transactions, or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith, and may result in the bank holding company losing financial holding company status. Any restrictions imposed on our activities by the FRB may not necessarily be made known to the public. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, which period may be extended, the FRB may require the financial holding company to divest its subsidiary depository institutions or to discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company. If any insured depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company fails to maintain a CRA rating of at least “Satisfactory,” the financial holding company would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions. Bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state.",

The risk-based requirements are based on a banking organization’s risk-weighted assets, also known as RWA, which reflect the organization’s on- and off-balance sheet exposures, subject to risk weights. The leverage requirements are based on a banking organization’s average consolidated on-balance sheet assets. For more detail on our regulatory capital, see the “Capital and Regulatory Matters” section of Item 7.",

In reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, on September 30, 2020 the FRB and the other federal banking regulators adopted a final rule relative to regulatory capital treatment of ACL under CECL. This rule allowed electing banking organizations to delay the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for a two-year period ending January 1, 2022, followed by a three-year transition period ending January 1, 2025 to phase-in the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay.

        "Effective October 1, 2020, the FRB finalized our stress capital buffer (“SCB”) of 3.4% which replaced the capital conservation buffer (“CCB”) of 2.5%. Our SCB of 3.4% is based on the results of the 2020 Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (“DFAST”) in connection with the related CCAR and is imposed on top of each of the three minimum risk-weighted asset ratios listed above. For Category IV firms, like us, the FRB has stated that the SCB will be re-calibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends and common share buybacks. Banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios with the SCB taken into account will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income”, defined as the greater of four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income, or the average four quarter trailing net income. On September 30, 2020, the FRB issued a proposed rule to make conforming changes to its Capital Plan Rule, stress capital buffer requirements, and capital planning requirements to be consistent with the Tailoring Rules framework. Under the proposal, Category IV firms, like us, would have the ability to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test and receive an updated SCB requirement in a year in which they are not subject to the supervisory stress test.

        "The FDIA requires the FRB, OCC and FDIC to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions, including CBNA. The agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines that set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard, it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans. If, after being notified to submit a compliance plan, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the FDIA. See “Federal Deposit Insurance Act” below. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.",
        "Federal Deposit Insurance Act",
        "The FDIA requires, among other things, that the federal banking regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements, as described above in “Capital.” The FDIA sets forth the following five capital categories: “well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital category depends upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation. The federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, with the actions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institution’s capital category. Under existing rules, an institution that is not an advanced approaches institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%, a total capital ratio of at least 10%, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%.",
        "The FDIA’s prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies. The FRB’s regulations applicable to bank holding companies separately define “well capitalized” for bank holding companies to require maintaining a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6% and a total capital ratio of at least 10%. As described above under “—Financial Holding Company Regulation”, a financial holding company that is not well-capitalized and well-managed (or whose bank subsidiaries are not well ",

        "capitalized and well managed) under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose financial holding company status. As of December 31, 2020, the Parent Company and CBNA were well-capitalized. ",
        "The FDIA prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally, depending upon where the deposits are solicited, unless it is “well-capitalized,” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is “adequately capitalized” and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. The FDIA imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is “well-capitalized.”",
        "Deposit Insurance",
        "The FDIA requires CBNA to pay deposit insurance assessments. FDIC assessment rates for large institutions are calculated based on one of two scorecards. One for most large institutions that have more than $10 billion in assets and another for “highly complex” institutions that have over $50 billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over $500 billion in assets. Each scorecard has a performance score and a loss-severity score that are combined to produce a total score, which is translated into an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC utilizes the CAMELS ratings and forward-looking financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score, based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard. The total score is then translated to an initial base assessment rate on a non-linear, sharply-increasing scale.",
        "The deposit insurance assessment is calculated based on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period. Deposit insurance assessments are also affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). The FDIA established a minimum reserve ratio of the DIF of 1.15% prior to September 2020 and 1.35% thereafter. As of September 30, 2020, the reserve ratio of the DIF was 1.30%. On September 15, 2020, the FDIC’s Board of Directors voted to adopt a restoration plan to restore the DIF reserve ratio to at least 1.35% within 8 years, as required by the FDIA.",
        "Dividends",
        "Various federal statutory provisions and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay.",
        "Our payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to the oversight of the FRB. In particular, the FRB reviews the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large bank holding company based on capital plans submitted as part of the CCAR process and on the results of stress tests, as discussed above. In addition to other limitations, our ability to make any capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, is contingent on the FRB’s non-objection to such planned distributions included in our submitted capital plan or the FRB’s authorization to make distributions if we are exempt from the requirement to submit a capital plan. See “—Capital” and “—Capital Planning and Stress Testing Requirements” above.",
        "Dividends payable by CBNA, as a national bank subsidiary, are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus, unless the national bank obtains the approval of the OCC. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s “undivided profits” (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus). Federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements that provide that FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings.

        "Under Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which codifies the FRB’s long-standing “source of strength” doctrine, the Parent Company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for our depository institution subsidiary. The statute defines “source of financial strength” as the ability to provide financial assistance in the event of the financial distress at the insured depository institution. The FRB may require that the Parent Company provide such support at times even when the Parent Company may not have the financial resources to do so, or when doing so may not serve our interests or those of our shareholders or creditors. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.",
        "Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders",
        "Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and related FRB rules, including Regulation W, restrict CBNA from extending credit to, or engaging in certain other transactions with, the Parent Company and its non-bank subsidiaries. These restrictions place limits on certain specified “covered transactions” between bank subsidiaries and their affiliates, which must be limited to 10% of a bank’s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20% for all affiliates. Furthermore, within the foregoing limitations as to amount, certain covered transactions must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from 100% to 130%. Covered transactions are defined to include, among other things, a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the FRB) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, derivatives transactions and securities lending transactions where the bank has credit exposure to an affiliate, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. All covered transactions, including certain additional transactions (such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest), must be conducted on market terms. The FRB enforces these restrictions and we are audited for compliance.",
        "Section 23B prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. Transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits. The FRB also may designate banking subsidiaries as affiliates.",
        "Pursuant to FRB Regulation O, we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their related interests. In general, such extensions of credit may not exceed certain dollar limitations, must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our Board.",

        "The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in, sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as certain hedge funds or private equity funds. The statutory provision is commonly called the “Volcker Rule.” In October 2019, the FRB, OCC, FDIC, the SEC and the CFTC (collectively, the “Volcker Agencies”) finalized amendments to their regulations to tailor the Volcker Rule’s compliance requirements to the amount of a firm’s trading activity, revise the definition of trading account, clarify certain key provisions in the Volcker Rule, and modify the information companies are required to provide the Volcker Agencies. Under those amendments, we expect that we would be regarded as having “moderate” trading assets and liabilities, and therefore subject to a requirement to have a simplified compliance program that is appropriate for our activities, size, scope, and complexity. In June 2020, the Volcker Agencies finalized other regulations modifying the Volcker Rule’s prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds (referred to under the rule as covered funds). This final rule became effective October 1, 2020. We do not expect either of these regulatory amendments to the Volcker Rule to have a material impact on Citizens.",

Both the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, issued by the FRB, govern the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies.",
        "The federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions. Financial institutions are expected to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers’ accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. Further, a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.

Recently, several states have adopted laws and regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020, gives new rights to California residents to require certain businesses to disclose or delete their personal information. In addition, many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements.

The CRA requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency, in connection with its examination of a depository institution, to assess such institution’s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution and assign ratings. The regulatory agency’s evaluation of the institution’s record and ratings are made public. These CRA performance evaluations are also considered by regulatory agencies in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility, and, in the case of a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status, a CRA rating of at least “satisfactory” is required to commence certain new financial activities or to acquire a company engaged in such activities.

The guidelines set forth minimum standards for the design and implementation of a bank’s risk governance framework, and minimum standards for oversight of that framework by a bank’s board of directors. The guidelines are intended to protect the safety and soundness of covered banks and improve bank examiners’ ability to assess compliance with the OCC’s expectations. Under the guidelines, a bank may use its parent company’s risk governance framework if the framework meets the minimum standards, the risk profiles of the parent company and the covered bank are substantially the same, and certain other conditions are met. CBNA has elected to use the Parent Company’s risk governance framework. A bank’s board of directors is required to have two members who are independent of the bank and parent company management. A bank’s board of directors is responsible for ensuring that the risk governance framework meets the standards in the guidelines, providing active oversight and a credible challenge to management’s recommendations and decisions and ensuring that the parent company decisions do not jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank.",

        "Substantially all the deposits of BPPR and PB are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC, and BPPR and PB are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. Deposit insurance assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution minus the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period. For smaller depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, the FDIC assigns an individual rate based on a formula using financial data and CAMELS ratings. A depository institution reporting over $10 billion in assets for four consecutive quarters will be reclassified as a large depository institution. PB has consecutively reported assets of more than $10 billion since the third quarter of 2019 and has now been categorized as a larger depository institution. For larger depository institutions with over $10 billion in assets, such as BPPR, and PB, the FDIC uses a “scorecard” methodology, which also considers CAMELS ratings, among other measures, that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual large institution will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the DIF if such a failure occurs. The FDIC has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations. The initial base deposit insurance assessment rate for larger depository institutions ranges from 3 to 30 basis points on an annualized basis. After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range from 1.5 to 40 basis points on an annualized basis. ",

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, including Popular, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the Basel III Capital Rules’ specific requirements.",

The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and eligible retained income (that is, four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income). Thus, Popular, BPPR and PB are required to maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.

Pursuant to the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including Popular, BPPR and PB, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items.

A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors.",

An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. An insured depository institution’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the institution’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.",

Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution’s holding company must guarantee the capital restoration plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution’s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency, when the institution fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital.

Various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval. A member bank must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year, combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board. Pursuant to these requirements, PB may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. During the year ended December 31, 2020, BPPR declared cash dividends of $578 million, a portion of which was used by Popular for the payments of the cash dividends on its outstanding common stock and a $500 million in accelerated stock repurchases. Subject to the Federal Reserve’s ability to establish more stringent specific requirements under its supervisory or enforcement authority, at December 31, 2020, BPPR could have declared a dividend of approximately $86.9 million.

        "It is Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Moreover, under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company should not maintain dividend levels that place undue pressure on the capital of depository institution subsidiaries or that may undermine the bank holding company’s ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Federal Reserve policy also provides that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company's capital structure.

If a bank is authorized to establish one or more bank branches in a state of the United States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that state or country, the Office of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from the reserve requirements of Section 16.

Institutions rated 2 in their last regulatory examination may include this additional component in their legal lending limit only with the previous authorization of the Office of the Commissioner.

In addition, we assure that each business unit of the Company has talent management strategies and development plans to meet its future leadership needs. Effective succession planning helps us identify employees with leadership potential and also allows us to evaluate any gaps in education, skills and experience that need to be addressed to prepare those employees to move into leadership roles. At management review meetings, officers and directors review how business units are addressing succession planning, leadership opportunities and retirement projections. ",

Based on survey results, business units and individual managers are encouraged to take meaningful actions to improve the employee experience. In response to past surveys, we have launched enterprise-wide initiatives focused on improving communication between employees and management as well as removing obstacles that prevent job success. Other initiatives driven by the survey have given employees more access to leadership and improved meeting efficiency. Our cross-functional Employee Engagement Council focuses on improving employee recognition across the organization.  We work to ensure that a positive work environment is maintained for all employees. Through an outreach initiative, we obtain feedback from new hires regarding their employee experience. In 2019, we integrated our employee experience surveys with onboarding surveys and exit interviews.

        "e.g",
        "., respiratory, occupational, physical and infusion therapies), qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment, reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies. In addition, as described below, operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the federal Stark Law (“Stark Law”), and the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), as well as comparable state laws. Hospitals, physician group practice clinics, and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state, and local licensure, registration, certification, and inspection laws, regulations, and industry standards, as well as other conditions of participation in federal and state government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Further, operators of long-term care facilities are required to have in place compliance and ethics programs that meet the requirements of federal laws and regulations. Our tenants’ failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in, among other things: loss of accreditation; denial of reimbursement; imposition of fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal and state health care programs; loss of license; or closure of the facility. See risk factors “The requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid, could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us” and “Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us” in “Item 1A – Risk Factors” below. Moreover, in light of certain arrangements that Welltower may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, and given that certain of our arrangements are structured under the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (\"RIDEA\"), certain health care fraud and abuse laws and data privacy laws could apply directly to Welltower. See risk factor \"We assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in RIDEA structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations, and financial condition\" in \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" below.",
        "Licensing and Certification",
        "The primary regulations that affect long-term and post-acute care facilities are state licensing and registration laws. For example, certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need (“CON”) laws and regulations. Where applicable, CON laws generally require, among other requirements, that a facility demonstrate the need for (1) constructing a new facility, (2) adding beds or expanding an existing facility, (3) investing in major capital equipment or adding new services, (4) changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or (5) terminating services that have been previously approved through the CON process. Certain state CON laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services. In addition, CON laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator.",
        "8",
        "With respect to licensure, generally our long-term/post-acute care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs. The failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property. In addition, if a property is found to be out of compliance with Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state health care program conditions of participation, the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs.",
        "Reimbursement",
        "The reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve. Federal and state authorities have considered and implemented and may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies, including value-based reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations. Likewise, third-party payors may continue imposing greater controls on operators, including through changes in reimbursement rates and fee structures. The impact of any such changes, if implemented, may result in a material adverse effect on our portfolio. No assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently, or will be in the future, sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses.",

        "Seniors Housing Facilities",
        "  The majority of the revenues received by the operators of U.S. seniors housing facilities are from private pay sources. The remaining revenue source is primarily Medicaid provided under state waiver programs for home and community-based care. There can be no guarantee that a state Medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status. Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs. Generally, facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a Medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care. The level of Medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state. Thus, the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix, acuity level, changes in Medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels.",

        "Long-Term/Post-Acute Care Facilities",

Consequently, changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses, including our rent or debt service. Long-term/post-acute care facilities are subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities. A review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments, denials or delay of payments in the future. Due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting, no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements or to cover settlements made to payors.",
        "◦",
        "Medicare Reimbursement",
        " Generally, long-term/post-acute care facilities are reimbursed by Medicare under prospective payment systems, which generally provide reimbursement based upon a predetermined fixed amount per episode of care and are updated by CMS, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) annually. There is a risk under these payment systems that costs will exceed the fixed payments, or that payments may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services. Further, there is risk that Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (\"SNF\") payment reforms may impact our tenants and operators. In addition, the HHS Office of Inspector General has released recommendations to address SNF billing practices and Medicare payment rates. If followed, these recommendations regarding SNF payment reform may impact our tenants and operators.",
        "◦",
        "Medicaid Reimbursement",
        "  Many states reimburse SNFs using fixed daily rates, which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care. In most states, Medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing services. Certain states are attempting to slow the rate of Medicaid growth by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits. In addition, Medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if state revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures.",

        "Medicare Reimbursement for Physicians, Hospital Outpatient Departments (“HOPDs”), and Ambulatory Surgical Centers (“ASCs”)",
        " Changes in reimbursement to physicians, HOPDs and ASCs may further affect our tenants and operators. Generally, Medicare reimburses physicians under the Physician Fee Schedule, while HOPDs and ASCs are reimbursed under prospective payment systems. The Physician Fee Schedule and the HOPD and ASC prospective payment systems are updated annually by CMS. These annual Medicare payment regulations have resulted in lower net pay increases than providers of those services have often expected. In addition, the Medicare and Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) includes payment reductions for providers who do not meet government quality standards. The implementation of pay-for-quality models like those required under MACRA has the potential to produce funding disparities that could adversely impact some provider tenants in outpatient medical buildings and other health care properties. Changes in Medicare Advantage plan payments may also indirectly affect our operators and tenants that contract with Medicare Advantage plans.",

        "the U.S. and contained various provisions, including Medicaid expansion and the establishment of Health Insurance Exchanges (“HIEs”) providing subsidized health insurance, that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our properties. The status of the Health Reform Laws may be subject to change as a result of political, legislative, regulatory and administrative developments and judicial proceedings. While legislative attempts to completely repeal the Health Reform Laws have been unsuccessful to date, there have been multiple attempts to repeal or amend the Health Reform Laws through legislative action and legal challenges. During the Trump Administration, the former president and U.S. Congress sought to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all or portions of the Health Reform Laws. For example, in December 2017, the U.S. Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which included a provision that eliminates the penalty under the Health Reform Laws’ individual mandate, effective in 2019, and could impact the future state of the HIEs established by the Health Reform Laws. In December 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled the individual mandate was unconstitutional and could not be severed from the Health Reform Laws. As a result, the court ruled the remaining provisions of the Health Reform Laws were also invalid, though the court declined to issue a preliminary injunction with respect to the Health Reform Laws. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but remanded the case back to the district court to reassess how much of the Health Reform Laws would be damaged without the individual mandate provision, and if the individual mandate could indeed be severed. The Fifth Circuit's decision was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on these issues and conducted an oral argument in November 2020. This litigation is still ongoing, but places great uncertainty upon the longevity and nature of the Health Reform Laws moving forward. There is also uncertainty with respect to the impact the Biden Administration and the new U.S. Congress may have on health reform including through new legislative, executive order, or regulatory efforts and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for health care items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Health Reform Laws. We cannot predict whether the existing Health Reform Laws, or future health care reform legislation, executive order, or regulatory changes, will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business.",
        "Fraud & Abuse Enforcement",
        "Long-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers. Certain of these laws, such as the AKS and Stark Law, prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs. Other government health program laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service. Our operators and tenants that receive payments from federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, are subject to substantial financial penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the FCA upon a finding of noncompliance with such laws. In addition, states may also have separate false claims acts, which, among other things, generally prohibit health care providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payments. Federal and state FCAs contain \"whistleblower\" provisions that permit private individuals to bring health care fraud enforcement claims on behalf of the government. Still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety, health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided. Sanctions for violations of these laws, regulations and other applicable guidance may include, but are not limited to, criminal and/or civil penalties and fines, loss of licensure, immediate termination of government payments, exclusion from any government health care program, damage assessments and imprisonment. In certain circumstances, violation of these rules (such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior) with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions, including exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as other government health care programs. In the ordinary course of its business, a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries, investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations.",
        "Prosecutions, investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity, financial condition, and operations, which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us. In addition, government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue. The costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us. In addition, Welltower could potentially be directly subject to these health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as potential investigation or enforcement, as a result of our RIDEA-structured arrangements, and certain collaboration or other arrangements we may pursue with stakeholders who are directly subject to these laws.",

Moreover, such costs could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us. Finally, data privacy and security laws and regulations continue to develop, including with regard to HIPAA and U.S. state privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the new California Privacy Rights Act that will go into effect in 2023. As we use data to better inform our investments and the efficacy of care in our communities, these developments may add potential uncertainty towards compliance obligations, business operations or transactions that depend on data. These new privacy laws may create restrictions or requirements in our, our operators' and other business partners' use, sharing and securing of data.

Additional taxable REIT subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we obtain an interest.",
        "Annual Distribution Requirements",
        "  In order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation, we are required to make distributions (other than capital gain distributions) to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to (1) the sum of (i) 90% of our “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the after-tax net income, if any, from foreclosure property, minus (2) a portion of certain items of non-cash income. These distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration. Prior to 2014, with respect to all REITs the amount distributed could not be preferential. This means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class, and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class (the “preferential dividend rule”). Beginning in tax years after 2014, the preferential dividend rule no longer applies to publicly offered REITs, however, the rule is still applicable to other entities taxed as REITs, which would include several of our subsidiaries. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates. As discussed above, we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements. We believe we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our initial REIT election and each year thereafter through the year ended December 31, 2020. Although we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements for subsequent years, economic, market, legal, tax or other factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements. See “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”",
        "It is also possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement, or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, due to, among other things, (1) timing differences between (i) the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and (ii) the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income, or (2) the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us. In the event that timing differences occur, we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or, if possible, pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement.",
        "Under certain circumstances, including in the event of a deficiency determined by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year, which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year. Thus, we may be able to avoid being disqualified as a REIT and/or taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends; however, we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions.",
        "Failure to Qualify as a REIT",
        "If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year. All distributions to stockholders will be taxable as dividends to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and, subject to certain limitations, will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we also will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief. Failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities.",
        "In addition to the relief described above under “Income Tests” and “Asset Tests,” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the Internal Revenue Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT if: (1) the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; (2) we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each failure to satisfy the provision; and (3) the violation does not include a violation described under “Income Tests” or “Asset Tests” above. It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions.",

        "So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT, distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions (and not designated as capital gain dividends) will be taxable as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. None of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for U.S. corporate stockholders.",
        "Generally, the current maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 20%. Except in limited circumstances, this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares, because generally we are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders. The reduced maximum U.S. federal income tax rate will apply to that portion, if any, of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to: (1) dividends received by us from non-REIT corporations or other taxable REIT subsidiaries; (2) income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay U.S. federal corporate income tax during the prior year (if, for example, we did not distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income for the prior year); or (3) the amount of any earnings and profits distributed by us and accumulated in a non-REIT year.",
        "Although the preferential 20% rate on qualified dividends is generally not applicable to dividends to our shareholders, the Internal Revenue Code provides for a deduction from income for individuals, trusts and estates for 20% of taxable REIT dividends not eligible for the preferential rate, excluding capital gain dividends. This deduction is not taken into account for purposes of determining the 3.8% tax on net investment income (described below) and, unlike the preferential rate, expires after 2025.",
        "Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year), without regard to the period for which you held our stock. However, if you are a corporation, you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income.",
        "If we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net capital gain and designate such amount in a timely notice to you, you would include in income, as long-term capital gain, your proportionate share of this net capital gain. You would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains, and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid.",
        "You may not include in your U.S. federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses. U.S. federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you. In addition, any distribution declared by us in October, November or December of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on December 31 of that year, provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than January 31 of the following year.",
        "We will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax discussed under “General” and “Qualification as a REIT - Annual Distribution Requirements” above. As a result, you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a tax-free return of capital. Moreover, any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend (an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend, as the case may be), regardless of our earnings and profits. Any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will generally not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock. You will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero, after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain, if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets. The tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss, if any, realized upon the sale of the shares of our stock. Any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less (after application of certain holding period rules) will generally be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock.",
        "Upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock (whether actually or constructively owned) with us, you will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock. This gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset.",
        "If we redeem any of your shares in us, the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption. In general, you will recognize gain or loss (as opposed to dividend income) equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption: (1) results ",
        "17",
        "in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities; (2) is a “substantially disproportionate redemption”; or (3) is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you. In applying these tests, you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities (e.g., common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants). You also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you.",
        "If, as a result of a redemption by us of your shares, you no longer own (either actually or constructively) any of our equity securities or only own (actually and constructively) an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities, then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and, thus, would result in gain or loss to you. However, whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances, and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption, you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation.",
        "Generally, if the redemption does not meet the tests described above, then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits. If the redemption is taxed as a dividend, your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own. If you own no other shareholdings in us, under certain circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related person, or it may be lost entirely.",
        "Gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum long-term capital gain rate of 20% in the case of stockholders who are individuals and 21% in the case of stockholders that are corporations.  Pursuant to Internal Revenue Service guidance, we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as eligible for specific treatment provided under the Internal Revenue Code, which, depending on the nature of the capital gains, may result in taxation of such portions at rates of either 20% or 25%. Capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long-term capital losses. The deduction for capital losses is subject to limitations.",
        "An additional tax of 3.8% generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of U.S. stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals, estates or certain trusts. Among other items, “net investment income” generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain property, such as shares of our common stock or warrants. In the case of individuals, this tax will only apply to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses, and $125,000 for married individuals filing a separate return). U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this additional tax in their particular circumstances.",
        "Treatment of Tax-Exempt U.S. Stockholders",
        "  Tax-exempt entities, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts (“Exempt Organizations”), generally are exempt from U.S. federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). The Internal Revenue Service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a REIT to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on this ruling, amounts distributed by us to Exempt Organizations generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an Exempt Organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules. Likewise, a portion of the Exempt Organization’s income from us would constitute UBTI if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit. A tax-exempt U.S. stockholder that is subject to tax on its UBTI will be required to segregate its taxable income and loss for each unrelated trade or business activity for purposes of determining its UBTI.",

Backup withholding will apply only if you: (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding.",
        "Backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and tax-exempt organizations. You should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding, and the procedure for obtaining an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund, provided that the required information is provided to the Internal Revenue Service.",

        "In general, you will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States. A corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is, or is treated as, effectively connected with a United States trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax, which is payable in addition to regular United States corporate income tax. The following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected. We expect to withhold United States income tax, as described below, on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless (1) you file an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or (2) certain other exceptions apply.",
        "Distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real property interest will be taxed to you under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. stockholder on these amounts, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals. Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption. We will be required to withhold tax at a rate of 21% from distributions subject to FIRPTA. We will be required to withhold from distributions subject to FIRPTA, and remit to the Internal Revenue Service, 21% of designated capital gain dividends, or, if greater, 21% of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends. In addition, if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends, subsequent distributions, up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against, will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding.",
        "Any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 10% of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year. Foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on U.S. federal income tax returns and all distributions received by such stockholders treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including any such capital gain dividends) will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax (unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty) as discussed above. In addition, the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions.",
        "Unless our shares constitute a “United States real property interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA or are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to United States taxation. Even if our shares were to constitute a “United States real property interest,” non-U.S. stockholders that are “qualified foreign pension funds” (or are owned by a qualified foreign pension fund) meeting certain requirements may be exempt from FIRPTA withholding on the sale or disposition of our shares. Our shares will not constitute a United States real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled REIT.” We believe that we qualify as and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled REIT. A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders. Generally, we are permitted to assume that holders of less than 5% of our shares at all times during a specified testing period are U.S. persons. However, if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply, you will be subject to a 30% tax on such capital gains. In any event, a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under FIRPTA to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled REIT. Otherwise, under FIRPTA, the purchaser may be required to withhold 15% of the purchase price and remit such amount to the Internal Revenue Service.",

Payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the United States or conducted through certain U.S. related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a U.S. person (and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a U.S. person) or otherwise establishes an exemption.

Accordingly, the entity through which shares of our stock are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, the virus continues to spread and many countries are experiencing a resurgence in infection rates. Although vaccines have recently been made available, the availability and distribution of the vaccines continue to provide challenges. ",
        "Governments took unprecedented actions to contain the spread of COVID-19, temporarily shutting down non-essential businesses, issuing stay at home or “shelter in place” orders and asking citizens to avoid all non-essential travel. In certain situations, governments closed borders and issued mandatory quarantines. Companies were asked, and in many cases were required, to allow non-essential employees to work remotely. Consumer spending declined, global travel demand declined significantly, and the world entered a global recession.",
        "These events impacted our business operations in multiple ways. In the first quarter of 2020, we quickly responded to the changing environment. In January 2020, we implemented policies in select countries within Asia to restrict travel and require employees to work from home for all roles that allow for remote work. In March 2020, we expanded this work from home policy to include our employees worldwide. We introduced appropriate safety and hygiene protocols to enable our manufacturing employees to operate safely through the pandemic. We actively monitored the changing government rules and regulations for each of our locations worldwide.",
        "We remain cautious as many factors remain unpredictable, including the increasing rate of COVID-19 infections. We continue to monitor COVID-19 infection rates globally and acknowledge the risk of new surges in COVID-19 infections.",
        "We prepared procedures for the phased return of our employees to office sites and trained our local site leaders in the appropriate safety and hygiene protocols. As of December 31, 2020, all of our manufacturing sites continue to operate and, outside of India, most of our employees in Asia have returned to the workplace in some capacity. We also returned small numbers of workers to select office sites within Europe and North America. In many countries, including the U.S., most of our non-manufacturing employees continue to work from home (for all roles that allow for remote work).",

We also compete by offering a unique professional opportunity to work in a high-integrity environment where the focus is on building stockholder value over the very long term.

        "Rockland Trust encourages colleagues to continually seek ways to learn and grow.  The Company's Performance Management and Feedback System allows managers to formally recognize colleagues’ achievements and identify goals and areas for improvement.  In addition to this annual feedback, colleagues are recognized in many other ways periodically.  Colleagues are encouraged to recognize each other's excellent internal and external customer service through a peer recognition, “You Make a Difference” awards.  Managers are also provided the opportunity to recognize colleagues privately, through “Kudos”, which have proven to be especially helpful for remote teams.  In order to celebrate the academic achievements of colleagues, an annual recognition luncheon is hosted by the Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Oddleifson, when they receive a degree or certification.  Colleagues are also recognized for extraordinary efforts through annual “Shining Star” awards and other awards at the annual All Employee Meeting. ",

Throughout the pandemic, management has conducted regular surveys of our workforce to better understand our colleagues’ experiences and needs.  To support colleagues who are parents, guardians and caregivers, the Company has offered flexible time off options, childcare and tutoring assistance and offered many colleagues work from home flexibility.  In just a few weeks, the technology team implemented remote work capabilities for hundreds of colleagues.  To assist them with this transition, the Company offered its remote colleagues resources to work productively from home and provided managers with guidance on managing remote teams.  Additionally, beginning in March of 2020, Rockland Trust and its affiliated foundations approved the distribution of $500,000 over and above its annual giving in response to arising needs brought on by the pandemic.  The first phase of giving supported nine front-line organizations across Rockland Trust’s service area, including local United Way chapters and Community Foundations, to address the immediate, basic needs of our communities.  The second phase of giving focused on meeting the needs of specific at-risk populations including survivors of domestic violence, homeless and housing insecure individuals and immigrant and vulnerable populations.

Rockland Trust has an inclusive workforce that enables the Company to better perform for its customers and the diverse communities in which it operates. There has been an established diversity and inclusion program for over sixteen years, which continues to grow and evolve. ",
        "The Diversity and Inclusion Council was formed in 2004.  Rockland Trust works to ensure colleagues have an opportunity to be heard, valued and engaged.  Rockland Trust offers three Employee Resource Groups (ERGs): Inclusion Network, Women of Action, and Pride Alliance. These voluntary, employee-led groups join together to provide opportunities for colleagues to get involved in making our workforce and communities more inclusive and equitable. ",
        "In addition to the efforts described above, there are many other ways the Company promotes diversity and inclusion among its workforce.  The Diversity and Inclusion Council, which is comprised of Executive and Senior Leaders from all business units, develops strategic priorities and works with the ERGs and business units to execute these priorities.  Rockland Trust also partners with diverse organizations to support diverse recruitment efforts and provide professional development opportunities for professionals of color.  For example, each year Rockland Trust invites colleagues to participate in The Partnership, a third party organization that offers leadership development programs for racially and ethnically diverse professionals throughout the New England area.  Management has also pledged to increase participation in The Partnership in 2021.  ",

Our drivers and mechanics have been on the front lines to ensure the delivery of essential products, and we take this responsibility seriously. Our primary focus will always be protecting the health and personal safety of our associates, their families and communities, and our customers. Our leadership team meets frequently to address issues related to customers, freight, drivers, safety, staffing, human resources, and costs and provides regular updates to all our associates. Throughout our offices and terminal network, we are closely following the safety guidelines set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and World Health Organization (“WHO”), including hygiene and social distancing. We made and intend to continue making significant investments in personal protective products to keep our associates safe, and over half of our office associates continue working from home.

In 2020, we were recognized among the Top Companies for Women to Work for in Transportation by the Women in Trucking Association for the third consecutive year. Werner was recognized for our support of gender diversity, flexible hours and work requirements, competitive compensation and benefits, and professional development opportunities and career advancement opportunities. At Werner, our female driver workforce is approximately double the national average, and more than half of our driver associates are ethically diverse. Additionally, over half of our non-driver associates are female or ethnically diverse. Werner was also named a top 30 Best for Vets Employer in 2020 by Military Times for the sixth consecutive year, placing above all other trucking companies. We are widely recognized as a transportation leader in military hiring, with veterans and veteran spouses comprising approximately 20 percent of our workforce.",
        "Professional Driver Recruitment:",

For most company-employed drivers, the rate per mile generally increases with the drivers’ length of service. Professional drivers may earn additional compensation through incentive performance pay programs and for performing additional work associated with their job (such as loading and unloading freight and making extra stops and shorter mileage trips).",
        "At times, there are driver shortages in the trucking industry. Availability of experienced drivers can be affected by (i) changes in the demographic composition of the workforce; (ii) alternative employment opportunities other than truck driving that become available in the economy; and (iii) individual drivers’ desire to be home more frequently. We believe that a declining number of, and increased competition for, driver training school graduates, aging truck driver demographics and increased truck safety regulations are tightening driver supply.",
        "At Werner, we continue to take actions to strengthen our driver recruiting and retention to make Werner a preferred choice for the best drivers. Our efforts include raising driver pay, maintaining a new truck and trailer fleet, purchasing best-in-class safety features for all new trucks, investing in our driver training school network and collaborating with customers to improve or eliminate unproductive freight. We are focused on providing strong mileage utilization and a large percentage of driving jobs in shorter-haul operations (such as Dedicated and Regional) that allow drivers to return home more often. We continue to improve our terminal network to enhance the driver experience. Our new untethered, tablet-based telematics solution implemented in 2020 provides Werner drivers with a more efficient experience through smart workflow, best-in-class navigation, improved safety features and reduced manual data entry. While the trucking industry suffers from high driver turnover rates, we are proud that our efforts in recent years have continued to have positive results on our driver retention.",

They continue to gain industry experience through our career track program by partnering with a Werner-certified leader prior to that driver becoming a solo driver with their own truck. As mentioned above, the recruiting environment for recent driver training school graduates became even more challenging in 2020 as social distancing requirements, state licensing cut backs and temporary closures limited the number of placement drivers entering our career track program. The availability of these drivers has also been negatively impacted by the decreased availability of student loan financing for driver training schools. At the end of 2020, we owned two driver training schools that operate a total of 14 driver training locations to assist with the training and development of drivers for our company and the industry, and we plan to open four new driver training locations during 2021.",

Independent contractors also provide us with another source of drivers to support our fleet. We intend to maintain our emphasis on independent contractor recruiting, in addition to company driver recruitment. We, along with others in the trucking industry, however, continue to experience independent contractor recruitment and retention difficulties that have persisted over the past several years. Challenging operating conditions, including inflationary cost increases that are the responsibility of independent contractors and a shortage of financing available to independent contractors for equipment purchases, continue to make it difficult to recruit and retain independent contractors.",

In addition, the available pool of independent contractor drivers is smaller than it has been historically. Accordingly, we may face difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers for all of our current tractors and for those we may add. Additionally, we may face difficulty in increasing the number of our independent contractor drivers. In addition, our industry suffers from high turnover rates of drivers. Our turnover rate requires us to recruit a substantial number of drivers. Moreover, our turnover rate could increase.

The companies develop skill sets in co-workers through a variety of means, including union apprenticeship programs and yearly trainings for newly required skills. In 2021, the companies will launch a full-scale development program for leaders to enable robust succession planning and improve employee engagement and empowerment.",

In September 2020, the U.S. EPA issued a final rule that removed the transmission and storage segment from the 2016 new source performance standards, rescinded VOC and methane emissions standards for the transmission and storage segment and rescinded methane emissions standards for the production and processing segments.  Various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging the U.S. EPA's 2016 standards and its September 2020 final rule. Notwithstanding the current court challenges, the U.S. EPA under the Biden Administration may reconsider the September 2020 final rule, which could result in more stringent methane emission rulemaking.

        "Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing and Other Operations - United States.",
        "  Substantially all of the onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by EOG are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing.  Hydraulic fracturing technology, which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced, enables EOG to produce crude oil and natural gas that otherwise would not be recovered.",
        "Specifically, hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface.",
        "Hydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground, a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers, and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers.",
        "The makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process typically includes water and sand, and less than 1% of highly diluted chemical additives; lists of the chemical additives used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of the components of fracturing fluids.",
        "While the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures, a significant amount of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either reused or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities.  EOG periodically conducts regulatory assessments of these disposal facilities to monitor compliance with applicable regulations.  ",
        "The regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements.  In April 2012, however, the U.S. EPA issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that require operators to significantly reduce VOC emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of \"green completions\" to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air.  The U.S. EPA has also issued regulations that establish standards for VOC emissions from several types of equipment, including storage tanks, compressors, dehydrators, and valves and sweetening units at gas processing plants.  In addition, in May 2016, the U.S. EPA issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane and VOC emissions from new, modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations, gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations. In September 2020, the U.S. EPA issued amendments to the 2012 and 2016 new source performance standards, which removed the transmission and storage segment from the new source performance standards, rescinded VOC and methane emissions standards for the transmission and storage segment, and rescinded methane emissions standards for the production and processing segments.  ",
        "From time to time, there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.  In addition, there were proposals and positions taken by President Biden during his campaign regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and waters.

        "In addition to the above-described federal regulations, some state and local governments have imposed, or have considered imposing, various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells; testing of nearby water wells; restrictions on access to, and usage of, water; disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations; restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations; and restrictions on drilling or injection activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas, and other protected areas.  Such federal, state and local permitting and disclosure requirements, operating restrictions, conditions or prohibition could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, moreover, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing.",

        "Effective June 30, 2020, the Company ceased offering domestic payday and installment loans and no longer has any unsecured consumer lending or credit services operations in the U.S. or Latin America. The Company remains subject to significant regulation of its pawn and general business operations in all of the jurisdictions in which it operates. These regulations are implemented through various laws, ordinances and regulatory pronouncements from federal, state and municipal governmental entities in the U.S. and Latin America. These regulatory bodies often have broad discretionary authority over the establishment, interpretation and enforcement of such regulations. These regulations are subject to change, sometimes significantly, as a result of political, economic or social trends, events and media perception.",
        "The Company is subject to specific laws, regulations and ordinances primarily concerning its pawn lending operations. Many statutes and regulations prescribe, among other things, the general terms of the Company’s pawn loan agreements, including maximum service fees and/or interest rates that may be charged and collected and mandatory consumer disclosures. In many municipal, state and federal jurisdictions in both the U.S. and countries in Latin America, the Company must obtain and maintain regulatory store operating and employee licenses and comply with regular or frequent regulatory reporting and registration requirements, including reporting and recording of pawn loans and transactions, pawned collateral, used merchandise purchased from the general public, retail sales activities, firearm transactions, export, import and transfer of merchandise, and currency transactions, among other things.",
        "The Company is subject to numerous other types of regulations including, but not limited to, regulations related to securities and exchange activities, including financial reporting and internal controls processes, data protection and privacy, tax compliance, health and safety, labor and employment practices, import/export activities, real estate transactions, credit card transactions, marketing, advertising and other general business activities.",
        "There can be no assurance that the current domestic and international political climate will not change and negatively affect the Company’s business, or that additional local, state or federal statutes, regulations or edicts will not be enacted or that existing laws and regulations will not be amended, decreed or interpreted at some future date that could prohibit or limit the ability of the Company to profitably operate any or all of its services. For example, such regulations could restrict the ability of the Company to offer pawn loans, significantly decrease or cap the interest rates or service fees for such lending activities, prohibit or more stringently regulate the acceptance of pawn collateral or buying used merchandise and the sale, exportation or importation of such pawn merchandise, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial condition. If legislative, regulatory or other arbitrary actions or interpretations are taken at a federal, state or local level in the U.S. or countries in Latin America which negatively affect the pawn industry where the Company has a concentrated or significant number of stores, those actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business operations.

In recent years, additional legislation and regulations have been enacted or proposed which have increased or could continue to increase regulation of the consumer finance industry.",
        "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), created by Title X of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), has broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over certain financial institutions. The CFPB’s examination authority permits examiners to inspect the Company’s books and records and ask questions about its business and its practices relating to unsecured, small dollar loans, like payday loans, which the Company offered before June 30, 2020. The CFPB also has the authority to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for actual or perceived violations of federal consumer laws (including the CFPB’s own rules). In these proceedings, the CFPB can seek civil investigative demands, consent orders, confidential memorandums of understandings, obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for redisclosure, restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as affirmative or injunctive relief) and monetary penalties. Also, where a company has been found to have violated consumer laws, the Dodd-Frank Act (in addition to similar state consumer laws) empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring administrative or civil actions seeking the same equitable relief available to the CFPB, in addition to state-led enforcement actions and consent orders. If the CFPB or one or more state officials believe that the Company violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its business.",
        "On October 5, 2017, the CFPB released its small-dollar loan rule (the “SDL Rule”), which was subsequently revised on July 7, 2020. Traditional possessory, non-recourse pawn loans were not covered under the CFPB’s original 2017 regulation and remain excluded under the revised regulation. Accordingly, the Company believes that the SDL Rule does not directly impact the vast majority of its pawn products, which comprise more than 99% of its total revenues. The SDL Rule does, however, define consumer loan products, both short-term loans and installment loans offered by the Company before June 30, 2020, as loans covered under the rule. Given the Company’s discontinuance of consumer loans and credit services on June 30, 2020, the Company does not believe the SDL Rule will have a material effect, if any, on the Company’s operations and financial condition.",
        "In July 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense published a finalized set of additional requirements and restrictions under the Military Lending Act (“MLA Rule”). The MLA Rule, which went into effect on October 3, 2016, amended requirements for its “safe  harbor” (making covered member attestation insufficient on its own to comply with the “safe harbor” provision of the MLA Rule) and expanded the scope of the credit products covered by the MLA to include overdraft lines of credit, pawn loans, or vehicle and certain unsecured installment loan products to the extent any such products have a military annual percentage rate greater than 36%. While the Company does not believe that active members of the U.S. military or their dependents comprise a significant percentage of the historical pawn customer base in most locations, compliance with the MLA Rule, including its safe harbor provisions, is complex, increases compliance risks and related costs and limits the potential customer base of the Company.",

The BSA is a comprehensive U.S. federal anti-money laundering (“AML”) and counter-terrorism financing statute. The BSA authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations requiring banks and other financial institutions to take a number of precautions against financial crimes, including the establishment of AML programs and the filing of certain reports. The Secretary of the Treasury has delegated to the Director of FinCEN the authority to implement, administer, and enforce compliance with the BSA and associated regulations, which among other things, regulates the reporting of transactions involving currency in an amount greater than $10,000. As of January 1, 2018, the Company ceased offering fee-based check cashing services and is no longer considered a money services business as defined under federal law.

Additionally, these statutes and regulations in various jurisdictions restrict or prohibit the Company from transferring and/or relocating its pawn licenses and restrict or prohibit the issuance of new licenses. The Company’s fee structures are at or below the applicable rate ceilings adopted by each of these states. The Company offers its pawn and retail customers an interest free layaway plan which complies with applicable state laws. In addition, the Company is in compliance with the net asset requirements in states where it is required to maintain certain levels of liquid assets for each pawn store it operates in the applicable state.

The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a state non-member bank, to assess the bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take that record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the bank. Under the FDIC’s CRA evaluation system, the FDIC focuses on three tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its service areas; (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices. Receipt of a \"Needs to Improve\" or \"Substantial Noncompliance\" ratings can, among other things, obstruct regulatory approval for new branches and mergers.

The Federal Reserve Board has similar authority with respect to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have issued policy statements which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Regulatory pressures to reclassify and charge off loans and to establish additional loan loss reserves can have the effect of reducing current operating earnings and thus impacting an institution’s ability to pay dividends.  Further, as described herein, the regulatory authorities have established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by a bank or bank holding company under their jurisdiction. Compliance with the standards set forth in these policy statements and guidelines could limit the amount of dividends which the Company and Lakeland may pay. Banking institutions that fail to maintain the minimum capital ratios, or that maintain the requisite minimum capital ratios but do so at a level below the minimum capital ratios plus the applicable capital conservation buffer, will face constraints on their ability to pay dividends. See “Capital Requirements” below.",

        "Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations, specifying the levels at which a financial institution would be considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized,” and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution. To qualify to engage in activities as a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, all depository institutions must be “well capitalized.” The financial holding company of a bank will be put under directives to raise its capital levels or divest its activities if the depository institution falls from that level.",
        "In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Comptroller of the Currency adopted final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Basel Rules”). The Basel Rules implemented the Basel Committee’s December 2010 framework, commonly referred to as Basel III, for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, as discussed below. The Basel Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including the Company and Lakeland, compared to prior U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. The Basel Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing risk-weighting approach, which was derived from Basel I capital accords of the Basel Committee, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the Basel Committee’s 2004 Basel II capital accords. The Basel Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules. ",

        "For bank holding companies and banks like the Company and Lakeland, January 1, 2015 was the start date for compliance with the revised minimum regulatory capital ratios and for determining risk-weighted assets under what the Basel Rules call a “standardized approach.” As of January 1, 2015, the Company and Lakeland were required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets:",

For example, mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income were required to be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one of those categories exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceeded 15% of CET1. However, subsequent regulatory amendments raised the limit on mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets to 25% of CETI and removed the aggregate limit.",

Under the Basel Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive income items are not excluded; however, banking organizations such as the Company and Lakeland were permitted to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items effective as of January 1, 2015. Lakeland Bancorp and Lakeland Bank made such an election to continue to exclude these items. ",
        "While the Basel Rules generally require the phase-out of non-qualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock, holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, such as the Company, were permitted to permanently include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010 in Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature.",
        "The Basel Rules prescribe a standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets that expands the risk-weighting categories from the previous four categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. Government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the Basel Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.

        "Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Basel Rules adopt alternatives to credit ratings for calculating the risk-weighting for certain assets.",
        "With respect to Lakeland, the Basel Rules revise the “prompt corrective action” regulations under Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each capital quality level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status (a new standard); (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (increased from 6%); and (iii) requiring a leverage ratio of 5% to be well-capitalized (increased from the previously required leverage ratio of 3% or 4%). The Basel Rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any “prompt corrective action” category. ",

        "Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (“DRR”), that is, the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits. The FDIC adopted a plan under which the DIF will meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%. In March 2016, the FDIC adopted a rule that imposes a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. The surcharge equaled an annual rate of 4.5 basis points applied to the institution’s assessment base, with certain adjustments. When the DIF Reserve Ratio is at or above 1.38% in a given quarter, credits were applied to banks' assessment payments. The Company began receiving the Small Bank Assessment credit in the third quarter of 2019 and, as a result, made no FDIC assessment payments in the third and fourth quarter of 2019. Full payments to the FDIC resumed in the second quarter of 2020. The Company paid $2.1 million in total FDIC assessments in 2020 and $431,000 in 2019."

The following is a brief summary of certain aspects of the regulation of the Company and the Bank and does not purport to fully discuss such regulation.

The Dodd-Frank Act implemented far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape.  Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act have been affected by the more recently enacted Economic Growth Act, as defined and discussed below under “-Economic Growth Act.” ",
        "Capital Rules. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulatory capital rules that substantially amend the risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The rules implement the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. “Basel III” refers to various documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. For the Company and the Bank, the general effective date of the rules was January 1, 2015, and, for certain provisions, various phase-in periods and later effective dates apply. The chief features of these rules are summarized below.",
        "Economic Growth Act. In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”), was enacted to modify or eliminate certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Economic Growth Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these amendments could result in meaningful regulatory changes.",
        "The Economic Growth Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of between 8 and 10 percent. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules. Effective January 1, 2020, the Community Bank Leverage Ratio was 9.0%. In April 2020, pursuant to the CARES Act, the federal bank regulatory agencies announced the issuance of two interim final rules, effective immediately, to provide temporary relief to community banking organizations.  Under the interim final rules, the Community Bank Leverage Ratio requirement is a minimum of 8% for the remainder of calendar year 2020, 8.5% for calendar year 2021, and 9% thereafter.  The Company and the Bank have chosen to not utilize the new Community Bank Leverage Ratio due to the Company’s size and complexity, including its commercial real estate and construction lending concentrations and significant off-balance sheet funding commitments.

The FRB may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period (not exceeding five years) specified by the statutory law of the host state. Federal law also prohibits the FRB from approving such an application if the applicant (and its depository institution affiliates) controls or would control more than 10% of the insured deposits in the United States or if the applicant would control 30% or more of the deposits in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch and in which the applicant or any of its depository institution affiliates controls a depository institution or branch immediately prior to the acquisition of the target bank. Federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state which may be held or controlled by a bank or bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Individual states may also waive the 30% state-wide concentration limit. Missouri law prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring a depository institution if total deposits would exceed 13% of statewide deposits excluding bank certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more, deposits from sources outside the United States and deposits of banks other than banks controlled by the bank holding company.",

The FRB also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, a bank holding company may be prohibited from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is not adequately capitalized, and dividends payable by a bank holding company and its depository institutions subsidiaries can be restricted if the capital conservation buffer requirement is not met. See “Capital” below.",
        "A bank holding company is required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the FRB. This notification requirement does not apply to any company that meets the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies, is well-managed, and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues. Under Missouri law, the Bank may pay dividends from certain undivided profits and may not pay dividends if its capital is impaired.

CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) unless an institution has elected to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain conditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets.

The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems or that has inadequate capital to borrow funds to pay dividends.

        "For purposes of the regulatory capital requirements, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital contains capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that made such an election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income “AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). The Bank exercised the opt-out and therefore does not include AOCI in its regulatory capital determinations. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.",
        "In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (such as recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien 1-4 family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.",

The capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in starting on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. At December 31, 2020, the Bank exceeded the fully phased in regulatory requirement for the capital conservation buffer.",
        "The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act enacted in May 2018 required the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to establish for banks with assets of less than $10 billion of assets a community bank leverage ratio (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) of 8% to 10%. A qualifying community bank with capital meeting the specified requirements (including off balance sheet exposures of 25% or less of total assets and trading assets and liabilities of 5% or less of total assets) and electing to follow the alternative framework is considered to meet all applicable regulatory capital requirements including the risk-based requirements. The community bank leverage ratio was established at 9% Tier 1 capital to total average assets, effective January 1, 2020. A qualifying bank may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. A bank that ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two-quarter grace period to comply with the community bank leverage ratio requirements or the general capital regulations by the federal regulators. In addition, Section 4012 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020 required that the community bank leverage ratio be temporarily lowered to 8%. The federal regulators issued a rule making the lower ratio effective April 23, 2020. The rules also established a two-quarter grace period for a qualifying community bank whose leverage ratio falls below the 8% community bank leverage ratio requirement so long as the bank maintains a leverage ratio of 7% or greater. Another rule was issued providing for the transition back to the 9% community bank leverage ratio, increasing the ratio to 8.5% for calendar year 2021 and to 9% thereafter.

An institution is deemed to be “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater and generally a leverage capital ratio of 4% or greater. An institution is deemed to be “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5% or generally a leverage capital ratio of less than 4%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or a leverage capital ratio of less than 3%. An institution is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.",
        "“Undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth, capital distribution (including dividend), and other limitations, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. An institution’s compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the bank’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” Significantly undercapitalized institutions are subject to one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, a regulatory order requiring them to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized; requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, or dismiss directors or officers; and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the parent holding company.",

Employees who achieve the points threshold receive reductions in medical premiums or funds towards their health savings accounts.  We believe this program enhances employee wellbeing and reduces medical costs. ",

        "  future. Our hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced rising labor costs. In some markets, nurse and medical support personnel availability has become a significant operating issue to health care providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity.  Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time.  We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. If there is additional union organizing activity or a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios.

To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity.  Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time.  We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. If there is additional union organizing activity or a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios.

We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. If there is additional union organizing activity or a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, it is possible our labor costs could increase. When negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there is the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit admissions in order to meet the required ratios. If our labor costs increase, we may not be able to offset these increased costs as a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations.  We may be unable to attract, hire, and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, including key management.  The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. In addition, institutional knowledge may be lost in any potential managerial transition.

Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success.  Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.  The success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting and utilization practices of those physicians, maintaining good relations with those physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. Although we employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees of the hospitals at which they practice, and, in many of the markets we serve, most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. We continue to face increasing competition to recruit physicians. Such physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. We may face increased challenges in this area as the physician population reaches retirement age, especially if there is a shortage of physicians willing and able to provide comparable services. If we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their patients, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline.  Risks related to technology, data privacy and cybersecurity:  We may not be reimbursed for the cost of expensive, new technology.  As health care technology continues to advance, the price of purchasing such new technology has significantly increased for providers. Some payers have not adapted their payment systems to adequately cover the cost of these technologies for providers and patients. If payers do not adequately reimburse us for these new technologies, we may be unable to acquire such technologies or we may nevertheless determine to acquire or utilize these technologies in order to treat our patients. In either case, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.    48   ",

        "During 2020, the Company corrected an immaterial accounting error related to $885,000 of DTAs recorded in years prior to 2020 by the holding company. These DTAs were related to state net operating losses (“NOLs”) which accumulated over the span of many years. As the holding company has not previously generated taxable income and continues to generate no taxable income, it has no ability to utilize the NOLs. To correct this immaterial accounting error, the Company recorded an adjustment to 2019's opening retained earnings in the amount of $793,000 and additional tax expense of $92,000 (the amount deemed applicable for 2019) for the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.",

Generally, a change in the assumption used for prepayment speeds would have been accompanied by a directionally similar change in the markets, i.e. the 10-Year Treasury, and in the probability of default.",

Generally, a change in the assumption used for prepayment speeds would have been accompanied by a directionally similar change in the markets, i.e. the 10-Year Treasury, and in the probability of default.",

        "Our labor force is heavily unionized, and our obligations under collective bargaining agreements and labor laws subject us to the risks of work interruption or stoppage and could cause our costs to be higher.",
        "    Most of our employees, most notably at our manufacturing facilities, are subject to collective bargaining agreements and union contracts with terms that expire on varying dates. Several of our collective bargaining agreements and union contracts are of limited duration and, therefore, must be re-negotiated frequently. As a result, we are at greater risk of work interruptions or stoppages than non-unionized companies, and any work interruption or stoppage could significantly impact the volume of products we have available for sale. In addition, collective bargaining agreements, union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to streamline existing manufacturing facilities, restructure our business or otherwise reduce our labor costs because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions.",
        "Our ability to recruit, develop, train and retain qualified and skilled employees could impact our ability to execute strategies.",
        "    Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to recruit, develop, train and retain qualified employees with the relevant education, background and experience. Equally we must be able to retain such skilled employees through our efforts to develop, train, compensate and engage them. Failure to do so could impair our ability to execute our business strategies and could ultimately impact our performance."

        "  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  We recognize that a diverse set of perspectives is critical to innovation and have built a diverse and inclusive workforce that includes all genders, races, and ages, as well as those in the disabled community. We actively seek candidates from different backgrounds and outside traditional fields and reinforce our commitment to diversity through organizational policies, such as mandating fairness and equality for all employees and creating performance appraisal systems that are non-discriminatory.  In 2019, we launched the Women’s Initiative Network, or WIN, an employee-led network designed to provide opportunities and support from all genders for women at WisdomTree; career development and professional training opportunities; and female empowerment and leadership within the organization. Since inception, WIN has held several successful global events including a panel discussion on women in the workforce featuring notable guest speakers; an interactive seminar on negotiation skills; workshops and coaching sessions to enhance confidence to speak up; and various roundtable forums, informal coffee catch-ups and virtual happy hours to promote connectivity while working remotely.  We pride ourselves on the ethnic diversity of our employee base globally and seek to continuously strengthen our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. In 2020 we partnered with a third-party consulting firm to assist us in developing a DEI strategic plan. The objectives of this plan include driving clarity and accountability around our commitment to fostering an inclusive culture where employees feel empowered to do their best work; building trust across differences to ensure employees feel a sense of community and belonging; providing clear paths for growth and development opportunities; and encouraging diverse voices and perspectives. In addition, we are in the process of establishing a global DEI council of senior leaders and employees to provide oversight and guidance as we implement programs contemplated by our strategic plan to increase diversity and promote inclusion.  Employee Wellness, Health and Safety  The wellbeing of our employees is a primary focus. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we established a committee that led a coordinated strategy and acted quickly, implementing significant changes across the organization to protect our people. Our entire global workforce transitioned seamlessly and has been working remotely and successfully throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We provided frequent communications to keep our employees informed about health, safety and remote working logistics and introduced expanded health, wellness and other benefits. For example, we support employees with their information technology needs, provide a monthly stipend to cover remote work-related business expenses and provide guidance for managers to ensure that employees remain connected and maintain physical, mental and emotional wellbeing. We also offer numerous wellness programs including meditation and yoga classes, health webinars, a weekly wellness newsletter and access to mental health professionals and other resources. We also transitioned to flexible paid time-off and sick leave policies to provide employees additional flexibility.  As the virtual work environment has led to efficiencies, increased transparency and further collaboration throughout our business, we have adopted a “remote first” philosophy with plans to significantly reduce our office footprints in New York and London. This means that when we are able to safely meet in person, time in the office will no longer be prescribed, and individuals and teams will be empowered to determine how they work best, based on their role, while remaining accountable for achieving individual and team outcomes. This decision was made after soliciting feedback from our employees, a significant number of which were highly supportive of these plans.  Compliance, Training and Development  We comply with all applicable government laws, rules and regulations and it is the responsibility of each employee to adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed by those laws, rules and regulations. Our employees are required to attend firmwide annual compliance training and to complete compliance certifications annually and in some instances, quarterly.  As we believe that our employees are our greatest asset, we recognize the importance of investing in their continued development. We provide a variety of opportunities for our employees to build new skills and further their career development. These include job-specific training courses, virtual executive lunches and webinars hosted by various departments to gain a holistic view of the company. We also support employees continuing education, including through our educational reimbursement program. In addition, we invest in our current and future leaders through leadership development courses and coaching. We also hold monthly town halls to inform our employees of business developments and job openings for those seeking career development opportunities.  Employee Engagement    We believe engaging our employees is key to fostering new ideas and driving commitment and productivity. We communicate frequently and transparently with our employees through a variety of communication methods, including monthly town halls, firmwide weekly emails championing the team’s work and global virtual lunches with firm leaders. We also seek feedback from our employees through annual engagement surveys and follow-up pulse surveys on various topics.    We also believe it is important to celebrate employee and company accomplishments. In November 2020, we launched our first annual “Team Alpha” Awards to celebrate significant events and successes and to recognize employees who led those successes while exhibiting extraordinary teamwork and demonstrating strong character. Over 90 nominations were submitted and narrowed down by a selection committee. The winners received a modest incentive compensation award, the opportunity to donate to a charity of their choice and to recognize other employees who assisted them.    12   ",

Our incentive compensation program has been designed to reward our employees for their individual performance as well as the Company’s performance and includes various quantitative metrics and qualitative results that incentivize growth. We believe a key factor in our success has been and continues to be fostering an entrepreneurial culture where our employees act and think like our owners. As such, we believe that equity awards are an important part of our employees’ overall compensation package and that incentivizing our employees with equity aligns the interests of our employees with our stockholders. We also offer a wide array of benefits including generous healthcare coverage, paid vacation, parental, sabbatical and sick leave, life insurance, short- and long-term disability benefits and a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution of up to 50% of eligible employee contributions.

This category also includes our cryptocurrency product, the WisdomTree Bitcoin ETP. Our currency products provide investors with exposure to developed and emerging markets currencies, as well as exposures to foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Total AUM of our Commodity & Currency products was $26.0 billion at December 31, 2020.      U.S. Equity  We offer equity products that provide access to the securities of large, mid and small-cap companies located in the U.S., as well as particular market sectors and styles. Our U.S. Equity products track our own indexes, the majority of which are fundamentally weighted as opposed to market capitalization weighted indexes, which assign more weight to stocks with the highest market capitalizations. These fundamentally weighted indexes focus on securities of companies that pay regular cash dividends or on securities of companies that have generated positive cumulative earnings over a certain period. We believe weighting equity markets by dividends and income, rather than by market capitalization, can provide investors with better risk-adjusted returns over longer term periods in core equity exposures. Total AUM of our U.S. Equity products was $18.4 billion at December 31, 2020.  International Developed Market Equity  Our International Developed Market Equity products offer a variety of strategies including currency hedged and dynamic currency hedged products, exposures to large, mid and small-cap companies in these markets and multifactor strategies. Included within this family are DXJ and HEDJ. Total AUM of our International Developed Market Equity products was $9.4 billion at December 31, 2020.  Emerging Market Equity  Our Emerging Market Equity products provide access to exposure of large, mid and small-cap companies located in Taiwan, China, India, Russia, South Africa, South Korea and other emerging markets regions.

Total AUM of our Emerging Market Equity products was $8.5 billion at December 31, 2020.  Fixed Income  Our Fixed Income products seek to enhance income potential within the fixed income universe. We offer a suite of rising rate bond products based on leading fixed income benchmarks we license from third parties. We also launched the industry’s first smart beta corporate bond suite. Other product offerings include those that seek to track a yield-enhanced index of U.S. investment grade bonds and international fixed income products which are denominated in either local or U.S. currencies.

Our employees may also submit a request to the foundation for a financial contribution to support the charitable efforts of an organization they support. During 2020, the foundation, which is managed by our employees, donated medicines and health care products to assist in the global fight against the COVID-19 virus.",

The purpose of the Bausch Health Patient Assistance Program is to provide eligible unemployed patients in the U.S., who have lost their health insurance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with certain of our prescription products although their financial circumstances or insurance status may otherwise interfere with their ability to do so. If approved, patients receive their Bausch Health Companies Inc. prescription product(s) at no cost to them for up to one year, and may be able to reapply to the program annually if they continue to meet eligibility requirements and have a valid prescription.",

In recent years, we have made steady progress to increase the overall representation of employees who identify as women and as African American/Black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and two or more races (together, multicultural talent). As of December 31, 2020, women represented 30 percent of our Board of Directors, and 47 percent of our employees. In addition, 34 percent of employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico identified as multicultural. ",

As of December 31, 2020, 40 percent of employees in management roles are women and 21 percent are multicultural. We were proud to be a globally recognized leader for workplace inclusion, named a Top 10% Inclusion Index Company by Diversity Best Practices in 2020. Our Executive Committee and our Board of Directors have oversight over employee diversity metrics and hiring trends. As evidence of our commitment to expand diversity, equity and inclusion, we have introduced a human capital performance metric to our 2021 Annual Bonus Plan. Our Executive Committee will be measured against global gender and U.S. (inclusive of Puerto Rico) multicultural goals, leadership bench retention goals and performance against annual renewable energy and recycling index goals.",

We regularly benchmark salaries, conduct annual internal and external parity audits and review pay recommendations company wide. In addition, we periodically contract with an independent, third party to assess pay equity across all positions. Our most recent analysis showed that our global workforce had a less than one percent statistical difference in pay along gender lines.

Instilling our culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. We offer our employees the opportunity to participate in ongoing educational offerings and periodic seminars through Goldman Sachs University (GSU). To accelerate their integration into the firm and our culture, new hires have the opportunity to receive training before they start working and orientation programs with an emphasis on culture and networking, and nearly all employees participate in at least one training event each year.

We have increased the availability of these resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have continued to evolve and strengthen virtual offerings with the aim of maintaining the physical and mental well-being of our employees, enhancing their effectiveness and cohesiveness and providing them with greater opportunities to access support.     \n\n\n\n\n \n\n6\n \nGoldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K    ",

        " Reflecting our efforts to increase diversity, the composition of our most recent partnership class was 27% women, 17% Asian, 7% Black and 5% Hispanic/Latinx, and our most recent managing director class was 29% women, 26% Asian, 4% Black and 2% Hispanic/Latinx. In addition, our 2020 campus analyst class in the Americas was 55% women, 31% Asian, 17% Hispanic/Latinx and 11% Black. These metrics are based on self-identification.  Aspirational Goals. We have set the following aspirational goals:   \n\n\n•\n \n We aim for analyst and associate hiring (which accounts for over 70% of our annual hiring) to achieve representation of 50% women, 11% Black professionals and 14% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 9% Black professionals in the U.K.      \n\n\n•\n \n We aim for women to represent 40% of our vice presidents globally by 2025 and 50% of all our employees globally over time, while also endeavoring for women to comprise 30% of senior talent (vice presidents and above) in the U.K. by 2023.       \n\n\n•\n \n We aim for Black professionals to represent 7% of our vice president population in the Americas and in the U.K., and for Hispanic/Latinx professionals to represent 9% of our vice president population in the Americas, both by 2025.       \n\n\n•\n \n We aim to double the number of campus hires in the U.S. recruited from historically Black colleges and universities by 2025.      Talent Development and Retention  We seek to help our people achieve their full potential by investing in them and supporting a culture of continuous development. Our goals are to maximize individual capabilities, increase commercial effectiveness and innovation, reinforce our culture, expand professional opportunities, and help our people contribute positively to their communities.  Instilling our culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. We offer our employees the opportunity to participate in ongoing educational offerings and periodic seminars through Goldman Sachs University (GSU). To accelerate their integration into the firm and our culture, new hires have the opportunity to receive training before they start working and orientation programs with an emphasis on culture and networking, and nearly all employees participate in at least one training event each year. For our more senior employees, we provide guidance and training on how to manage people and projects effectively, exhibit strong leadership and exemplify the firm’s culture. We are also focused on developing a high performing, diverse leadership pipeline and career planning for our next generation of leaders.  ",

        " Another important part of instilling our culture is our employee performance review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and employees whom they supervise in a 360-degree review process that is integral to our team approach and includes an evaluation of an employee’s performance with respect to risk management, protecting our reputation, adherence to our code of conduct, compliance, and diversity and inclusion principles. Our approach to evaluating employee performance centers on providing robust, timely and actionable feedback that facilitates professional development. We have directed our managers, as leaders at the firm, to take an active coaching role with their teams. In 2021, we implemented “The Three Conversations at GS” through which managers establish goals with their team members at the start of the year, check in mid-year on progress and then close out the year with a conversation on performance against goals.  We believe that our people value opportunities to contribute to their communities and that these opportunities enhance their job satisfaction. We also believe that being able to volunteer together with colleagues and participate in community organizations working on local service projects strengthens our people’s bond with us. Community TeamWorks, our signature volunteering initiative, enables our people to participate in high-impact, team-based volunteer opportunities, including projects coordinated with hundreds of nonprofit partner organizations worldwide. During 2019, our people volunteered over 150,000 hours of service globally through Community TeamWorks, with more than 26,000 employees partnering with approximately 900 nonprofit organizations on over 1,800 community projects. To respond to the interest of our people in helping with the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a series of opportunities during 2020 to support vulnerable populations remotely, including small business owners, students and the elderly.  Wellness  We recognize that for our people to be successful in the workplace they need support in their personal, as well as their professional lives. We have created a strong support framework for wellness, which is intended to enable employees to better balance their roles at work and their responsibilities at home. We have recently made significant additions to this framework, including increasing parental leave to 20 weeks for all employees.

        "  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES     We also introduced a COVID-19 10-day family leave policy, available to our people globally to care for family members due to COVID-19 related illness or meet childcare needs, including homeschooling.  Global Reach and Strategic Locations  As a firm with a global client base, we take a strategic approach to attracting, developing and managing a global workforce. Our clients are located worldwide and we are an active participant in financial markets around the world. As of December 2020, we had headcount of 40,500, offices in over 35 countries and 53% of our headcount was based in the Americas, 19% in EMEA and 28% in Asia. Our employees come from over 160 countries and speak more than 110 languages as of December 2020.  In addition to maintaining offices in major financial centers around the world, we have established key strategic locations, including in Bengaluru, Salt Lake City, Dallas, Singapore and Warsaw. We continue to evaluate the expanded use of strategic locations, including cities in which we do not currently have a presence.  As of December 2020, 36% of our employees were working in one of these key strategic locations, and our goal is to increase this percentage to approximately 40% by the end of 2022. We believe our investment in these strategic locations enables us to build centers of excellence around specific capabilities that support our business initiatives.  Competition  The financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other entities that provide investment banking (including transaction banking), market-making, investment management services, commercial and/or consumer lending, deposit-taking and other banking products and services, as well as those entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, credit card issuers, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, merchant banks, consumer finance companies and financial technology and other internet-based companies. We compete with some entities globally and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. We compete based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, client experience, products and services, innovation, reputation and price.    We have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments.  Consolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors, and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To capitalize on some of our most significant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the U.S.  We also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services, such as independent advisory firms. Some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as described below, our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them.  A number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking, market-making, lending and asset management businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed electronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than those for non-electronic trading. It appears that this trend toward low-commission trading will continue. Price competition has also led to compression in the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it (i.e., bid/offer spread), which has affected our market-making businesses. The increasing prevalence of passive investment strategies that typically have lower fees than other strategies we offer has affected the competitive and pricing dynamics for our asset management products and services. In addition, we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices, and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that may rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution.      \n\n\n\n\n \n\nGoldman Sachs 2020 Form 10-K\n \n7      ",

        "A number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking, market-making, lending and asset management businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed electronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than those for non-electronic trading. It appears that this trend toward low-commission trading will continue.

        "When the closure of our dining rooms in March necessitated the furloughing of approximately 41,000 hourly staff members, the Company funded a variety of support programs in an effort to provide them with stability, including a complimentary daily meal, continuation of insurance benefits during the furlough and contributions to a COVID assistance fund that provided $2.6 million in financial grants during fiscal 2020 to staff members in need. Grants were funded through donations from the Company and its staff members. In more recent instances where we have been required to return to off-premise only restaurant operations in certain jurisdictions, we have continued to offer the complimentary daily meal and benefit protections to our furloughed teams. We believe these benefits have assisted us in maintaining a connection to furloughed staff with the goal of returning them to work as soon as dining rooms reopen."

        "The Oil Pollution Act also expands the authority and capability of the federal government to direct and manage oil spill clean-up and operations, and requires operators to prepare oil spill response plans in cases where it can reasonably be expected that substantial harm will be done to the environment by discharges on or into navigable waters. Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party, such as us, to civil or criminal actions. Although the liability for owners and operators is the same under the Clean Water Act, the damages recoverable under the Oil Pollution Act are potentially much greater and can include natural resource damages.

        "Our activities include the performance of hydraulic fracturing services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, such as shale and other unconventional formations. Due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, including on groundwater quality and seismic activity, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some state and local jurisdictions have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether. Certain politicians have also vocalized support for a nationwide ban on hydraulic fracturing. Additional legislation or regulation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.  These developments could also lead to litigation challenging proposed or existing wells.  Such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the hydraulic fracturing services that we provide for our exploration and production customers, and such efforts could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing or Other Aspects of the Oil and Gas Industry Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.” ",

These laws, rules and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. In addition, new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications. These laws, rules and regulations are subject to frequent change, and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment. ",

        "President Biden and the Democratic Party, which now controls Congress, have identified climate change as a priority, and it is likely that new executive orders, regulatory action, and/or legislation targeting greenhouse gas emissions, or prohibiting, delaying or restricting oil and gas development activities in certain areas, will be proposed and/or promulgated during the Biden Administration.  For example, the acting Secretary of the Department of the Interior recently issued an order preventing staff from producing any new fossil fuel leases or permits without sign-off from a top political appointee, and President Biden recently announced a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of Federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices.  President Biden’s order also established climate change as a primary foreign policy and national security consideration, affirms that achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or before midcentury is a critical priority, affirms the Biden Administration’s desire to establish the United States as a leader in addressing climate change, generally further integrates climate change and environmental justice considerations into government agencies’ decision-making, and eliminates fossil fuel subsidies, among other measures. President Biden also announced that the United States is taking steps to reenter the Paris Agreement.",

These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages. An accident or other event resulting in significant environmental or property damage, or injuries or fatalities involving our employees or other persons could also trigger investigations by federal, state or local authorities. Such an accident or other event could cause us to incur substantial expenses in connection with the investigation, remediation and resolution, as well as cause lasting damage to our reputation, loss of customers and an inability to obtain insurance.",
        "We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance. In general, our contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage. Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers. Our customers and other third parties may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons. Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.",
        "We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our equipment and certain other assets, employer’s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability, workers’ compensation and insurance for other specific risks. We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available, or available on terms that are acceptable to us. While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, a substantial portion of our equipment and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of such equipment or other assets. We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies. For example, we generally maintain a $1.5 million per occurrence deductible on our workers’ compensation insurance coverage, a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our equipment insurance coverage, a $10.0 million per occurrence deductible on our general liability coverage, a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our primary automobile liability insurance coverage, and a $5.0 million per occurrence deductible on our excess automobile liability insurance coverage. We also self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption and most cybersecurity risks, and we do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage. ",
        "Our insurance may not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations. Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions. As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage. There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive, or that our coverage will cover a specific loss. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. ",
        "If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable and recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

We have also partnered with the American Heart Association to provide heart healthy information and programs to our employees and encourage local participation in the AHA annual Heart Walk.  With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we worked tirelessly to source and provide personal protective equipment for our patient facing employees. For employees who were and are not in direct clinical care, we pivoted to a remote work arrangement which continues today and will do so until such time that the majority of the population is vaccinated.  Diversity and Inclusion  We strive to make diversity, equality and inclusion a priority. As of February 1, 2021, approximately 80% of our total headcount was female and approximately 40% of our total headcount identified as part of a minority group. Among our affiliated physicians and other clinical professionals, approximately 70% was female and approximately 35% identified as part of a minority group.

During 2021, our affiliated physicians and advanced practitioners across the organization will participate in our COVID-delayed Clinical Leadership Development Program focused on actively developing and supporting our clinician leaders at Mednax.  Compliance Program and Training  Fundamental to our core values are people and a culture of integrity. Our Compliance Department is led by our Chief Compliance Officer. The Compliance Program is supported by a written Compliance Plan, which details the components, organizational structure and operational aspects of the Compliance Program. Although the Compliance Program is supported by numerous operational policies and procedures, there are some key elements that are critical to its success. These include a Compliance Committee; a written Code of Conduct; new hire and periodic compliance training for all employees; compliance reporting mechanisms; and periodic reports to our board of directors. Annual participation in compliance trainings related to ethics, environment, health and safety, and emergency responses are at 100%.  Health and Well-Being  We care about the health and well-being of our affiliated clinicians, other clinical professionals and our administrative employees and their families and are committed to their health, safety and wellness. We support all of our colleagues in encouraging habits of wellness, increased awareness of factors and resources that contribute to overall well-being and inspire individuals to take responsibility for their own health. When individuals take great care of themselves, we can continue to take great care of our patients and take great care of our business.  We provide all our colleagues access to an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”) that offers free and confidential assessments, short-term counseling, referrals, and follow-up services to employees who have personal and/or work-related problems. Our EAP addresses a broad and complex body of issues affecting mental and emotional well-being, such as alcohol and other substance abuse, stress, grief, family problems, and psychological disorders. EAP counselors also work in a consultative role with managers and supervisors to address employee and organizational challenges and needs.

We rely on critical computerized systems for aircraft maintenance records, flight planning, crew scheduling, employee training, financial records, cyber-security and other processes.  We utilize information systems to maintain records about the maintenance status and history of each major aircraft component, as required by FAA regulations.  Using our information systems, we track aircraft maintenance schedules and also control inventories and maintenance tasks, including the work directives of personnel performing those tasks.  We rely on information systems to track crewmember flight and duty times, and crewmember training status.  The Company’s flight operations systems coordinate flight schedules and crew schedules.  ",
        "We invest significant time and financial resources to acquire, develop and maintain information systems to facilitate our operations.  Our information technology infrastructure includes security measures, backup procedures and redundancy capabilities.  We rely increasingly on software applications, hosted technologies, data transmissions and cybersecurity safe-guards provided by or in conjunction with third parties.  To remain competitive, we must continue to deploy new technologies while controlling costs and maintaining regulatory compliance and security safeguards. ",
        "Regulation",
        "Our subsidiaries’ airline operations are primarily regulated by the DOT, the FAA, and the TSA. Those operations must comply with numerous economic, safety, security and environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. In addition, they must comply with various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations.",
        "Environment",
        "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (\"ICAO\").  In 2016, the EPA issued a finding on greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions from aircraft and its relationship to air pollution.  This finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the EPA’s adoption of a new certification standard for aircraft emissions.  In January 2021, the EPA issued a final rule regarding GHG emissions standards for new aircraft engines consistent with ICAO standards that were adopted in 2017.  The EPA final rule does not apply  to engines on aircraft that are already in service, as is also the case with the ICAO standards.  ",
        "However, the administration of President Biden has stated that it plans to review the EPA emissions standards issued by the prior Administration and, further, the EPA standards have been challenged by several states and environmental organizations.  We cannot predict the results of the Biden administration's review or the outcome of legal challenges to the EPA's final rules.  ",
        "Our subsidiaries’ aircraft meet all currently applicable requirements for engine emission levels.  ",
        "Under the Clean Air Act, individual states or the EPA may also adopt regulations requiring reductions in emissions for one or more localities based on the measured air quality at such localities.  These regulations may seek ",
        "10",
        "to limit or restrict emissions by restricting the use of emission-producing ground service equipment or aircraft auxiliary power units.  Further, the U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered legislation that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future.",
        "In addition, the European Commission has approved the extension of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (\"ETS\") for GHG emissions to the airline industry.  Currently, under the European Union’s ETS, all ABX, ATI and OAI flights that are wholly within the European Union are covered by the ETS requirements, and each year our airlines are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights.  If the airline's flight activity during the year produces carbon emissions exceeding the number of carbon emissions allowances that it had been awarded, the airline must acquire allowances from other airlines in the open market.  Our airlines",
        " operate intra-EU flights from time to time and management believes that such flights are operated in compliance with ETS requirements.",
        "Similarly, in 2016, the ICAO passed a resolution adopting the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. A pilot phase is scheduled to begin in 2021 in which countries may voluntarily participate, followed by a first phase of the program beginning in 2024 that is also voluntary, and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in 2027. The United States has agreed to participate in the two voluntary phases.  ICAO continues to develop details regarding implementation, but compliance with CORSIA will increase our operating costs.",
        "The U.S. has also recently re-entered the Paris climate accord, an agreement among 196 countries to reduce GHG emissions, and the effect of the re-entry by the U.S. on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions, on CORSIA and on other GHG regulation is uncertain.  ",
        "The federal government generally regulates aircraft engine noise at its source. However, local airport operators may, under certain circumstances, regulate airport operations based on aircraft noise considerations. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 provides that, in the case of Stage 3 aircraft (all of our operating aircraft satisfy Stage 3 noise compliance requirements), an airport operator must obtain the carriers’ consent to, or the government’s approval of, the rule prior to its adoption. We believe the operation of our airline subsidiaries’ aircraft either complies with or is exempt from compliance with currently applicable local airport rules. However, some airport authorities have adopted local noise regulations, and, to the extent more stringent aircraft operating regulations are adopted on a widespread basis, our airline subsidiaries may be required to spend substantial funds, make schedule changes or take other actions to comply with such local rules.",
        "Department of Transportation",
        "The DOT maintains authority over certain aspects of domestic and international air transportation serving the United States, such as consumer protection, accommodation of passengers with disabilities, requiring a minimum level of insurance and the requirement that a company be “fit” to hold a certificate to engage in air transportation. In addition, the DOT continues to regulate many aspects of international aviation, including the award of certain international routes. The DOT has issued to ABX a Domestic All-Cargo Air Service Certificate for air cargo transportation between all points within the U.S., the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The DOT has issued to ATI certificate authority to engage in scheduled interstate air transportation, which is currently limited to all-cargo operations.  ATI's DOT certificate authority also authorizes it to engage in interstate and foreign charter air transportation of persons, property and mail.  Additionally, the DOT has issued to ABX and ATI Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity authorizing each of them to engage in scheduled foreign air transportation of cargo and mail between the U.S. and all current and future U.S. open-skies partner countries, which currently consists of approximately 130 foreign countries.  ABX and ATI also hold exemption authorities issued by the DOT to conduct scheduled all-cargo operations between the U.S. and certain foreign countries with which the U.S. does not have a liberal (\"open-skies\") air transportation agreement.  The DOT has issued to OAI a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for Interstate Charter Air Transportation and a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for Foreign Charter Air Transportation that authorizes it to engage in interstate and foreign charter air transportation of persons, property and mail.  In 2019, the DOT also issued OAI exemption authority to engage in scheduled foreign air transportation of property and mail between the U.S. and all existing and future countries with an open-skies air service agreement with the U.S.",

        "By maintaining these certificates, the Company, through ABX and ATI, can and currently does conduct all-cargo charter operations worldwide subject to the receipt of any necessary foreign government approvals.  Further, the certificates issued to ATI and OAI authorize the air carriers to conduct passenger charter operations worldwide subject to the receipt of any necessary foreign government approvals.  Periodically, the DOT re-examines a company’s managerial competence, financial resources and plans, compliance disposition and citizenship in order to determine whether the carrier remains fit, willing and able to engage in the transportation services it is authorized to provide. ",
        "The DOT has the authority to impose civil penalties, or to modify, suspend or revoke our certificates and exemption authorities for cause, including failure to comply with federal laws or DOT regulations. A corporation or a limited liability company structured like a corporation holding the above-referenced certificates and exemption authorities must continuously qualify as a citizen of the United States, which, pursuant to federal law, requires that (1) it be organized under the laws of the U.S. or a state, territory or possession thereof, (2) that its president and at least two-thirds of its Board of Directors and other managing officers be U.S. citizens, (3) that no more than 25% of its voting interest be owned or controlled by non-U.S. citizens, and (4) that it not otherwise be subject to foreign control. We believe our airline subsidiaries possess all necessary DOT-issued certificates and authorities to conduct their current operations and that each continues to qualify as a citizen of the United States.",
        "Federal Aviation Administration",
        "The FAA regulates aircraft safety and flight operations generally, including equipment, ground facilities, maintenance, flight dispatch, training, communications, the carriage of hazardous materials and other matters affecting air safety. The FAA issues operating certificates and detailed \"operations specifications\" to carriers that possess the technical competence to safely conduct air carrier operations. In addition, the FAA issues certificates of airworthiness to each aircraft that meets the requirements for aircraft design and maintenance. ABX, ATI and OAI believe they hold all airworthiness and other FAA certificates and authorities required for the conduct of their business and the operation of their aircraft.  The FAA has the power to suspend, modify or revoke such certificates for cause and to impose civil penalties for any failure to comply with federal laws or FAA regulations.",
        "The FAA has the authority to issue regulations, airworthiness directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other things, the inspection, maintenance and modification of aircraft and the replacement of aircraft structures, components and parts, based on industry safety findings, the age of the aircraft and other factors. For example, the FAA has required ABX to perform inspections of its Boeing 767 aircraft to determine if certain of the aircraft structures and components meet all aircraft certification requirements. If the FAA were to determine that the aircraft structures or components are not adequate, it could order our airline subsidiaries and other operators to take certain actions, including but not limited to, grounding aircraft, reducing cargo loads, strengthening any structure or component found to be inadequate, or making other modifications to the aircraft.  New mandatory directives could also be issued requiring the Company’s airline subsidiaries to inspect and replace aircraft components based on their age or condition. As a routine matter, the FAA issues airworthiness directives applicable to the aircraft operated by our airline subsidiaries, and our airlines comply, sometimes at considerable cost, as part of their aircraft maintenance program.",
        "In addition to the FAA practice of issuing regulations and airworthiness directives as conditions warrant, the FAA has adopted new regulations to address issues involving aging, but still economically viable, aircraft on a more systematic basis.  FAA regulations mandate that aircraft manufacturers establish aircraft limits of validity and service action requirements based on the number of aircraft flight cycles (a cycle being one takeoff and one landing) and flight hours before widespread fatigue damage might occur.  Service action requirements include inspections and modifications to preclude development of significant fatigue damage in specific aircraft structural areas.  The Boeing Company has provided its recommendations of the limits of validity to the FAA, and the FAA has now approved the limits for the Boeing 757, 767 and 777 model aircraft.  Consequently, after the limit of validity is reached for a particular model aircraft, air carriers will be unable to continue to operate the aircraft without the FAA first granting an extension of time to the operator.  There can be no assurance that the FAA would extend the deadline, if an extension were to be requested.  At this point, we do not foresee a situation in which we would seek an extension from the FAA for an aircraft.",

        "The FAA requires each of our airline subsidiaries to implement a drug and alcohol testing program with respect to all employees performing safety sensitive functions and, unless already subject to testing, contractor employees that engage in safety sensitive functions.

TSA rules also require airlines to adopt and comply with standard aircraft operator security programs, including the manner in which cargo must be screened prior to being loaded on aircraft.  Our airline subsidiaries comply with all applicable aircraft, passenger and cargo security requirements. The TSA has adopted cargo security-related rules that have imposed additional burdens on our airlines and our customers. The TSA also requires each airline to perform criminal history background checks on all employees.  In addition, we may be required to reimburse the TSA for the cost of security services it may provide to the Company’s airline subsidiaries in the future. The TSA holds (and has exercised) authority to issue regulations, including in cases of emergency the authority to do so without advance notice, including issuance of a grounding order as occurred on September 11, 2001. TSA's enforcement powers are similar to the DOT's and FAA's described above.",

        "When operating in other countries, our airlines are subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective countries or, in the absence of such an agreement, the airlines' operating rights are governed by principles of reciprocity. International aviation agreements are periodically subject to renegotiation, and changes in U.S. or foreign governments could result in the alteration or termination of the agreements affecting our international operations.  Commercial arrangements such as ACMI agreements between our airlines and our customers in other countries, may require the approval of foreign governmental authorities.  Foreign authorities may limit or restrict the use of our aircraft in certain countries.  Also, foreign government authorities often require licensing and business registration before beginning operations.  Foreign laws, rules, regulations and licensing requirements governing air transportation are generally similar, in principle, to the regulatory scheme of the United States as described above, although in some cases foreign requirements are comparatively less onerous and in others, more onerous.  Such authorities have enforcement powers generally similar to those of the U.S. agencies described above.",

For example, the European Union (\"E.U.\") General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of E.U. law and increases the requirements related to the protection of personal data, including individual notice and opt-out preferences and public disclosure of significant data breaches.

The Hydrocarbons Law contains provisions on a number of aspects concerning exploration and production operations and contracts, such as national content obligations, unitization, transfers and abandonment.  ",
        "The 2006 Hydrocarbons Law grants the ministry appointed to be responsible for petroleum operations (“Appointed EG Petroleum Ministry”) significantly broad regulatory, inspective and auditing powers concerning the performance of petroleum operations.

        "ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS",
        "General",
        "Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or pollution control. The cost of compliance could be significant. While we are currently complying with and are in good standing with all environmental laws and regulations, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial and damage payment obligations, or the issuance of injunctive relief (including orders to cease operations). Environmental laws and regulations are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. We also are subject to various environmental permit requirements. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which could subject us to liability for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for conduct or conditions caused by prior operators or third parties. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the crude oil and natural gas industry in general, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Although no assurances can be made, we believe that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with existing laws, rules and regulations regulating the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to our existing assets and operations. We cannot predict, however, what effect future environmental regulation or legislation, enforcement policies, or claims for damages to property, employees, other persons, the environment or natural resources could have on us.",
        "In addition, a number of governmental bodies have adopted, have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change and to the lobbying effects of various climate change non-governmental organizations. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us, our joint venture owners, and our ",

        "suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations. For example, in April 2016, 195 nations, including Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and the United States, signed and officially entered into an international climate change accord (the “Paris Agreement”). The Paris Agreement calls for signatory countries to set their own greenhouse gas emissions targets, make these emissions targets more stringent over time and be transparent about the greenhouse gas emissions reporting and the measures each country will use to achieve its greenhouse gas targets. A long-term goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global temperature increase to well below two degrees Celsius from temperatures in the pre-industrial era. The Paris Agreement is effectively a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol treaty, an international treaty aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, to which various countries and regions are parties. In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the United States’ intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, with such withdrawal becoming effective in November 2020. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued written notification to the United Nations of the United States’ intention to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which took effect on February 19, 2021. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation, including the Paris Agreement and any related greenhouse gas emissions targets, potential prices on carbon emissions, regulations or other requirements, will affect our financial condition and operating performance. In addition, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation or impact the marketability of crude oil and natural gas. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels, and changing temperatures. These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production, and financial performance of our operations.",
        "In part because they are developing countries, it is unclear how quickly and to what extent Gabon or Equatorial Guinea will increase their regulation of environmental issues in the future; any significant increase in the regulation or enforcement of environmental issues by Gabon or Equatorial Guinea could have a material effect on us. Developing countries, in certain instances, have patterned environmental laws after those in the U.S. However, the extent that any environmental laws are enforced in developing countries varies significantly.",

Our ability to maintain and increase sales in the future will depend in large part upon our success in increasing our number of active Customers. Our success will also depend on our ability to retain and motivate our existing Associates and attract new Associates to sell our products.  Associates typically market and sell our products on a part-time basis and often engage in other business activities, some of which may compete with us. Our ability to continue to attract and retain active Customers can be affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including each of the other risks identified in this Annual Report.   Our Associates may terminate their services at any time and, like most direct selling companies, we experience a high turnover among new active Customers from year to year. Customers may also stop buying from us at any time and it is challenging to determine why a customer actually stops buying. In 2020, some of our markets, including China, experienced active Customer declines. If our strategies, including our customer experience strategy, do not generate growth in our active Customer base, our operating results could be harmed.

Generally, such amounts are offset by receivables from ceding companies that are repaid by the future regulatory profits from the reinsured block of business.

Competing apartment communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages. Also, some competing apartment communities are newer than our apartment communities, may have different amenities or otherwise be more attractive to a prospective resident. The competitive position of each apartment community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand.

For many years, we have had the capacity to deliver high-quality, digital learning experiences, and we acted quickly to leverage our existing technologies and learning platforms to serve students outside of the traditional classroom setting. In addition to transitioning to fully online delivery, we also effectively moved other essential functions, including student support services and marketing and enrollment, to a fully remote environment. We have communicated with our students, faculty and staff regularly throughout the pandemic to ensure that they remain informed of our response. While Laureate universities continue to deliver learning online, they also are focused on planning for a safe return to campus, when appropriate to do so. Most of our universities are expected to adopt a phased approach, prioritizing classes that require the use of labs and other physical resources.

Under these rules, the RenaissanceRe Group is required to annually prepare and submit to the BMA group GAAP financial statements, group statutory financial statements, a group capital and solvency return (including an EBS) and an FCR. An insurance group must ensure that the value of the insurance group's assets exceeds the amount of the insurance group's liabilities by the aggregate of: (i) the individual minimum solvency margin of each qualifying member of the group controlled by the parent company; and (ii) the parent company’s percentage shareholding in the member multiplied by the member’s minimum solvency margin, where the parent company exercises significant influence over a member of the group but does not control the member (the \"Group Minimum Solvency Margin\"). A member is a qualified member of the insurance group if it is subject to solvency requirements in the jurisdiction in which it is registered. Every insurance group is also required to submit an annual group actuarial opinion when filing its group capital and solvency return. The group is required to appoint an individual approved by the BMA to be the group actuary. The group actuary must provide an opinion on the RenaissanceRe Group’s technical provisions as recorded in the RenaissanceRe Group statutory EBS. Insurance groups are required to maintain available statutory economic capital and surplus to an amount that is equal to or exceeds the value of its group ECR, which is calculated at the end of its relevant year by reference to the BSCR model of the group (the “Group BSCR”) (or an approved internal capital model) provided that the group ECR shall at all times be an amount equal to or exceeding the Group Minimum Solvency Margin. The BMA expects insurance groups to operate at or above a group target capital level, which exceeds the group ECR. The target capital level for insurance groups is set at 120% of its group ECR.

Each party has been working to complete its internal requirements and procedures (such as amending or promulgating appropriate statutes and regulations) in order to satisfy the US-EU Covered Agreement’s substantive and timing requirements. For instance, in June 2019, the NAIC adopted revisions to the Amended Credit for Reinsurance Model Act and Model Regulation (the “2019 Credit for Reinsurance Amendment”).",
        "The US-EU Covered Agreement addresses three areas of prudential insurance and reinsurance supervision: reinsurance, group supervision and the exchange of information between the U.S. and EU. Under the US-EU Covered Agreement, reinsurance collateral requirements will no longer apply to qualifying EU reinsurers that sell reinsurance to the U.S. market, and U.S. reinsurers operating in the EU market will no longer be subject to “local presence” requirements. The US-EU Covered Agreement also establishes group supervision practices that apply only to U.S. and EU insurance groups operating in both territories. For instance, the US-EU Covered Agreement provides that U.S. insurance groups with operations in the EU will be supervised at the worldwide level only by U.S. insurance regulators, and precludes EU insurance supervisors from exercising solvency and capital requirements over the worldwide operations of U.S. insurers.  ",
        "The US-EU Covered Agreement may preempt an inconsistent state law that treats a qualified non-U.S. reinsurer less favorably than a U.S. insurer licensed in that state. The FIO is required under the US-EU Covered Agreement to commence this preemption analysis in April 2021 and to complete this analysis in September 2022. This effectively means that each U.S. state will need to enact the 2019 Credit for Reinsurance Amendments by September 2022, or face possible federal preemption of those provisions in its credit for reinsurance laws that are inconsistent with the US-EU Covered Agreement.",

RSML’s business plan for Syndicate 1458, including maximum underwriting capacity, requires annual approval by Lloyd’s. Lloyd’s may require changes to any business plan presented to it or additional capital to be provided to support the underwriting plan. Lloyd’s also imposes various charges and assessments on its members. We have deposited certain assets with Lloyd’s to support RenaissanceRe Corporate Capital (UK) Limited’s (“RenaissanceRe CCL”) underwriting business at Lloyd’s. Dividends from a Lloyd’s managing agent and a Lloyd’s corporate member can be declared and paid provided the relevant company has sufficient profits available for distribution.",

        " The underwriting capacity of a member of Lloyd’s must be supported by providing a deposit (referred to as “Funds at Lloyd’s” or “FAL”) in the form of cash, securities or letters of credit in an amount determined under the capital adequacy regime of the U.K.’s Prudential Regulation Authority (the “PRA”). The amount of such deposit is calculated for each member through the completion of an annual capital adequacy exercise. Under these requirements, Lloyd’s must demonstrate that each member has sufficient assets to meet its underwriting liabilities plus a required solvency margin. The amount of FAL for Syndicate 1458 is determined by Lloyd’s and is based on Syndicate 1458’s solvency and capital requirement as calculated through its internal model. In addition, if the FAL are not sufficient to cover all losses, the Lloyd’s Central Fund provides an additional level of security for policyholders. ",
        "Restrictions. ",
        "A Reinsurance to Close (“RITC”) generally is put in place after the third year of operations of a syndicate year of account. On successful conclusion of a RITC, any profit from the syndicate’s operations for that year of account can be remitted by the managing agent to the syndicate’s members. If the syndicate’s managing agency concludes that an appropriate RITC cannot be determined or negotiated on commercially acceptable terms in respect of a particular underwriting year, it must determine that the underwriting year remain open and be placed into run-off. During this period, there cannot be a release of the Funds at Lloyd’s of a member of that syndicate without the consent of Lloyd’s.",
        "The financial security of the Lloyd’s market as a whole is regularly assessed by three independent rating agencies (A.M. Best, S&P and Fitch). Syndicates at Lloyd’s take their financial security rating from the rating of the Lloyd’s Market. A satisfactory credit rating issued by an accredited rating agency is necessary for Lloyd’s syndicates to be able to trade in certain classes of business at current levels. RSML and RenaissanceRe CCL would be adversely affected if Lloyd’s current ratings were downgraded.",
        "Intervention Powers",
        ". The Lloyd’s Council has wide discretionary powers to regulate members’ underwriting at Lloyd’s. It may, for instance, withdraw a member’s permission to underwrite business or to underwrite a particular class of business. The Lloyd’s Council may change the basis on which syndicate expenses are allocated or vary the Funds at Lloyd’s requirements or the investment criteria applicable to the provision of Funds at Lloyd’s. Exercising any of these powers might affect the return on the corporate member’s participation in a given underwriting year. If a member of Lloyd’s is unable to pay its debts to policyholders, the member may obtain financial assistance from the Lloyd’s Central Fund, which in many respects acts as an equivalent to a state guaranty fund in the U.S. If Lloyd’s determines that the Central Fund needs to be increased, it has the power to assess premium levies on current Lloyd’s members. The Lloyd’s Council has discretion to call or assess up to 3% of a member’s underwriting capacity in any one year as a Central Fund contribution.",

        "Solvency II and the U.K.’s Domestic Prudential Regime",
        "The European Parliament adopted Solvency II in April 2009 and it came into effect on January 1, 2016. Solvency II represents a risk-based approach to insurance regulation and capital adequacy. Its principal goals are to improve the correlation between capital and risk, effect group supervision of insurance and reinsurance affiliates, implement a uniform capital adequacy structure for (re)insurers across the EU Member States, establish consistent corporate governance standards for insurance and reinsurance companies, and establish transparency through standard reporting of insurance operations. Under Solvency II, an insurer’s or reinsurer’s capital adequacy in relation to various insurance and business risks may be measured with an internal model developed by the insurer or reinsurer and approved for use by the Member State’s regulator or pursuant to a standard formula developed by the European Commission. Following the U.K.'s exit from the EU, and the expiry of the transition period on December 31, 2020, U.K. authorized insurers will be subject to the U.K.'s separate domestic prudential regime. This regime is identical to the Solvency II regime from January 1, 2021, although the two regimes may begin to diverge over time. The U.K. is currently undertaking a review of Solvency II and of the regulatory regime applicable to U.K. authorized insurers and reinsurers.",
        "The PRA granted approval to Lloyd’s internal model application in December 2015. Each year, the PRA requires Lloyd’s to satisfy an annual solvency test which measures whether Lloyd’s has sufficient assets in the aggregate to meet all outstanding liabilities of its members, both current and run-off. If Lloyd’s fails this test, the PRA may require the entire Lloyd’s market to cease underwriting or individual Lloyd’s members may be required to cease or reduce their underwriting. ",
        "RREAG, UK Branch is authorized and regulated in the U.K. by the PRA and by the FCA. RREAG, UK Branch was therefore subject to the Solvency II regime, until January 1, 2021, at which point it became subject to the U.K.’s domestic prudential regime. However, notwithstanding these regulatory changes, RREAG, UK Branch is still not required, nor will it be required under the terms of the U.K.’s domestic prudential regime, to hold capital at the branch level. In light of this and related matters, the PRA granted various modifications and waivers to RREAG, UK Branch from its regulatory reporting requirements.",
        "Change of Control",
        "The PRA and the FCA currently regulate the acquisition of control of insurers, reinsurers and Lloyd’s managing agents which are authorized under the FSMA. Any company or individual that, together with its or his associates, directly or indirectly acquires 10% or more of the shares in such an entity or its parent company, or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more of the voting power in such entity or its parent company, would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of the relevant legislation, as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such entity or its parent company by virtue of their shareholding or voting power in either. A purchaser of 10% or more of RenaissanceRe’s common shares or voting power would therefore be considered to have acquired control of RSML. Under the FSMA, any person or entity proposing to acquire control over an insurer, reinsurer or Lloyd’s managing agent must give prior notification to the PRA and the FCA of their or the entity’s intention to do so. The PRA and FCA would then have 60 working days to consider the application to acquire control. Failure to make the relevant prior application could result in action being taken against RSML by the PRA or the FCA or both of them. Lloyd’s approval is also required before any person can acquire control (using the same definition as for the PRA and FCA) of a Lloyd’s managing agent or Lloyd’s corporate member.",

Thus, as of that date, RenaissanceRe Services of Switzerland AG has ceased to hold any FINMA license. However, RenaissanceRe Services of Switzerland AG has affiliated with a Swiss ombudsman’s office and registered the relevant client advisors with a Swiss recognized client advisor register in accordance with the Swiss Federal Financial Services Act, which has enabled it to continue its distribution activities for insurance-linked securities.

The SST adopts a risk-based and total balance sheet approach whereby reinsurance companies are required to provide a market-consistent assessment of the value of their assets and liabilities. The solvency requirement is met if the available risk-bearing capital exceeds the required target capital. It is then assessed whether the identified available capital can meet the SST requirements and is sufficient to cover the company’s obligations in less favorable scenarios. The European Commission recognized the SST as being of an equivalent standard to European law with an effective date of January 1, 2016. The SST is also automatically equivalent to the standards in the U.K.'s prudential regime following the expiry of the U.K.'s transition period for leaving the EU on January 1, 2021.",
        "In addition, RREAG must establish sufficient technical reserves for its entire reinsurance business activities. RREAG also has to maintain an organizational fund to cover the costs of establishing and developing the business, and for an extraordinary business expansion. The organizational fund usually amounts to up to 50% of the minimum capital (as discussed above) at the start of business operations and subsequently should typically settle at an amount equivalent to around 20% of the minimum capital. The exact minimum amount is determined by FINMA in each individual case.",

        "Moreover, under the ISA, a reinsurance undertaking must be organized in a way that it can, in particular, identify, limit and monitor all material risks. In this context, RREAG must conduct a forward-looking self-assessment of their risk situation and capital requirements at least once a year, and a report on the ORSA must be submitted to FINMA no later than the end of January of the following year.",
