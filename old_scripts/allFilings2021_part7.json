We conduct an annual Colleague Experience Survey to better understand our colleagues’ needs and overall experience at American Express and in 2020, 94 percent of colleagues who participated in the survey said they would recommend American Express as a great place to work. Our 2020 annual company scorecard included talent retention and diversity representation goals to globally increase minority and women representation at management levels and retain our key talent. As of December 31, 2020, female colleagues comprised 52 percent of our global workforce and Asian, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx people represented 19.7 percent, 12.0 percent and 13.0 percent, respectively, of our U.S. workforce based on preliminary data for our 2020 U.S. EEO-1 submission.",

In the few instances where a review has found inconsistencies, we have made adjustments. After making these adjustments, we believe we achieved 100 percent pay equity in 2020 for colleagues across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the United States.",

        "Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act (RLA), which vests in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and CBAs. When an RLA CBA becomes amendable, if either party to the agreement wishes to modify its terms, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed under the RLA and as agreed by the parties. Under the RLA, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and, if no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between the parties, either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation processes, and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare that an impasse exists and proffer binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration and if arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day “cooling off” period commences. During or after that period, a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) may be established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another 30-day “cooling off” period. At the end of this “cooling off” period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may exercise “self-help,” such as a strike, and the airline may resort to its own “self-help,” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments to the CBA and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers.",

        "The DOT, among other things, oversees and regulates domestic and international codeshare agreements, international route authorities, competition and consumer protection matters such as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability. The Antitrust Division of the DOJ, along with the DOT in certain instances, have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters.",
        "The FAA similarly exercises safety oversight and regulates most operational matters of our business, including how we operate and maintain our aircraft. FAA requirements cover, among other things, required technology and necessary onboard equipment; systems, procedures and training necessary to ensure the continuous airworthiness of our fleet of aircraft; safety measures and equipment; crew scheduling limitations and experience requirements; and many other technical aspects of airline operations. Additionally, our pilots and other employees are subject to rigorous certification standards, and our pilots and other crew members must adhere to flight time and rest requirements. In 2021, the FAA is expected to issue a number of rules that will impact us, including regulations mandating certain rest requirements for flight attendants.",
        "The FAA also controls the national airspace system, including operational rules and fees for air traffic control (ATC) services. The efficiency, reliability and capacity of the ATC network has a significant impact on our costs and on the timeliness of our operations.",

        "Airport Access and Operations",
        "Domestically, any U.S. airline authorized by the DOT is generally free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the U.S. and its territories, with the exception of certain airports that require landing and take-off rights and authorizations (slots) and other facilities, and certain airports that impose geographic limitations on operations or curtail operations based on the time of day. Operations at three major domestic airports we serve (JFK and LGA in New York City, and DCA near Washington, D.C.) and many foreign airports we serve (including LHR) are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms that limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period. In addition to slot restrictions, operations at DCA and LGA are also limited based on a so-called “perimeter rule” which generally limits the stage length of the flights that can be operated from those airports to 1,250 and 1,500 miles, respectively.",
        "Our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports, such as Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and LAX where the airport gate and other facilities are currently inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide, or airports such as Dallas Love Field Airport where we have no access to gates at all.",
        "Existing law also permits domestic local airport authorities to implement procedures and impose restrictions designed to abate noise, provided such procedures and restrictions do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system. In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in service or increases in operating costs.",
        "Airline Fares, Taxes and User Fees",
        "Airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation. The DOT maintains authority over certain international fares, rates and charges, but only applies this authority on a limited basis. In addition, international fares and rates are sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries which we serve.",
        "Airlines are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the “ticket tax,” on domestic and international air transportation, and to collect other taxes and charge other fees, such as foreign taxes, security fees and passenger facility charges. Although these taxes and fees are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. These taxes and fees are subject to increase from time to time. The CARES Act provided for a temporary tax holiday from collecting and remitting certain government ticket taxes for tickets purchased between March 28, 2020 and December 31, 2020.",
        "DOT Passenger Protection Rules",
        "The DOT regulates airline interactions with passengers through the ticketing process, at the airport and on board the aircraft. Among other things, these regulations govern how our fares are displayed online, required customer disclosures, access by disabled passengers, handling of long onboard flight delays and reporting of mishandled bags. In 2021, the DOT is expected to implement a number of new regulations that will impact us, including disability rules for accessible lavatories and wheelchair assistance, and refunds for checked bag fees in the event of certain delays in delivery.",
        "International",
        "International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation, including aviation agreements between the U.S. and other countries or governmental authorities, such as the EU and the United Kingdom. Moreover, our alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. The U.S. government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with 130 trading partners, which allow unrestricted route authority access between the U.S. and the foreign markets. While the U.S. has worked to increase the number of countries with which open skies agreements are in effect, a number of markets important to us, including China, do not have open skies agreements.",
        "In addition, foreign countries impose passenger protection rules, which are analogous to, and often meet or exceed the requirements of, the DOT passenger protection rules discussed above.

        "Since shortly after the events of September 11, 2001, substantially all aspects of civil aviation security in the U.S. or affecting U.S. carriers have been controlled or regulated by the federal government through the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Requirements include flight deck security; carriage of federal air marshals at no charge; enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors; fingerprint-based background checks of all employees and vendor employees with access to secure areas of airports; and the provision of certain passenger data to the federal government and other international border security authorities, for security and immigration controls. Funding for the TSA is provided by a combination of air carrier fees, passenger fees and taxpayer funds. Customs and Border Protection, which, like the TSA, is part of the Department of Homeland Security, also promulgates requirements, performs services and collects fees that impact our provision of services. Additionally, we have at times found it necessary or desirable to make significant expenditures to comply with security-related requirements while seeking to reduce their impact on our customers, such as expenditures for automated security screening lines at airports. Our international service further requires us to comply with the civil aviation security regimes imposed at the foreign airports we serve. ",

U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on our operations include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund Act). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental laws and regulations which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements.",
        "Revised underground storage tank regulations issued by the EPA in 2015 have affected certain airport fuel hydrant systems, with modifications of such systems needed in order to comply with applicable portions of the revised regulations. In addition, related to the EPA and state regulations pertaining to storm water management, several U.S. airport authorities are actively engaged in efforts to limit discharges of deicing fluid into the environment, often by requiring airlines to participate in the building or reconfiguring of airport deicing facilities.",

We are conducting investigation and remediation activities to address soil and groundwater conditions at several sites, including airports and maintenance bases. We presently anticipate that the ongoing costs of such activities will not have a material impact on our operations. In addition, we have been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at certain Superfund sites. Our alleged volumetric contributions at such sites are relatively small in comparison to total contributions of all PRPs. Accordingly, we presently anticipate that any future payments of costs at such sites will not have a material impact on our operations.",

        " ICAO originally defined the baseline as the average emissions from covered flights in 2019 and 2020. However, due to the impact of the pandemic on air travel, in June 2020 ICAO determined to remove 2020 from the baseline for the first few years of CORSIA implementation (2021-2023). Accordingly, we do not expect to be required to purchase offset credits over that period, unless the recovery in demand for international travel is unexpectedly strong and exceeds that of 2019 in those years. ",
        "At this time, the costs of complying with our future obligations under CORSIA are uncertain, primarily because of the difficulty in estimating the return of demand for international air travel in the recovery from the pandemic. There is also significant uncertainty with respect to the future supply and price of carbon offset credits and sustainable or lower carbon aircraft fuels that could allow us to reduce our emissions of CO",

        "In March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") as a pandemic, and it continues to spread extensively throughout the United States and the rest of the world. The outbreak of COVID-19 and public and private sector measures to reduce its transmission, such as forced business closures and limits on operations, the imposition of social distancing and orders to work-from-home, stay-at-home and shelter-in-place, have adversely impacted our business and demand for our services. Some businesses have adjusted, reduced or suspended operating activities, which has negatively impacted the markets we serve. We continue to believe that our focus on our strategic strengths, which include talent, our differentiated go-to-market strategy, data management capabilities, and the relevance of our offerings, position us well to navigate a rapidly changing marketplace. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted and will likely continue to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position; however, the extent of the impact will vary depending on the duration and severity of the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 as well as the effectiveness of mass vaccination and other public health efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.",
        "At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we responded swiftly in support of our people, our clients and our communities. To protect our employees, and to do our part in stopping the spread of COVID-19, within days, 95 percent of our global workforce moved to a remote work environment. The majority of our worldwide workforce continues to work from home. We recognized the importance of regular communication to reassure employees and to keep them updated on our plans as the pandemic unfolded, and IPG was recognized with top honors at the Corporate Content Awards North America for its outstanding communication during the pandemic. We adopted an approach of “organized flexibility” to facilitate the new working environments and take into account the need of many employees to work during non-traditional hours and juggle home lives and work responsibilities.  ",
        "We believe we have had significant success in maintaining and continuing to advance the quality of our services notwithstanding extensive changes required by the pandemic. With respect to managing costs, we undertook multiple initiatives, which continue, to align our expenses with changes in revenue. The steps we have taken across our agencies and corporate group include deferred merit increases, freezes on hiring and temporary labor, major cuts in non-essential spending, staff reductions, furloughs in markets where that option is available and salary reductions, including voluntary salary reductions for our senior corporate management team.",
        "Starting in the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through the year, the Company also took restructuring actions to lower our operating expenses structurally and permanently relative to revenue and to accelerate the transformation of our business.

Our revenues are directly dependent upon the advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients and our ability to win new clients. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated, and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. As is customary in the industry, our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 30 to 90 days, although our data management contracts typically have non-cancelable terms of more than one year.",
        "Revenues for the creation and production of advertising or the planning and placement of media are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and, to a lesser extent, on a commission basis. Fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a mark-up. Many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package. This provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreed-upon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods. Commissions are earned based on services provided. ",
        "We also generate revenue from data and technology offerings and in negotiated fees from our public relations, sales promotion, experiential marketing, sports and entertainment marketing, and corporate and brand identity services.",
        "In most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients, as is customary in the advertising and marketing industries. To the extent possible, we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients, and in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges. Generally, we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor in these arrangements.",

The COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governments and others in response\n    have resulted in, and may continue to cause, the slowdown of the businesses of certain of the Company’s customers and the closure\n    of certain of the Company’s customers’ facilities which in turn has reduced and may continue to reduce demand for some of\n    the Company’s products. Additionally, certain of the Company’s products and parts are manufactured overseas. During 2020,\n    the COVID-19 pandemic had delayed supply from certain of the Company’s overseas suppliers. Should these delays reoccur, the Company\n    would be unable to predict the ultimate duration of such disruptions in supply, whether products or parts from other suppliers will also\n    be delayed, whether such disruptions will become material to the Company and whether, if necessary, the Company will be able to secure\n    such products or parts from alternate suppliers on favorable terms or at all.

Upon a grave threat determination by the FSOC, the Federal Reserve must issue rules that require financial institutions subject to the systemic-risk regime to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15 to 1 if the FSOC considers it necessary to mitigate the risk of the grave threat.

        "We are required to periodically submit a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure, commonly referred to as a resolution plan or a living will, to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Through resolution planning, we seek, in the event of our insolvency, to maintain State Street Bank’s role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system, while minimizing risk to the financial system and maximizing value for the benefit of our stakeholders. We have and will continue to focus management attention and resources to meet regulatory expectations with respect to resolution planning. ",
        "We submitted our updated 2019 165(d) resolution plan describing our preferred resolution strategy to the Federal Reserve and FDIC (the Agencies) before July 1, 2019, and our resolution strategy is materially consistent with our prior resolution strategy. In reviewing the 2019 plan, the Agencies noted meaningful improvements over prior plan submissions. The Agencies did not identify any deficiencies in the 2019 plan, but did identify one shortcoming related to the implementation of ",
        "governance mechanisms. We submitted to the Agencies our plan to remediate this shortcoming in line with the expected timeframe. In addition to the above letter, the Federal Reserve and FDIC jointly issued a final rule that was published in the Federal Register on November 1, 2019. This final rule revised the implementation requirements under the Dodd- Frank Act's resolution planning provisions by means of establishing a biennial filing cycle for the U.S. G-SIBs, including State Street. This cycle alternates between a targeted resolution plan, followed two years later by a full resolution plan. The Agencies have published the scope for the upcoming targeted resolution plan to include the core elements of resolution planning and some specific firm level information, including impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. The next resolution plan is due on July 1, 2021.",
        "In the event of material financial distress or failure, our preferred resolution strategy is the SPOE Strategy. The SPOE Strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the Parent Company and pursuant to a support agreement among the Parent Company, SSIF (a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company), our Beneficiary Entities (as defined below) and certain of our other entities, SSIF is obligated, up to its available resources, to recapitalize and/or provide liquidity to State Street Bank and the other entities benefiting from such capital and/or liquidity support (collectively with State Street Bank, “Beneficiary Entities”), in amounts designed to prevent the Beneficiary Entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings. Following the recapitalization of, or provision of liquidity to the Beneficiary Entities, the Parent Company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Beneficiary Entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to a newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of the Parent Company’s claimants. ",
        "Under the support agreement, the Parent Company pre-funded SSIF by contributing certain of its assets (primarily its liquid assets, cash deposits, investments in intercompany debt, investments in marketable securities and other cash and non-cash equivalent investments) to SSIF at the time it entered into the support agreement and will continue to contribute such assets, to the extent available, on an ongoing basis. In consideration for these contributions, SSIF has agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the Parent Company and all of the Beneficiary Entities in accordance with the Parent Company’s capital and liquidity policies. Under the support agreement, the Parent Company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding. SSIF has provided the Parent ",

The support agreement does not obligate SSIF to maintain any specific level of resources and SSIF may not have sufficient resources to implement the SPOE Strategy.",
        "In the event a Recapitalization Event occurs, the obligations outstanding under the Parent Company Funding Notes would automatically convert into or be exchanged for capital contributed to SSIF. The obligations of the Parent Company and SSIF under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement that grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company and SSIF would use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the Beneficiary Entities. SSIF is a distinct legal entity separate from the Parent Company and the Parent Company’s other affiliates. ",
        "In accordance with our policies, we are required to monitor, on an ongoing basis, the capital and liquidity needs of State Street Bank and our other Beneficiary Entities. To support this process, we have established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur. In the event that we experience material financial distress, the support agreement requires us to model and calculate certain capital and liquidity triggers on a regular basis to determine whether or not the Parent Company should commence preparations for a bankruptcy filing and whether or not a Recapitalization Event has occurred. ",
        "Upon the occurrence of a Recapitalization Event: (1) SSIF would not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the Parent Company; (2) the Parent Company would be required to contribute to SSIF any remaining assets it is required to contribute to SSIF under the support agreement (which specifically exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding); (3) SSIF would be required to provide capital and liquidity support to the Beneficiary Entities to support such entities’ continued operation to the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement; and (4) the Parent Company would be expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. No person or entity, other than a party to the support agreement, should rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a Beneficiary Entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement, including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditor's perspective or determining whether ",
        "to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our entities.",
        "A “Recapitalization Event” is defined under the support agreement as the earlier occurrence of: (1) one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or (2) the authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors for the Parent Company to commence bankruptcy proceedings. The thresholds are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support. The SPOE Strategy and the obligations under the support agreement may result in the recapitalization of State Street Bank and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent Company at an earlier stage of financial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms in place. An expected effect of the SPOE Strategy and applicable TLAC regulatory requirements is that our losses will be imposed on the Parent Company shareholders and the holders of long-term debt and other forms of TLAC securities currently outstanding or issued in the future by the Parent Company, as well as on any other Parent Company creditors, before any of our losses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of the Parent Company's operating subsidiaries or any of their depositors or creditors, or before U.S. taxpayers are put at risk.",
        "State Street Bank is also required to submit periodically to the FDIC a plan for resolution in the event of its failure, referred to as an Insured Depository Institution plan. In November 2018, the FDIC announced that until the FDIC completed revisions to its IDI plan requirements, no IDI plans would be required to be filed. In January 2021, the FDIC lifted the moratorium on IDI plan filings for IDIs with $100 billion or more in assets, including State Street Bank. In lifting the moratorium, the FDIC stated that it will provide at least 12 months’ advance notice prior to requiring submission of an institution’s next IDI plan.",

        "Under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial companies, including bank holding companies such as the Parent Company, and certain covered subsidiaries, can be subjected to the orderly liquidation authority which went into effect in 2010. For the FDIC to be appointed as our receiver, two-thirds of the FDIC Board and two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board must recommend appointment, and the U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the U.S. President, must then make certain extraordinary ",

        "The orderly liquidation authority went into effect in 2010, and rulemaking is proceeding incrementally, with some regulations now finalized and others planned but not yet proposed. If the FDIC were appointed as the receiver of the Parent Company pursuant to the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would have considerable powers to resolve the Parent Company, including: (1) the power to remove officers and directors responsible for the Parent Company's failure and to appoint new directors and officers; (2) the power to assign assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review; (3) the ability to differentiate among similarly situated creditors, subject to a minimum recovery right to receive at least what they would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and (4) broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership to creditors not transferred to a third party or bridge financial institution.",
        "In 2013, the FDIC released its proposed SPOE strategy for resolution of a SIFI under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC’s release outlines how it would use its powers under the orderly liquidation authority to resolve a SIFI by placing its top-tier U.S. holding company in receivership and keeping its operating subsidiaries open and out of insolvency proceedings by transferring the operating subsidiaries to a new bridge holding company, recapitalizing the operating subsidiaries and imposing losses on the shareholders and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority.",
        "Derivatives",
        "Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act imposed a comprehensive regulatory structure on the OTC derivatives market, including requirements for clearing, exchange trading, capital, margin, reporting and record-keeping. Title VII also requires certain persons to register as a major swap participant, a swap dealer or a securities-based swap dealer. The CFTC, the SEC, and other U.S. regulators have largely implemented key provisions of Title VII, although certain final regulations have only been in place a short period of time and others have not been finalized. Through this rulemaking process, these regulators collectively have adopted or proposed, among other things, regulations relating to reporting and record-keeping obligations, margin and capital requirements, the scope of registration and the central clearing and exchange trading requirements for certain OTC derivatives. The CFTC has also issued rules to enhance the oversight of clearing and trading entities. The CFTC, along with other ",

As a provisionally registered swap dealer, State Street Bank is subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding its swap activity and the supervision, examination and enforcement powers of the CFTC and other regulators. The CFTC has granted State Street Bank a limited-purpose swap dealer designation. Under this limited-purpose designation, interest rate swap activity engaged in by State Street Bank’s Global Treasury group is not subject to certain of the swap regulatory requirements otherwise applicable to swaps entered into by a registered swap dealer, subject to a number of conditions.

The proprietary radiofrequency (\"RF\") energy is delivered to the handpiece by the ESU and used to energize an electrode. When helium gas passes over the energized electrode, helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam. The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is very precise and cooler in temperature in comparison to other surgical energy modalities such as standard RF monopolar energy.

Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance\nwith respect to financial statement preparation.

We caution readers that these statements are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, which may by their nature be inherently uncertain and some of which may be outside our control. These statements may relate to plans and objectives with respect to the future, among other things which may change. We are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the expected objectives or anticipated results that may be suggested, expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.

We seek to manage our labor costs  by improving team member retention, improving operating efficiencies, maintaining competitive benefits and reducing reliance on overtime compensation and temporary nursing agency services.

We compete with other health care providers for both professional and non-professional team members and with non-health care providers for non-professional team members. This competition continues to contribute to a consistent increase in the salaries that we have to pay to hire and retain these team members.

This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals. Because regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative and regulatory debate, we cannot forecast how federal and state regulation and supervision of financial institutions may change in the future and affect Pinnacle’s and First National Bank’s operations.",
        "During 2020, Pinnacle became subject to periodic reporting requirements under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), which include the filing of annual, quarterly and current reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Pinnacle is also required to comply with other laws and regulations of the SEC applicable to public companies.",
        "As a national bank, First National Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the OCC. The prior approval of the OCC or other appropriate bank regulatory authority is required for a national bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the constituent organizations and the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”) and fair housing initiatives, the data security and cybersecurity infrastructure of the constituent organizations and the combined organization, and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities.

        "The regulations of the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC govern most aspects of Pinnacle’s business, including deposit reserve requirements, investments, loans, certain check clearing activities, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, branching, and numerous other matters.  Further, the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines and released interpretive materials that establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safe and sound operation of banks and bank holding companies.  These standards relate to the institution’s key operating functions, including but not limited to internal controls, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation of management, information systems, data security and cybersecurity, and risk management.  As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in the United States, Pinnacle’s business is particularly susceptible to changes in state and federal legislation and regulations, which may have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting permissible activities or increasing competition.",
        "As a bank holding company, Pinnacle is subject to the BHCA, and regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve. A bank holding company is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before making certain acquisitions or engaging in certain activities. Bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions on transactions with insiders and affiliates.",

The approval of the Federal Reserve is also required for the merger or consolidation of bank holding companies.",
        "Pursuant to the BHCA, the Federal Reserve has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or ownership constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.",
        "Pinnacle is required to file periodic reports with the Federal Reserve and provide any additional information the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to examine Pinnacle and its subsidiaries, as well as any arrangements between Pinnacle and its subsidiaries, with the cost of any such examinations to be borne by Pinnacle.  Banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law in dealings with their holding companies and other affiliates.",
        "Regulatory Reform.  The financial crisis of 2008, including the downturn of global economic, financial and money markets and the threat of collapse of numerous financial institutions, and other events led to the adoption of numerous laws and regulations that apply to, and focus on, financial institutions. The most significant of these laws is the Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted on July 21, 2010 and, in part, was intended to implement significant structural reforms to the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act implemented far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including changes that have significantly affected the business of all bank holding companies and banks, including Pinnacle and First National Bank. Some of the rules that have been proposed and, in some cases, adopted to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act’s mandates are discussed further below.",
        "In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”) was enacted to reduce the regulatory burden on certain banking organizations, including community banks, by modifying or eliminating certain federal regulatory requirements. While the EGRRCPA maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion as well as for larger banks with assets above $50 billion. In addition, the EGRRCPA included regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, application of the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures, qualified mortgages, and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans. However, federal banking regulators retain broad discretion to impose additional regulatory requirements on banking organizations based on safety and soundness and U.S. financial system stability considerations.",
        "Pinnacle continues to experience ongoing regulatory reform. These regulatory changes could have a significant effect on how Pinnacle conducts its business. The specific implications of the Dodd-Frank Act, the EGRRCPA, and other potential regulatory reforms cannot yet be fully predicted and will depend to a large extent on the specific regulations that are to be adopted in the future. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and the EGRRCPA are discussed in more detail below.",
        "Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action. The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have adopted risk-based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and banks pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) and the Basel III Capital Accords. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Resources”.",
        "The federal banking agencies have broad powers to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions.  Under the FDICIA, there are five capital categories applicable to bank holding companies and insured institutions, each with specific regulatory consequences. The extent of the agencies’ powers depends on whether the institution in question is “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.”  These terms are defined under uniform regulations issued by each of the federal banking agencies.  If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an insured institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition, it may reclassify the institution to a lower capital category (other than critically undercapitalized) and require the submission of a plan to correct the unsafe or unsound condition.",
        "4",
        " ",
        "Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a financial institution could subject Pinnacle and its subsidiaries to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits, and other restrictions on its business.  In addition, an institution may not make a capital distribution, such as a dividend or other distribution that is in substance a distribution of capital to the owners of the institution if following such a distribution the institution would be undercapitalized. Thus, if the making of such dividend would cause First National Bank to become undercapitalized, it could not pay a dividend to Pinnacle.",
        "Basel III Capital Framework. The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules to implement the Basel III capital framework as outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and standards for calculating risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital measurements (collectively, the “Basel III Capital Rules”) that apply to banking institutions they supervise.  For purposes of these capital rules, (i) common equity Tier 1 capital (“CET1”) consists principally of common stock (including surplus) and retained earnings; (ii) Tier 1 capital consists principally of CET1 plus non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, and certain grandfathered cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities; and (iii) Tier 2 capital consists of other capital instruments, principally qualifying subordinated debt and preferred stock, and limited amounts of an institution’s allowance for loan losses.  Each regulatory capital classification is subject to certain adjustments and limitations, as implemented by the Basel III Capital Rules.  The Basel III Capital Rules also establish risk weightings that are applied to many classes of assets held by community banks, including, importantly, applying higher risk weightings to certain commercial real estate loans.",
        "The Basel III Capital Rules and minimum capital ratios required to be maintained by banks were effective on January 1, 2015. The Basel III Capital Rules also include a requirement that banks maintain additional capital (the “capital conservation buffer”), which was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 and was fully phased in as of January 1, 2019.  As fully phased in, the Basel III Capital Rules require banks to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%), (iii) a minimum ratio of total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, subject to certain adjustments and limitations.",
        "The Basel III Capital Rules provide deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital measures, primarily to CET1, including deductions and adjustments that were not applied to reduce CET1 under historical regulatory capital rules.  For example, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10.0% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15.0% of CET1.",

        "Small Bank Holding Company. The EGRRCPA also expanded the category of bank holding companies that may rely on the Federal Reserve Board’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying bank holding company may have from $1 billion to $3 billion. In addition to meeting the asset threshold, a bank holding company must not engage in significant nonbanking activities, not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities, and not have a material amount of debt or equity securities outstanding and registered with the SEC (subject to certain exceptions). The Federal Reserve Board may, in its discretion, exclude any bank holding company from the application of the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement if such action is warranted for supervisory purposes.",
        "In August 2018, the Federal Reserve Board issued an interim final rule to apply the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement to bank holding companies with consolidated total assets of less than $3 billion. The policy statement, which, among other things, exempts certain bank holding companies from minimum consolidated regulatory capital ratios that apply to other bank holding companies. As a result of the interim final rule, which was effective August 30, 2018, Pinnacle expects that it will be treated as a small bank holding company and will not be subject to regulatory capital requirements. The comment period on the interim final rule closed on October 29, 2018 and, to date, the Federal Reserve has not issued a final rule to replace the interim final rule. First National Bank remains subject to the regulatory capital requirements described above.",

A significant portion of Pinnacle’s revenues result from dividends paid to it by First National Bank. Both Pinnacle and First National Bank are subject to laws and regulations that limit the payment of dividends, including limits on the sources of dividends and requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums. Federal Reserve supervisory guidance indicates that the Federal Reserve may have safety and soundness concerns if a bank holding company pays dividends that exceed earnings for the period in which the dividend is being paid. Generally, dividends paid by First National Bank during a year may not exceed the sum of the bank’s net income in that year and the bank’s retained earnings of the immediately preceding two calendar years without prior approval of the OCC.  Further, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”) prohibits insured depository institutions such as First National Bank from making capital distributions, including paying dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become undercapitalized as defined in the statute. The OCC may prevent First National Bank from paying a dividend if the OCC concludes such dividend would be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. We do not expect that any of these laws, regulations or policies will materially affect the ability of Pinnacle or First National Bank to pay dividends.",

The basic limit on FDIC deposit insurance coverage is $250,000 per depositor. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations as an insured institution, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC, subject to administrative and potential judicial hearing and review processes.",
        "Deposit Insurance Assessments.  The DIF is funded by assessments on banks and other depository institutions calculated based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital). As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted a large-bank pricing assessment scheme, set a target “designated reserve ratio” (described in more detail below) of 2.0% for the DIF and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower assessment rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2.0% and 2.5%. An institution’s assessment rate is based on a statistical analysis of financial ratios that estimates the likelihood of failure over a three-year period, which considers the institution’s weighted average capital adequacy, assets, management capability, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity (“CAMELS”) component rating, and is subject to further adjustments including those related to levels of unsecured debt and brokered deposits (not applicable to banks with less than $10 billion in assets).  At December 31, 2020, total base assessment rates for institutions that have been insured for at least five years range from 1.5 to 30 basis points applying to banks with less than $10 billion in assets.",
        "The Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the FDIC increased discretion with regard to managing the required amount of reserves for the DIF, or the “designated reserve ratio.” The FDIA requires that the FDIC consider the appropriate level for the designated reserve ratio on at least an annual basis. As of December 31, 2020, the designated reserve ratio was 2.0% and the minimum designated reserve ratio was 1.35%.  At December 31, 2020, the reserve ratio was 1.30%. ",

There are statutory restrictions related to the extent bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries may borrow, obtain credit from or otherwise engage in “covered transactions” with their insured depository institution (i.e., banking) subsidiaries. In general, an “affiliate” of a bank includes the bank’s parent holding company and any subsidiary thereof. However, an “affiliate” does not generally include the bank’s operating subsidiaries. A bank (and its subsidiaries) may not lend money to, or engage in other covered transactions with, its non-bank affiliates if the aggregate amount of covered transactions outstanding involving the bank, plus the proposed transaction, exceeds the following limits: (a) in the case of any one such affiliate, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the bank and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 10.0% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus; and (b) in the case of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the bank and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 20.0% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus. “Covered transactions” are defined to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate, a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets from an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company, the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate, securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate, or a derivatives transaction with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate.

The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Pinnacle, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” The findings will be included in reports of examination, and deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.",
        "In addition, in 2016, the SEC and the federal banking agencies proposed rules that prohibit covered financial institutions (including bank holding companies and banks) from establishing or maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing covered persons (consisting of senior executive officers and significant risk takers, as defined in the rules) with excessive compensation, fees or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the financial institution.  The proposed rules outline factors to be considered when analyzing whether compensation is excessive and whether an incentive-based compensation arrangement encourages inappropriate risks that could lead to material loss to the covered financial institution, and establishes minimum requirements that incentive-based compensation arrangements must meet to be considered to not encourage inappropriate risks and to appropriately balance risk and reward.  The proposed rules also impose additional corporate governance requirements on the boards of directors of covered financial institutions and impose additional record-keeping requirements.  The comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not yet been published.",

The federal banking agencies expect financial institutions to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, and also expect financial institutions to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack. If Pinnacle or First National Bank fails to meet the expectations set forth in this regulatory guidance, Pinnacle or First National Bank could be subject to various regulatory actions and any remediation efforts may require significant resources of Pinnacle or First National Bank.

However, the CFPB may include its own examiners in regulatory examinations by a smaller institution’s prudential regulators and may require smaller institutions to comply with certain CFPB reporting requirements. In addition, regulatory positions taken by the CFPB and administrative and legal precedents established by CFPB enforcement activities, including in connection with supervision of larger bank holding companies and banks, could influence how the Federal Reserve and the OCC apply consumer protection laws and regulations to financial institutions that are not directly supervised by the CFPB.

Alternatively, mortgage lenders can originate “qualified mortgages”, which are generally defined as mortgage loans without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, terms exceeding 30 years, and points and fees paid by a consumer equal to or less than 3.0% of the total loan amount. Under the EGRRCPA, most residential mortgages loans originated and held in portfolio by a bank with less than $10 billion in assets will be designated as “qualified mortgages.” Higher-priced qualified mortgages (e.g., subprime loans) receive a rebuttable presumption of compliance with ability-to-repay rules, and other qualified mortgages (e.g., prime loans) are deemed to comply with the ability-to-repay rules.

Medical devices that receive 510(k) clearance are “cleared” by the FDA to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. Medical devices that obtain a PMA by the FDA are “approved” to market, distribute and sell in the United States. We cannot be certain that 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will ever be obtained for any products that have not already obtained 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. Descriptions of the PMA and 510(k) clearance processes are provided below.",
        "The FDA decides whether a device line must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or PMA based on statutory criteria that utilize a risk-based classification system. PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices and, in many cases, Class II medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The FDA uses these criteria to decide whether a PMA or a 510(k) is appropriate, including the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination by the agency of whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either Class I or II. In many cases, the FDA requires the manufacturer to submit a 510(k) requesting clearance (also referred to as a premarket notification), unless an exemption applies. The 510(k) must demonstrate that the manufacturer’s proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed predicate device. A “predicate device” is a pre-existing medical device to which equivalence can be drawn, that is either in Class I or Class II or is a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA application.",

In addition, classification is risk-based, that is, the risk the device poses to the patient and/or the user is a major factor in determining the class to which it is assigned. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk and Class III includes those with the greatest risk.",
        "Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general regulatory controls for medical devices, or the General Controls, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s quality system regulations, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) process described below.",
        "Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) process. Pursuant to the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) submissions are subject to user fees. Certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process.",
        "Class III includes devices with the greatest risk. Devices in this class must meet all of the requirements in Classes I and II. In addition, Class III devices cannot be marketed until they receive Premarket Approval.",
        "The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Under Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, PMA applications (and supplemental premarket approval applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees than 510(k) applications, and they also require considerably more time and resources.",
        "Rapid HIV tests intended for diagnostic use are regulated as Class III devices. Responsibility for assuring the safety and effectiveness of these tests lies within the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research’s Office of Blood Research and Review, with oversight by the Blood Products Advisory Committee. Approved rapid HIV tests must meet the regulations in the 21 CFR 800 series subparts, under the investigational device exemption, or IDE and PMA pathways.",
        "Premarket Approval Pathway",
        "We manufacture, market and distribute three rapid HIV tests in the United States. Our HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK Assay, SURE CHECK HIV 1/2 Assay, and DPP HIV 1/2 Assay all have received FDA PMA approval. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, analytical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing, statutory preapproval inspections, and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. Before a PMA is submitted, a manufacturer must apply for an IDE. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to file an IDE application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to initiation of enrollment of human subjects for clinical trials. The IDE provides the manufacturer with a legal pathway to perform clinical trials on human subjects where without the IDE, only approved medical devices may be used on human subjects.",
        "The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as analytical, animal and laboratory testing results, manufacturing information, and an Investigational Review Board, or IRB approved protocol showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. If the clinical trial design is deemed to have “non-significant risk,” the clinical trial may be eligible for “abbreviated” IDE requirements. In some instances, clinical trials for in vitro diagnostic medical devices may be exempt from the more burdensome IDE requirements if certain labeling requirements are met.",
        "A clinical trial may be suspended by either the FDA or the Investigational Review Board at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. Even if a study is completed, clinical testing results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, or they may be equivocal or otherwise insufficient to obtain approval of the product being tested. After the clinical trials have been completed, if at all, and the clinical trial data and results are collected and organized, a manufacturer may complete a PMA application.",
        "After a PMA application is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the “accepted application,” although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, but it may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The preapproval inspections conducted by the FDA include an evaluation of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the FDA’s quality systems regulations or QSR, as well as inspections of the clinical trial sites by the Bioresearch Monitoring group to evaluate compliance with good clinical practice and human subject protections. New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. Significant changes to an approved PMA require a 180-day supplement, whereas less substantive changes may utilize a 30-day notice, or a 135-day supplement. Premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application, and it may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.",

In some cases the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.",
        "If a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, a PMA. The FDA requires each device manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a new 510(k) or a PMA, but the FDA can review any such decision and, if it disagrees with the manufacturer’s determination, can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA of the modified device is obtained.",

When a test is categorized as waived, it may be performed by laboratories with a Certificate of Waiver, such as a physician’s office outreach setting. In a CW submission, the manufacturer provides evidence to the FDA that a test meets the CLIA statutory criteria for waiver CLIA, a walk-in clinic or an emergency room provides CMS authority over all laboratory testing, except research that is performed on humans in the United States. The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group under the CMS, has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA program.",
        "The CLIA program is designed to establish quality laboratory testing by ensuring the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. Under CLIA, a laboratory is a facility that does laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans and used to provide information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or impairment of, or assessment of health. Under the CLIA program, unless waived, laboratories must be certified by the government, satisfy governmental quality and personnel standards, undergo proficiency testing, be subject to inspections and pay fees. We have received a CLIA waiver for all of our rapid diagnostic rapid HIV tests that we market in the United States. Specifically, the CLIA waiver was granted by the FDA for HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK in November 2006,for SURE CHECK HIV 1/2 in October 2007, and for DPP HIV 1/2 in October 2014.",

In particular, although section 564 allows FDA to issue an EUA for preparedness purposes, in such cases the HHS Secretary must first declare that circumstances exist justifying such an authorization in advance of an actual emergency based on a formal determination of a significant potential for emergency or a material threat determination. During the effective period of the HHS Secretary’s EUA declaration, FDA may authorize the introduction of a medical product into interstate commerce when the product is intended for use during an actual or potential emergency. EUA candidate products include medical products and uses that are not approved, cleared, or licensed under sections 505, 510(k), and 515 of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the PHS Act.",
        "After the requisite determination and declaration have been issued, and after feasible and appropriate consultations, FDA may issue an EUA only if FDA concludes that the following four statutory criteria for issuance have been met for 1) Serious or Life-Threatening Disease or conditions, 2) evidence of effectiveness, 2) Risk –Benefit Analysis, 4) No Alternatives.  A sponsor seeking an EUA can submit its formal request in the form of an EUA submission, which includes data for clinical studies, non-clinical laboratory studies to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product as well as the discussion of Risks and Benefits of the product.",

Concentrations in excess of those guidelines must be approved by either a corporate loan committee comprised\nof the Bank’s Chief Executive Officer, the Credit Risk Manager, and other senior commercial lenders or the Bank’s\nboard of directors. When lending to an entity, the Bank generally obtains a guaranty from the principals of the entity. The loan\nmix is subject to the discretion of the Bank’s board of directors and the demands of the local marketplace.",

        "The\nfollowing is a brief description of each major category of the Bank’s lending activity.",
        " ",
        "One-to-Four\nFamily Residential Real Estate Lending. The Bank originates one-to-four family residential real estate loans with both\nfixed and variable rates. One-to-four family residential real estate loans are typically priced and originated following underwriting\nstandards that are consistent with guidelines established by the major buyers in the secondary market. Generally, residential\nreal estate loans retained in the Bank’s loan portfolio have fixed or variable rates with adjustment periods of seven years\nor less and amortization periods of typically either 15 or 30 years. A significant portion of these loans prepay prior to maturity.\nThe Bank has no potential negative amortization loans. While the origination of fixed-rate, one-to-four family residential loans\ncontinues to be a key component of our business, the majority of these loans are sold in the secondary market. One-to-four family\nresidential real estate loans that exceed 80% of the appraised value of the real estate generally are required, by policy, to\nbe supported by private mortgage insurance, although on occasion the Bank will retain non-conforming residential loans to known\ncustomers at premium pricing. The balances of one-to-four family residential real estate loans increased as of December 31, 2020\ncompared to December 31, 2019 as the Bank decided to retain additional loans as an alternative to purchasing investment securities.\nWhile the Bank retains some of the new loan originations, most of the new loans continue to be sold.",
        " ",
        "Construction\nand Land Lending. Loans in this category include loans to facilitate the development of both residential and commercial\nreal estate. Construction and land loans generally have terms of less than 18 months, and the Bank will retain a security interest\nin the borrower’s real estate. Construction loans are generally limited, by policy, to 80% of the appraised value of the\nproperty. Land loans are generally limited, by policy, to 65% of the appraised value of the property. The origination of construction\nand land loans has not been a primary strategy of the Bank over the past few years to reduce risk in the Bank’s loan portfolio.\nThe balances of construction and land loans increased as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 as a result of increased\nloans to existing customers.",
        " ",
        "Commercial\nReal Estate Lending. Commercial real estate loans, including multi-family loans, generally have amortization periods of\n15 or 20 years. Commercial real estate and multi-family loans are generally limited, by policy, to 80% of the appraised value\nof the property. Commercial real estate loans are also supported by an analysis demonstrating the borrower’s ability to\nrepay. The Bank continues to focus on generating additional commercial real estate loan relationships. The Bank’s loan growth\nover the past few years has been driven in large part by commercial real estate loans. These loans are primarily made to customers\nwith owner-occupied properties.",
        " ",
        " ",
        "Commercial\nLending. Commercial loans include loans to service, retail, wholesale and light manufacturing businesses. Commercial loans\nare made based on the financial strength and repayment ability of the borrower, as well as the collateral securing the loans.\nThe Bank targets owner-operated businesses as its customers and makes lending decisions based upon a cash flow analysis of the\nborrower as well as a collateral analysis. Accounts receivable loans and loans for inventory purchases are generally on a one-year\nrenewable term, and loans for equipment generally have a term of seven years or less. The Bank generally takes a blanket security\ninterest in all assets of the borrower. Equipment loans are generally limited to 75% of the cost or appraised value of the equipment.\nInventory loans are generally limited to 50% of the value of the inventory, and accounts receivable loans are generally limited\nto 75% of a predetermined eligible base. The Bank continues to focus its organic growth on generating additional commercial loan\nrelationships, including SBA loans. The Bank has been able to increase its balances of commercial loans over the past few years\nas a result of recruiting new customer relationships.",
        " ",
        "Paycheck\nProtection Program Lending. Starting in 2020, the Bank participates as a lender in the SBA’s Paycheck Protection\nProgram (“PPP”). PPP is a loan program administered through the SBA to help businesses impacted by COVID-19, with\nthe loans guaranteed by the SBA. The Bank receives an origination fee from the SBA as part of the lending process. The loans have\nan interest rate of 1.00% plus the amortization of the origination fee. The maturity date of these loans is two or five years\nunless the borrower’s loan is forgiven, in which case the loan may be repaid sooner. The Bank’s ability to originate\nPPP loans is dependent upon the extent to which the program is authorized by the federal government to continue in future periods.",
        " ",
        "Municipal\nLending. Loans to municipalities are generally related to equipment leasing or general fund loans. Terms are generally\nlimited to 5 years. Equipment leases are generally made for the purchase of municipal assets and are secured by the leased asset.\nThe Bank is generally not active in the origination of municipal loans and leases; however, the Bank may originate loans or leases\nfor municipalities in its market area.",
        " ",
        "Agriculture\nLending. Agricultural real estate loans generally have amortization periods of 20 years or less, during which time the\nBank generally retains a security interest in the borrower’s real estate. The Bank also provides short-term credit for operating\nloans and intermediate-term loans for farm product, livestock and machinery purchases and other agricultural improvements. Farm\nproduct loans generally have a one-year term, and machinery, equipment and breeding livestock loans generally have five to seven\nyear terms. Extension of credit is based upon the borrower’s ability to repay, as well as the existence of federal guarantees\nand crop insurance coverage. These loans are generally secured by a blanket lien on livestock, equipment, feed, hay, grain and\ngrowing crops. Equipment and breeding livestock loans are generally limited to 75% of appraised value. The Bank continues to focus\non generating additional agriculture loan relationships in each of its market areas. Improvements in the financial results of\nthe Bank’s agriculture customers contributed to the decline in these loan balances as of December 31, 2020 compared to December\n31, 2019.",
        " ",
        "Consumer\nand Other Lending. Loans classified as consumer and other loans include automobile, boat, home improvement and home equity\nloans. With the exception of home improvement loans and home equity loans, the Bank generally takes a purchase money security\ninterest in collateral for which it provides the original financing. Home improvement loans and home equity loans are principally\nsecured through second mortgages. The terms of the loans typically range from one to five years, depending upon the use of the\nproceeds, and generally range from 75% to 90% of the value of the collateral. The majority of these loans are installment loans\nwith fixed interest rates. Home improvement and home equity loans are generally secured by a second mortgage on the borrower’s\npersonal residence and, when combined with the first mortgage, limited to 80% of the value of the property unless further protected\nby private mortgage insurance. Home improvement loans are generally made for terms of five to seven years with fixed interest\nrates. Home equity loans are generally made for terms of ten years on a revolving basis with adjustable monthly interest rates\ntied to the national prime interest rate. While the Bank primarily provides consumer loans to its existing customers, consumer\nlending is not a category the Bank targets for organic growth.",
        " ",
        " ",
        "Loan\nOrigination and Processing",
        " ",
        "Loan\noriginations are derived from a number of sources. Residential loan originations result from real estate broker referrals, direct\nsolicitation by the Bank’s loan officers, present depositors and borrowers, referrals from builders and attorneys, walk-in\ncustomers and, in some instances, other lenders. Consumer and commercial real estate loan originations generally emanate from\nmany of the same sources.",
        " ",
        "Residential\nloan applications are underwritten and closed based upon standards which generally meet secondary market guidelines. The loan\nunderwriting procedures followed by the Bank conform to regulatory specifications and are designed to assess both the borrower’s\nability to make principal and interest payments and the value of any assets or property serving as collateral for the loan. Generally,\nas part of the process, a loan officer meets with each applicant to obtain the appropriate employment and financial information\nas well as any other required loan information. The Bank then obtains reports with respect to the borrower’s credit record,\nand on real estate loans, orders and reviews an appraisal of any collateral for the loan (prepared for the Bank by an independent\nappraiser).",
        " ",
        "Loan\napplicants are notified promptly of the decision of the Bank. Prior to closing any long-term loan, the borrower must provide proof\nof fire and casualty insurance on the property serving as collateral, and such insurance must be maintained during the full term\nof the loan. Title insurance is required on loans collateralized by real property.",
        " ",
        "The\nBank is focusing on the generation of commercial, commercial real estate and agriculture loans to grow and diversify the loan\nportfolio. During 2020, the Bank was able to generate loan growth across the geographic markets that it serves, primarily in commercial\nreal estate and commercial loans. In addition, the Bank also generated significant loan growth by originating PPP loans to help\nbusinesses impacted by COVID-19."

The principal risks we face are market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal and reputational risks. We believe that we exercise sound practical judgment and undertake rigorous quantitative analysis before engaging in transactions to ensure that appropriate risk mitigators are in place. We mitigate risk by carefully considering the amount of capital allocated to each of our businesses, establishing trading limits, setting credit limits for individual counterparties and, to the extent that we make principal investments, committing capital to transactions in instances when we believe we have the advantage of industry- or company-specific expertise. Our focus is always on balancing risk and return, in that we attempt to achieve returns from each of our businesses that are commensurate with the risks we assume. Our participation in any underwritten securities offering is submitted for approval to a committee consisting of capital markets, investment banking, compliance and legal professionals. As part of our corporate credit and principal investment activities, we conduct due diligence before making any significant capital commitment, and all significant investments must be approved by our executive committee and/or board of directors. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of our approach to managing risks can never be completely assured. For example, unexpected large or rapid movements or disruptions in one or more markets or other unforeseen developments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The consequences of these developments can include losses due to adverse changes in our principal investments and marketable security values, decreases in the liquidity of trading positions, increases in our credit exposure to customers and counterparties, and increases in general systemic risk.",

In addition, the law required the Federal Reserve Board to raise the asset threshold under its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion for bank or savings and loan holding companies that are exempt from consolidated capital requirements, provided that such companies meet certain other conditions such as not engaging in significant nonbanking activities.   ",

Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions such as First Guaranty Bank, that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\"AOCI\"), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.",

Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one-to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.",

        "The Railway Labor Act, or RLA, governs our relations with labor organizations. Under the RLA, our collective bargaining agreements do not expire, but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, they must notify the other party in the manner agreed to by the parties. Under the RLA, after receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations. If no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board, or NMB, to appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no set timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation process. It is not unusual for those processes to last for many months, and even several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare at some time that an impasse exists. If an impasse is declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day “cooling off” period commences. During that period (or after), a Presidential Emergency Board, or PEB, may be established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another “cooling off” period of 30 days. At the end of a “cooling off” period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization and the airline each may resort to “self-help,” including, for the labor organization, a strike or other labor action, and for the airline, the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent “self-help” by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties.

Our compensation structure for junior bankers is based on a system of meritocracy whereby bankers are rewarded for top performance. Measuring performance enables us to recognize employee achievements and continue to identify and invest in areas of targeted development and professional growth.",
        "We recruit our junior bankers from the world’s leading undergraduate and graduate programs and have developed relationships with a variety of associations and diversity groups at universities where we recruit. Since our inception we have had a dedicated campus recruiting effort through which we have hired over 900 analysts and associates from these programs. We devote significant time and resources to training and mentoring our employees and have implemented generalist programs in which our junior professionals receive significant transaction experience across a wide range of products and industries. We believe this exposure enhances the investment banking experience and allows our junior professionals to develop and refine their proficiency in a broad variety of corporate finance matters at an early stage in their career. We are committed to talent retention and our goal is to develop our brightest and most ambitious junior professionals into successful Managing Directors. As of December 31, 2020, we had 903 employees globally, including 627 advisory professionals and 125 Managing Directors."

The following is a brief summary of certain statutes and rules and regulations that affect or may affect us.

Supervision, regulation, and examination of the Company by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund, rather than our shareholders.",
        "The Company.  The Company is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“the Act”), and is subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and actions, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe and unsound banking practices. As a bank holding company, the Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve an annual report and such other additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the Act. The Federal Reserve may also examine the Company and each of its subsidiaries. As a small bank holding company under the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, the Company is not subject to risk-based capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve, which are substantially identical to those applicable to the Bank, and which are described below.",
        "The Act requires approval of the Federal Reserve for, among other things, a bank holding company’s direct or indirect acquisition of control of more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares, or substantially all the assets, of any bank or the merger or consolidation by a bank holding company with another bank holding company. The Act also generally permits the acquisition by a bank holding company of control, or substantially all of the assets of, any bank located in a state other than the home state of the bank holding company, except where the bank has not been in existence for the minimum period of time required by state law; but if the bank is at least 5 years old, the Federal Reserve may approve the acquisition.",
        "With certain limited exceptions, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring control of any voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in any activity other than banking or managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing service for its authorized subsidiaries. A bank holding company may, however, engage in, or acquire an interest in a company that engages in, activities which the Federal Reserve has determined by order or regulation to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto. In making such a determination, the Federal Reserve is required to consider whether the performance of such activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency, which outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. Some of the activities that the Federal Reserve has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking include making or servicing loans, performing certain data processing services, acting as a fiduciary or investment or financial advisor, and making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare. The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries.",

The GLB Act enumerates certain activities that are deemed financial in nature, such as underwriting insurance or acting as an insurance principal, agent or broker, underwriting, dealing in or making markets in securities, and engaging in merchant banking under certain restrictions. It also authorizes the Federal Reserve to determine by regulation what other activities are financial in nature, or incidental or complementary thereto.

Any loans from the holding company to such subsidiary banks likely would be unsecured and subordinated to such bank’s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the Bank.

        "Banking is a business, which depends on interest rate differentials. In general, the difference between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and its other borrowings and the interest received by a bank on loans extended to its customers and on securities held in its investment portfolio constitutes the major portion of the Bank’s earnings. Thus, the earnings and growth of the Bank are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money through various means including open market dealings in United States government securities. The nature and timing of changes in such policies and their impact on the Bank cannot be predicted.",

Further, a bank holding company and any subsidiary bank are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with the extension of credit. A subsidiary bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any services, or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that: (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property or services from or to such bank other than a loan, discount, deposit or trust service; (ii) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property or service from or to the Company or any other subsidiary of the Company; or (iii) the customer not obtain some other credit, property or service from competitors, except for reasonable requirements to assure the soundness of credit extended.",

Interstate acquisitions of branches are permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Such interstate bank mergers and branch acquisitions are also subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration limitations described in the Riegle-Neal Act. Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia have each enacted laws, which permit interstate acquisitions of banks and bank branches. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes national and state banks to establish de novo branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch.",
        "The GLB Act made substantial changes in the historic restrictions on non-bank activities of bank holding companies, and allows affiliations between types of companies that were previously prohibited.

        "Brokered Deposits.  A “brokered deposit” is any deposit that is obtained from or through the mediation or assistance of a deposit broker. Deposit brokers may attract deposits from individuals and companies throughout the United States and internationally whose deposit decisions are based primarily on obtaining the highest interest rates. Certain reciprocal deposits of up to the lesser of $5 billion or 20% of an institution’s deposits are excluded from the definition of brokered deposits, where the institution is “well-capitalized” and has a composite rating of 1 or 2. We have used brokered deposits in the past, and we intend to continue to use brokered deposits as one of our funding sources to support future growth. There are risks associated with using brokered deposits. In order to continue to maintain our level of brokered deposits, we may be forced to pay higher interest rates than those contemplated by our asset-liability pricing strategy. In addition, banks that become less than “well-capitalized” under applicable regulatory capital requirements may be restricted in their ability to accept or renew, or prohibited from accepting or renewing, brokered deposits. If this funding source becomes more difficult to access, we will have to seek alternative funding sources in order to continue to fund our growth. This may include increasing our reliance on FHLB borrowings, attempting to attract additional non-brokered deposits, and selling loans. There can be no assurance that brokered deposits will be available, or if available, sufficient to support our continued growth. The unavailability of a sufficient volume of brokered deposits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The FDIC has proposed to adopt regulations that are intended to expand the ability of institutions to accept brokered deposits by, among other things, simplifying the process by which institutions and deposit brokers nay obtain exemptions from the restriction or conditions on the acceptance of brokered deposits.",

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, foreign nationals and others, which are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on a “U.S. person” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of a sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g. property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.",
        "Capital Adequacy.  The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted risk-based and leverage capital adequacy requirements, pursuant to which they assess the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising banks and bank holding companies and in analyzing bank regulatory applications. Risk-based capital requirements determine the adequacy of capital based on the risk inherent in various classes of assets and off-balance sheet items. The Dodd-Frank Act additionally requires capital requirements to be countercyclical so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction, consistent with safety and soundness.",
        "The federal banking agencies have adopted rules, referred to as the Basel III Rules, to implement the framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel III”). The Basel III framework, among other things, (i) introduced the concept of common equity tier one capital (“CET1”), (ii) required that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, (iii) expanded the scope of the adjustments to capital that may be made as compared to existing regulations, and (iv) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements.",
        "The Basel III Rules require institutions to maintain: (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%, plus a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5%, or 7.0%; (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, or 8.5%; (iii) a minimum ratio of Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, or 10.5%; and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average of the month-end ratios each month during a calendar quarter).",
        "Basel III also provides for a “countercyclical capital buffer,” generally to be imposed when federal banking agencies determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk. This buffer would be a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The current policy of the Federal Reserve is to maintain the countercyclical capital buffer at 0% in a normal risk environment.",
        "Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) may face constraints on their ability to pay dividends, effect equity repurchases, and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers, which constraints vary based on the amount of the shortfall.",
        "Under the Basel III Rules, mortgage-servicing assets and deferred tax assets are subject to certain restrictions on their inclusion as capital. Certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, mortgage-servicing assets, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock are each subject to an individual limit of 10% of CET1 and an aggregate limit of 15% of CET1. The amount of these items in excess of the 10% and 15% thresholds are deducted from CET1. Amounts of mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions that are not deducted due to the aforementioned 10% and 15% thresholds are assigned a 250% risk weight. Finally, the Basel III Rules increase the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and makes selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors.",

        "The Basel III Rules also include, as part of the definition of CET1, a requirement that banking institutions include the amount of additional other comprehensive income, or AOCI, which primarily consists of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, which are not required to be treated as other-than-temporary impairment, net of tax, in calculating regulatory capital, unless the institution makes a one-time opt-out election from this provision in connection with the filing of its first regulatory reports after applicability of the Basel III Rules to that institution. The Bank opted out of this requirement and, as such, does not include AOCI in its regulatory capital calculation.",
        "The Basel III Rules provide for the manner of calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWAs”), including the recognition of credit risk mitigation, such as the financial collateral and a range of eligible guarantors. They also include the risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans; and higher (greater than 100%) risk weighting for certain commercial real estate exposures that have higher credit risk profiles, including higher loan-to-value, or LTV, and equity components. In particular, loans categorized as “high-volatility commercial real estate,” or HVCRE, loans are required to be assigned a 150% risk weighting and require additional capital support. HVCRE loans are defined to include any credit facility that finances or has financed the acquisition, development or construction of real property, unless it finances: 1-4 family residential properties; certain community development investments; agricultural land used or usable for, and whose value is based on, agricultural use; or commercial real estate projects in which: (i) the LTV is less than the applicable maximum supervisory LTV ratio established by the bank regulatory agencies; (ii) the borrower has contributed cash or unencumbered readily marketable assets, or has paid development expenses out of pocket, equal to at least 15% of the appraised “as completed” value; (iii) the borrower contributes its 15% before the bank advances any funds; and (iv) the capital contributed by the borrower, and any funds internally generated by the project, is contractually required to remain in the project until the facility is converted to permanent financing, sold or paid in full. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”), expanded the exclusion from HVCRE loans to include credit facilities financing the acquisition or refinance of, or improvements to, existing income producing property, secured by the property, if the cash flow being generated by the property is sufficient to support the debt service and expenses of the property in accordance with the institution’s loan criteria for permanent financing. The EGRRCPA also provides that the value of contributed property will be its appraised value, rather than its cost. The EGRRCPA permits an institution to reclassify an HVCRE loan as a non-HVCRE loan upon substantial completion of the project, where the cash flow from the property is sufficient to support debt service and expenses, in accordance with the institution’s underwriting criteria for permanent financing.",
        "The EGRRCPA also directed the federal banking agencies to develop a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio,” (“CBLR”), calculated by dividing tangible equity capital by average consolidated total assets. In October 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a CBLR of 9%. If a “qualified community bank,” generally a depository institution or depository institution holding company with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, has a leverage ratio which exceeds the CBLR, then such institution is considered to have met all generally applicable leverage and risk based capital requirements; the capital ratio requirements for “well capitalized” status under Section 38 of the FDIA, and any other leverage or capital requirements to which it is subject. An institution or holding company may be excluded from qualifying community bank status based on its risk profile, including consideration of its off-balance sheet exposures; trading assets and liabilities; total notional derivatives exposures; and such other facts as the appropriate federal banking agencies determine to be appropriate. These CBLR rules were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021\" below. We adopted this simplified capital regime on January 1, 2020, but there can be no assurance that satisfaction of the CBLR will provide adequate capital for their operations and growth, or an adequate cushion against increased levels of nonperforming assets or weakened economic conditions.",
        "As discussed below, the Basel III Rules also integrate the new capital requirements into the prompt corrective action provisions under Section 38 of the FDIA.",
        "The capital ratios described above are the minimum levels that the federal banking agencies expect. Our state and federal regulators have the discretion to require us to maintain higher capital levels based upon our concentrations of loans, the risk of our lending or other activities, the performance of our loan and investment portfolios and other factors. Failure to maintain such higher capital expectations could result in a lower composite regulatory rating, which would impact our deposit insurance premiums and could affect our ability to borrow and costs of borrowing, and could result in additional or more severe enforcement actions. In respect of institutions with high concentrations of loans in areas deemed to be higher risk, or during periods of significant economic stress, regulators may require an institution to maintain a higher level of capital, and/or to maintain more stringent risk management measures, than those required by these regulations.",

        "In December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the last version of the Basel III accord, generally referred to as “Basel IV.” The Basel Committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of RWAs, which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk and operational risk, which will facilitate the comparability of banks’ capital ratios; constraining the use of internally modeled approaches; and complementing the risk-weighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor. Leadership of the federal banking agencies who are tasked with implementing Basel IV supported the revisions. Although it is uncertain at this time, it is anticipated that some, if not all, of the Basel IV accord may be incorporated into the capital requirements framework applicable to the Bank.",
        "In 2016, FASB issued the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) model, which will become applicable to us on January 1, 2023. CECL requires financial institutions to estimate and establish a provision for credit losses over the lifetime of the asset, at the origination or the date of acquisition of the asset, as opposed to reserving for incurred or probable losses through the balance sheet date. Upon implementation, an institution would recognize a one-time cumulative effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses. The Federal Reserve and FDIC have adopted a rule providing for an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects upon adopting the standard.",
        "Prompt Corrective Action.  Under Section 38 of the FDIA, each federal banking agency is required to implement a system of prompt corrective action for institutions that it regulates. The federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations for this purpose. The following capital requirements currently apply to the Bank for purposes of Section 38.",

The appropriate federal banking agency must provide the institution with written notice of approval or disapproval within 60 days after receiving a capital restoration plan, subject to extensions by the applicable agency.",
        "An institution that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution.

Such a guaranty shall expire after the appropriate federal banking agency notifies the institution that it has remained adequately capitalized for four consecutive calendar quarters. An institution that fails to submit a written capital restoration plan within the requisite period, including any required performance guaranty, or fails in any material respect to implement a capital restoration plan, shall be subject to the restrictions in Section 38 of the FDIA that are applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions.",

Unless the FDIC or other appropriate federal banking agency makes specific further findings and certifies that the institution is viable and is not expected to fail, an institution that remains critically undercapitalized during the fourth calendar quarter after the date it became critically undercapitalized must be placed in receivership. The general rule is that the FDIC will be appointed as receiver within 90 days after an institution becomes critically undercapitalized unless good cause is shown and an extension is agreed to by the federal regulators. In general, good cause requires that adequate capital has been raised and is imminently available for infusion into the institution, except for certain technical requirements, which may delay the infusion for a period of time beyond the 90 day time period.",

        "The rule implementing the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that lenders determine whether a consumer has the ability to repay a mortgage loan, established certain minimum requirements for creditors when making ability to pay determinations, and established certain protections from liability for mortgages meeting the definition of “qualified mortgages.” Generally, the rule applies to all consumer-purpose, closed-end loans secured by a dwelling including home-purchase loans, refinances and home equity loans – whether a first or subordinate lien. The rule does not cover, among other things, home equity lines of credit or other open-end credit; temporary or “bridge” loans with a term of 12 months or less, such as a loan to finance the initial construction of a dwelling; a construction phase of 12 months or less of a construction-to-permanent loan; and business-purpose loans, even if secured by a dwelling. The rule afforded greater legal protections for lenders making qualified mortgages that are not “higher priced.” Qualified mortgages must generally satisfy detailed requirements related to product features, underwriting standards, and a points and fees requirement whereby the total points and fees on a mortgage loan cannot exceed specified amounts or percentages of the total loan amount. Mandatory features of a qualified mortgage include: (1) a loan term not exceeding 30 years; and (2) regular periodic payments that do not result in negative amortization, deferral of principal repayment, or a balloon payment. Further, the rule clarified that qualified mortgages do not include “no-doc” loans and loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, or balloon payments. The rule created special categories of qualified mortgages originated by certain smaller creditors.

Institutions, which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital.",
        "FDIC Insurance Premiums.  The FDIC maintains a risk-based assessment system for determining deposit insurance premiums. The FDIC has established four risk categories, each subject to a different premium rate, ranging from a low of 2.5 basis points up to 45 basis points, based upon an institution’s status as well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized, and the institution’s supervisory rating. In general, an institution’s assessment base for calculating its deposit insurance premium is determined by subtracting its tangible equity and certain allowable deductions from its consolidated average assets. There are three adjustments that can be made to an institution’s initial base assessment rate: (1) a potential decrease for long-term unsecured debt, including senior and subordinated debt and, for small institutions, a portion of Tier 1 capital; (2) a potential increase for secured liabilities above a threshold amount; and (3) for institutions other than those with the lowest risk rating, a potential increase for brokered deposits above a threshold amount. Institutions with less than $10 billion in assets that have been FDIC-insured for at least five years, instead of the four risk categories, a financial ratios method based on a statistical model estimating the bank’s probability of failure over three years, utilizing seven financial ratios (leverage ratio; net income before taxes/total assets; nonperforming loans and leases/gross assets; other real estate owned/gross assets; brokered deposit ratio; one year asset growth; and loan mix index) and a weighted average of supervisory ratings components. The financial ratios method also provides that community banks with brokered deposits in excess of 10% of total consolidated assets (inclusive of reciprocal deposits if a bank is not well-capitalized or has a composite supervisory rating other than a 1 or 2) may be subject to an increased assessment rate if it has experienced rapid growth; lowers the range of authorized assessment rates to 1.5 basis points for institutions posing the least risk, increases the range up to 40 basis points for institutions posing the most risk; and further lowers the range of assessment rates if the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increases to 2% or more. Institutions with over $10 billion in total consolidated assets are required to pay a surcharge of 4.5 basis points on their assessment base, subject to certain adjustments. The FDIC may also impose special assessments from time to time. Under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, FDIC insured institutions with assets in excess of $10 billion are also subject to a phase out of the deductibility of deposit insurance premiums.",
        "The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250 thousand per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for calculating FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on a financial institution’s average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund to 1.35% of insured deposits and eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.",

        "Limitations on Incentive Compensation.  In April 2016, the Federal Reserve and other federal financial agencies re-proposed restrictions on incentive-based compensation pursuant to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act for financial institutions with $1 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For institutions with at least $1 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, the proposal would impose principles-based restrictions that are broadly consistent with existing interagency guidance on incentive-based compensation. Such institutions would be prohibited from entering into incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by the institution (i) by providing an executive officer, employee, director, principal shareholder or individuals who are “significant risk takers” with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or (ii) that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. The proposal would also impose certain governance and recordkeeping requirements on institutions of our size. The Federal Reserve would reserve the authority to impose more stringent requirements on institutions of our size. We are evaluating the expected impact of the proposal on our business.",
        "Cybersecurity.  In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. In December 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require banking organizations to notify their primary regulator within 36 hours of becoming aware of a \"computer-security incident\" or a \"notification incident.\" The proposed rule also would require specific and immediate notifications by bank service providers that become aware of similar incidents.",
        "To date, we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, but our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers.",
