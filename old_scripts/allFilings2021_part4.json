        "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") restricts the amounts of debit card fees that certain institutions can charge merchants. Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, debit interchange rates for card issuers with assets of $10 billion or more are capped at $0.21 per transaction and an ad valorem component of 5 basis points to reflect a portion of the issuer's fraud losses plus, for qualifying issuers, an additional $0.01 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs. ",
        "In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act limits the ability of payment card networks to impose certain restrictions because it allows merchants to: (i) set minimum dollar amounts (not to exceed $10) for the acceptance of a credit card (and allows federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education to set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards) and (ii) provide discounts or incentives to encourage consumers to pay with cash, checks, debit cards or credit cards.",
        "The rules also contain prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions that require a card issuer to enable at least two unaffiliated networks on each debit card, prohibit card networks from entering into exclusivity arrangements and restrict the ability of issuers or networks to mandate transaction routing requirements. The prohibition on network exclusivity has not significantly affected our ability to pass on network fees and other costs to our customers, nor do we expect it to in the future.",
        "The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\"), which has assumed responsibility for enforcing federal consumer protection laws, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which has the authority to determine whether any nonbank financial company, such as us, should be supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \"Federal Reserve\") on the ground that it is \"systemically important\" to the U.S. financial system.

        "Privacy, Information Security and Other Business Practices Regulation",
        "Aspects of our business are also subject, directly or indirectly, to business and trade practices regulation in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere. For example, in the United States, we and our financial institution customers are, respectively, subject to the Federal Trade Commission’s and the federal banking regulators’ privacy and information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These requirements limit the manner in which personal information may be collected, stored, used and disclosed. The Federal Trade Commission’s information safeguarding rules require us to develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate for our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. In many jurisdictions, including every U.S. State, consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach, and such notification requirements continue to increase in scope and cost. The changing privacy laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, including the adoption by the European Union of the General Data Protection Regulation, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective in January 2020, create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data. In addition, multiple states, Congress and regulators outside the United States are considering similar laws or regulations which could create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data. See \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" for additional discussion of the potential risks associated with future changes in laws or regulations.

While we have always had distributed teams collaborating around the globe, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an unexpected experiment in remote work, as the vast majority of our employees pivoted to working from home starting in March 2020. In May 2020, we announced that most employees will continue to have the option to work remotely even after we reopen our offices. This flexible location policy has unlocked opportunities to source, connect, and hire talent in more locations.

        "General. Atlas, Polar and Southern Air (the “Airlines”) are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) and the FAA, among other U.S. and foreign government agencies.  The DOT primarily regulates economic issues affecting air service, such as certification, fitness and citizenship, competitive practices, insurance and consumer protection.  The DOT has the authority to investigate and institute proceedings to enforce its economic regulations and may assess civil penalties, revoke operating authority or seek criminal sanctions.  The Airlines hold DOT-issued certificates of public convenience and necessity plus exemption authority to engage in scheduled air transportation of property and mail in domestic, as well as enumerated international markets, and charter air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis.  Atlas additionally holds worldwide passenger charter authority. ",
        "10",
        " ",
        "The DOT conducts periodic evaluations of each air carrier’s fitness and citizenship.  In the area of fitness, the DOT seeks to ensure that a carrier has the managerial competence, compliance disposition and financial resources needed to conduct the operations for which it has been certificated.  Additionally, each U.S. air carrier must remain a U.S. citizen by (i) being organized under the laws of the United States or a state, territory or possession thereof; (ii) requiring its president and at least two-thirds of its directors and other managing officers to be U.S. citizens; (iii) allowing no more than 25% of its voting stock to be owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by foreign nationals; and (iv) not being otherwise subject to foreign control.  The DOT broadly interprets “control” to exist when an individual or entity has the potential to exert substantial influence over airline decisions through affirmative action or the threatened withholding of consents or approvals.  We believe the DOT will continue to find the Airlines’ fitness and citizenship favorable.",
        "In addition, the Airlines are required to hold valid FAA-issued air carrier certificates and FAA-approved operations specifications authorizing operation in specific regions with specified equipment under specific conditions and are subject to extensive FAA regulation and oversight.  The FAA is the U.S. government agency primarily responsible for regulation of flight operations and, in particular, matters affecting air safety, such as airworthiness requirements for aircraft, operating procedures, mandatory equipment and the licensing of pilots, mechanics and dispatchers.  The FAA monitors compliance with maintenance, flight operations and safety regulations and performs frequent spot inspections of aircraft, employees and records.  The FAA also has the authority to issue ADs and maintenance directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other things, inspection of aircraft and engines, fire retardant and smoke detection devices, increased security precautions, collision and windshear avoidance systems, noise abatement and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts that have failed or may fail in the future.  In addition, the FAA mandates certain record-keeping procedures.  The FAA has the authority to modify, temporarily suspend or permanently revoke an air carrier’s authority to provide air transportation or that of its licensed personnel, after providing notice and a hearing, for failure to comply with FAA rules, regulations and directives.  The FAA is empowered to assess civil penalties for such failures or institute proceedings for the imposition and collection of monetary fines for the violation of certain FAA regulations and directives.  The FAA is also empowered to modify, suspend or revoke an air carrier’s authority on an emergency basis, without providing notice and a hearing, where significant safety issues are involved.   ",
        "International. Air transportation in international markets (the vast majority of markets in which the Airlines operate) is subject to extensive additional regulation.  The ability of the Airlines to operate in other countries is governed by aviation agreements between the United States and the respective countries (in the case of Europe, the European Union (the “EU”)) or, in the absence of such an agreement, by principles of reciprocity.  Sometimes, aviation agreements restrict the number of airlines that may operate, their frequency of operation, or the routes over which they may fly.  This makes it necessary for the DOT to award route and operating rights to U.S. air carrier applicants through competitive route proceedings.  International aviation agreements are periodically subject to renegotiation, and changes in U.S. or foreign governments could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of existing route authorities or otherwise affect the Airlines’ international operations.  Foreign government authorities also impose substantial licensing and business registration requirements and, in some cases, require the advance filing or approval of schedules or rates.  Moreover, the DOT and foreign government agencies typically regulate alliances and other commercial arrangements between U.S. and foreign air carriers, such as the ACMI and CMI arrangements that Atlas maintains.  Approval of these arrangements is not guaranteed and may be conditional.  In addition, approval during one time period does not guarantee approval in future periods. ",
        "A foreign government’s regulation of its own air carriers can also affect our business.  For instance, until recently, the EU placed temporal limits on the ability of EU carriers to use ACMI aircraft operated by airlines of non-EU member states.  The regulations had a negative impact on our ACMI business opportunities.  ",

At this time, these issues are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations.  In December 2018, the U.S. and U.K. governments reached agreement on the terms of an open skies agreement governing U.S. and U.K. airlines in anticipation of the U.K. leaving the EU.  This new agreement was signed on November 17, 2020 and became effective on January 1, 2021.  It allows new “7th Freedom” rights for all-cargo services and may result in new opportunities for us.  ",

        "Airport Access. The ability of the Airlines to operate suitable schedules is dependent on their ability to gain access to airports of their choice at commercially desirable times and on acceptable terms.  In some cases, access is constrained by the need for the assignment of takeoff and landing “slots” or comparable operational rights.  Like other air carriers, the Airlines are subject to such constraints at slot-restricted airports in cities such as Chicago and a variety of foreign locations (e.g., Amsterdam, Incheon, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo).  The availability of slots is not assured and the inability of the Airlines or their ACMI carrier customers to obtain additional slots could inhibit efforts to provide expanded services in certain international markets.  The reduction in global air traffic resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has alleviated near-term access concerns at most congested airports.  Airport access issues may increase as passenger aviation recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition, nighttime flight restrictions have been imposed or proposed by Hong Kong and various airports in Europe, Canada and the U.S.  These could have an adverse operational or economic impact.",
        "Access to the New York airspace had presented an additional challenge in recent years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Because of congestion in the New York area, especially at John F. Kennedy International Airport (“JFK”), the FAA imposes hourly limits on JFK operations of those carriers offering scheduled services and potentially could place limits on Charter flights once traffic levels reach their pre-pandemic levels.   ",
        "As a further means to address congestion, the FAA allows U.S. airports to raise landing fees to defray the costs of airfield facilities under construction or reconstruction.  It is unclear whether airports may raise landing fees to recoup losses from the reduction in global air traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Any landing fee increases implemented would have an impact on airlines generally.",
        "Security. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) and international regulatory bodies extensively regulate aviation security through rules, regulations and security directives that are designed to prevent unauthorized access to passenger and freighter aircraft and the introduction of prohibited items including firearms and explosives onto an aircraft.  Atlas and Polar currently operate pursuant to a TSA-approved risk-based security program that, we believe, adequately maintains the security of all aircraft in the fleet.  We utilize the TSA, the intelligence community and the private sector as resources for our aggressive global threat-based risk-management program.  There can be no assurance, however, that we will remain in compliance with existing or any additional security requirements imposed by TSA or by U.S. Congress without incurring substantial costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations.  To mitigate any such increase, we are working closely with the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies to ensure that a risk-based management approach is utilized to target specific “at-risk” cargo.  Additionally, foreign governments and regulatory bodies (such as the European Commission) impose their own aviation security requirements and have increasingly tightened such requirements.  This may have an adverse impact on our operations, especially to the extent the new requirements may necessitate redundant or costly measures or be in conflict with TSA requirements.  We have successfully implemented all European Commission security programs allowing us unimpeded access to European markets.",
        "Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including the discharge of pollution, the disposal of materials and chemical wastes, the cleanup of contamination and the regulation of aircraft noise, which are administered by numerous state, local, federal and foreign agencies.  For instance, the DOT and the FAA have authority under the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 and under the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 to monitor and regulate aircraft engine noise.  We believe that all aircraft in our fleet materially comply with current DOT, FAA and international noise standards. ",
        "We are also subject to the regulations in the U.S., by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and the international jurisdictions in which we operate regarding air quality.  We believe that all of our aircraft meet or exceed applicable fuel venting requirements and other air emissions standards.

        " ",
        "For instance, in October 2013, the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) reached a nonbinding agreement to address climate change by developing global market-based measures to assist in achieving carbon-neutral growth.  In October 2016, ICAO approved and subsequently amended a resolution to adopt a global market-based measure known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”), which is designed to offset any annual increases in total carbon emissions from international civil aviation above a baseline level determined by 2019 and 2020 emissions.  Although various details regarding the implementation of CORSIA still need to be finalized and have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, a pilot phase will run from 2021 to 2023.  Starting in 2019, the Airlines have voluntarily begun tracking and reporting emissions in accordance with the CORSIA methodology in 2020, even though it is not yet mandatory in ICAO member countries.  As a result, starting in 2024, the Airlines may need to purchase allowances to offset their share of emissions overages based on the reporting for the 2021 to 2023 compliance period.  For subsequent compliance periods, a similar procedure will apply.",
        "The EU continues to address climate change through its Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”). Following the end of every year, to the extent the ETS applies, each airline must tender the number of carbon emissions allowances (“Allowances”) corresponding to carbon emissions generated by its covered flight activity during the year.  If the airline’s flight activity during the year has produced carbon emissions exceeding the number of Allowances that it has been awarded, the airline must acquire Allowances from other airlines in the open market.  In recognition of ICAO’s adoption of CORSIA, the ETS has been suspended with respect to flights to and from non-European countries continues through December 31, 2023.  However, the ETS remains applicable to intra-European flights. Additionally, various European constituencies have begun to advocate for supplemental controls on aviation greenhouse gas emissions through additional taxation and similar measures. ",
        "In the U.S., various constituencies have continued to advocate for controls on greenhouse gas emissions.  On August 15, 2016, the EPA issued a final rule finding that greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare.  It is possible that these or other developments could lead to the future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft in the U.S. ",
        "Other Regulations. Air carriers are also subject to certain provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 because of their extensive use of radio and other communication facilities and are required to obtain an aeronautical radio license from the Federal Communications Commission.  Additionally, we are subject to U.S. and foreign antitrust requirements and international trade restrictions imposed by U.S. presidential determination and U.S. government agency regulation, including the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”).  We endeavor to comply with such requirements at all times.  We are also subject to state and local laws and regulations at locations where we operate and at airports that we serve.  Our operations may become subject to additional international, U.S. federal, state and local requirements in the future.  ",

        "Civil Reserve Air Fleet. As part of our Charter business, Atlas and Polar both participate in the U.S. Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”) Program, which permits the U.S. Department of Defense to utilize participants’ aircraft during national emergencies when the need for military airlift exceeds the capability of military aircraft.  Participation in the CRAF Program could adversely restrict our commercial business in times of national emergency. Under the CRAF Program, contracts with the AMC are for two-years with an option for the AMC to extend the contract for two additional two-year periods.  We have made a substantial number of our aircraft available for use by the U.S. military in support of their operations and we operate such flights pursuant to cost-based contracts.  Atlas bears all direct operating costs for both passenger and cargo aircraft, which include fuel, insurance, overfly, landing and ground handling expenses.  The contracted charter rates (per mile) and fuel prices (per gallon) are fixed by the AMC periodically.  We receive reimbursements from the AMC each month if the price of fuel paid by us to vendors for the AMC Charter flights exceeds the fixed price.  If the price of fuel paid by us is less than the fixed price, then we pay the difference to the AMC.",

        "Future Regulation.

The revenue increase was partially offset by a decline in Great Britain and International, due to a change in the remuneration model for certain lines of business. This change, which is neutral to operating income, results in lower revenue and an equal reduction to salaries and benefits expense. Absent this change, International revenue increased, led by growth in Latin America and Asia. Great Britain was additionally impacted by an internal transfer of a book of business to North America.

These “repack” stations have commenced operation on their new assigned channels and have ceased operating on their former channels. Congress has allocated up to an industry-wide total of $2.75 billion to reimburse television broadcasters, MVPDs and other parties for costs reasonably incurred due to the repack. This fund is not available to reimburse repacking costs for stations which are surrendering their spectrum and entering into channel sharing relationships. Broadcasters, MVPDs and other parties have submitted to the FCC estimates of their reimbursable costs, followed by subsequent requests for reimbursement of those costs. As of January 4, 2021, verified cost estimates were over $2.19 billion, with additional reimbursements still to be made to repack stations as well as certain low power television and FM radio stations affected by the repack. As of January 7, 2021, the FCC reported that all repack stations had ceased operating on their former channel assignments.

As more pilots in the industry approach mandatory retirement age, the U.S. airline industry may be affected by a pilot shortage. We may be required to increase wages and/or benefits in order to attract and retain qualified personnel or risk considerable crewmember turnover. In addition, we have had crewmembers take opt out packages to reduce our costs and we may continue to lose crewmembers due to the impact of COVID-19 on aviation and we may lose crewleaders as a result of restrictions imposed under the CARES Act. If we are unable to hire, train, and retain qualified crewmembers representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets, our business could be harmed and we may be unable to implement our growth plans.  In addition, our business may be harmed if we lose too many individuals with institutional knowledge.",

Our company culture is important to providing high quality customer service and having a productive workforce in order to help keep our costs low. As we experience turnover, we may be unable to identify, hire, or retain enough people who meet the above criteria, including those in management or other key positions. Our company culture could otherwise be adversely affected by our growing operations and broader geographic diversity.

Any of the different crafts or classes of our crewmembers could unionize at any time, which would require us to negotiate in good faith with the crewmember group’s certified representative concerning a collective bargaining agreement. In addition, we may be subject to disruptions by unions protesting the non-union status of our other crewmembers. Any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could harm our business.",
        "In general, unionization has increased costs in the airline industry. In 2014, our pilots voted to be represented by the Airlines Pilot Association, or ALPA and our first collective bargaining agreement was ratified by the pilots and became effective on August 1, 2018. In April 2018, JetBlue inflight crewmembers elected to be solely represented by the Transport Workers Union of America, or TWU. The NMB certified the TWU as the representative body for JetBlue inflight crewmembers. In November 2020, our inflight crewmembers voted to decline the ratification of a tentative collective bargaining agreement between JetBlue and TWU. We are currently working with TWU to determine next steps. If we are unable to reach agreement on the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, or if we were to experience widespread crewmember dissatisfaction, we could be subject to adverse actions.",

We continue to focus on hiring, training, and retaining our Team Members as we believe this is key to maintaining quality and consistency in each of our restaurants.",
        "Shift Supervisors complete an in-depth training curriculum that develops their ability to supervise all aspects of shift execution, including, but not limited to, food safety, food production, Team Member coaching, creating memorable moments of connection with our Guests, ensuring Guest satisfaction, and financial aspects of the business. The Shift Supervisor program is an important steppingstone for hourly Team Members who desire a career in restaurant management.",
        "New restaurant managers participate in our eight-week Management Foundations training program. This program hones each manager's skills, specifically in two areas: flawless shift execution and effective coaching of Team Members.",

        "Providing our restaurant teams the support and resources they need to be successful requires dedication, an of-service attitude, and the utmost professionalism on the part of our restaurant support center team. We ensure the restaurant support center Team Members have what they need to meet these demands by offering several avenues to enhance their professional development, including but not limited to, an in-house leadership library of over 400 titles, more than 40 remote learning development opportunities, one-on-one career coaching, and the opportunity to attend conferences in their field.",
        "Team Member Engagement",
        "We regularly collect feedback to better understand and improve Team Member experience and identify opportunities to strengthen our culture. We welcome open, candid feedback to ensure Team Members feel heard and engaged and to better support the values important to each of our Team Members. We accomplish this through a variety of programs and forums, including town halls, virtual open forums, Heart Checks, one-on-one coaching meetings, Discovery cards, Quality Circles, and Team Member Voice. Heart Checks are performed at the beginning of restaurant team monthly performance meetings and allow for restaurant Team Members to candidly share their thoughts and feelings about Red Robin with members of the restaurant's leadership team. During Discovery card sessions, a Team Member reviews a set of theme cards with statements such as, \"I feel valued at my company and my opinions matter\". The Team Member then interprets each card and places the cards in one of three columns, strengths, opportunities, and neutral, based on their opinion of each Discovery card statement. The session leader then asks the Team Member in a one-on-one setting to elaborate on why they placed each card in the respective columns. Quality Circles are informal meetings including Team Members from all levels of the Company led by a key leader who facilitates a discussion about current events and issues affecting the Company and our Team Members. Team Member Voice is an annual anonymous survey taken by every Team Member in the Company where they can respond to statements on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The statements included on the survey cover topics such as satisfaction with their supervisor, direction of the Company, intention to remain at Red Robin, and receiving the tools necessary to succeed in their position. Results are separated between restaurant support center Team Members and restaurant Team Members, and then results are shared with Team Members in a supervisor position. In addition to these structured programs and forums, we maintain an open-door policy at all levels of the Company. Our Company remains committed to offering Team Members numerous opportunities to have their voices heard because we believe our Team Members are our most valuable resource.",

When interest rates rise, the underlying mortgages tend to be prepaid at a slower rate than anticipated, causing the principal repayments to be extended.

These laws require that we file a registration statement with the Commissioner that discloses the identity, financial condition, capital structure and ownership of each entity within our corporate structure and any transactions among the members of our holding company system. In some instances, we must provide prior notice to the Commissioner for material transactions between our insurance company subsidiaries and other affiliates in our holding company system.  These holding company statutes also require, among other things, prior approval of the payment of extraordinary dividends or distributions and any acquisition of a domestic insurer and that we file an annual Enterprise Risk Management report with the Commissioner.",

        "Insurance Regulation Concerning Dividends.  We rely on dividends from the Insurance Subsidiaries for our cash requirements.  The insurance holding company law of Massachusetts requires notice to the Commissioner of any dividend to the shareholders of an insurance company.  The Insurance Subsidiaries may not make an \"extraordinary dividend\" until thirty days after the Commissioner has received notice of the intended dividend and has not objected in such time.  As historically administered by the Commissioner, this provision requires the prior approval by the Commissioner of an extraordinary dividend.  An extraordinary dividend is defined as any dividend or distribution that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the greater of 10.0% of the insurer's surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurer's net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. Under Massachusetts law, an insurer may pay cash dividends only from its unassigned funds, also known as its earned surplus, and the insurer's remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.  At December 31, 2020, the statutory surplus of Safety Insurance was $754,066 and its net income for 2020 was $121,446.  A maximum of $121,446 will be available during 2021 for such dividends without prior approval of the Commissioner.",

        "Acquisition of Control of a Massachusetts Domiciled Insurance Company.  Massachusetts law requires advance approval by the Commissioner of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled in Massachusetts.  That law presumes that control exists where any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10.0% or more of our outstanding voting stock.  Even persons who do not acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10.0% of the outstanding shares of our common stock may be deemed to have acquired control if the Commissioner determines that control exists in fact.  Any purchaser of shares of common stock representing 10.0% or more of the voting power of our capital stock will be presumed to have acquired control of the Insurance Subsidiaries unless, following application by that purchaser the Commissioner determines that the acquisition does not constitute a change of control or is otherwise not subject to regulatory review.

Subject to certain exceptions, assessments are made in the proportion that each member's net written premiums for the prior calendar year for all property and casualty lines bore to the corresponding net written premiums for Insolvency Fund members for the same period.  As a matter of Massachusetts law, insurance rates and premiums include amounts to recoup any amounts paid by insurers for the costs of the Insolvency Fund.  By statute, no insurer in Massachusetts may be assessed in any year an amount greater than two percent of that insurer's direct written premium for the calendar year prior to the assessment.  We account for allocations from the Insolvency Fund as underwriting expenses.  CAR also assesses its members as a result of insurer insolvencies.  Because CAR is not able to recover an insolvent company's share of the net CAR losses from the Insolvency Fund, CAR must increase each of its member's shares of the deficit in order to compensate for the insolvent carrier's inability to pay its deficit assessment.  It is anticipated that there will be future assessments from time to time relating to various insolvencies.",

The statistical phase consists of 13 key financial ratios based on year-end data that are generated annually from the database of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\").

Generally, an insurance company will become subject to regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges of four or more of the ratios.

The regulatory action level, as defined by the NAIC requires an insurer to submit a plan containing corrective actions and requires the Commissioner to perform an examination or other analysis and issue a corrective order if total adjusted capital falls below 150.0% of the risk-based capital amount. The authorized control level, as defined by the NAIC, authorizes the Commissioner to take whatever regulatory actions he or she considers necessary to protect the best interest of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer which may include the actions necessary to cause the insurer to be placed under regulatory control, i.e., rehabilitation or liquidation, if total adjusted capital falls below 100.0% of the risk-based capital amount.

Certain airports, including the major airports at Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose, California; Sydney, Australia; and Tokyo, Japan, have established airport restrictions to limit noise, including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of such operations.

Labor relations in the air transportation industry are generally regulated under the Railway Labor Act. We and other airlines certificated prior to October 24, 1978 are also subject to preferential hiring rights granted by the Airline Deregulation Act to certain airline employees who have been furloughed or terminated (other than for cause). The Federal Communications Commission issues licenses and regulates the use of all communications frequencies assigned to us and other airlines. There is increased focus on consumer protection both on the federal and state level. We cannot always accurately predict the cost of such requirements on our operations.",
        "Additional laws and regulations are proposed from time to time, which could significantly increase the cost of airline operations by imposing additional requirements or restrictions. U.S. law restricts the ownership of U.S. airlines to corporations where no more than 25% of the voting stock may be held by non-U.S. citizens and the airline must be under the actual control of U.S. citizens. The President and two thirds of the Board of Directors and other managing officers must also be U.S. citizens. Regulations also have been considered from time to time that would prohibit or restrict the ownership and/or transfer of airline routes or takeoff and landing slots and authorizations. Also, the award of international routes to U.S. carriers (and their retention) is regulated by treaties and related agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments, which are amended from time to time. We cannot predict what laws and regulations will be adopted or what changes to international air transportation treaties will be adopted, if any, or how we will be affected by those changes."

        "On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. The CARES Act is a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill that was intended to provide relief in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Several provisions within the CARES Act led to action from the bank regulatory agencies and there were also separate provisions within the legislation that directly impacts financial institutions. Section 4022 of the CARES Act allows, until the earlier of December 31, 2020, or the date the national emergency declared by the President terminates, borrowers with federally-backed one-to-four family mortgage loans experiencing a financial hardship due to COVID-19 to request forbearance, regardless of delinquency status, for up to 360 days. Section 4022 also prohibited servicers of federally-backed mortgage loans from initiating foreclosures during the 60-day period beginning March 18, 2020. Further, on December 21, 2020, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”) announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would extend their single-family moratorium on foreclosures and evictions through February 28, 2021.  The FHA also extended through February 28, 2021, the deadline for single family borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages to request an initial COVID-19 forbearance from their mortgage servicer to defer or reduce their mortgage payments for up to six months, which can be extended for an additional six months.  In addition, President Biden requested that the federal agencies discussed above continue to extend the moratorium on foreclosures on federally-guaranteed mortgages until at least March 31, 2021.  In addition, under Section 4023 of the CARES Act, until the earlier of December 31, 2020 and the date the national emergency declared by the President terminates, borrowers with federally-backed multi-family mortgage loans whose payments were current as of February 1, 2020, but who have since experienced financial hardship due to COVID-19, may request a forbearance for up to 90 days. Borrowers receiving such forbearance may not evict or charge late fees to tenants for its duration.  On December 23, 2020, the FHFA announced an extension of forbearance programs for qualifying multifamily properties through March 31, 2021.  These regulatory and legislative actions may be expanded, extended and amended as the pandemic and its economic impact continues and the new administration has recently announced extensions of the foreclosure moratorium through at least June 30, 2021.",
        "The bank regulatory agencies have ensured that adequate flexibility will be given to financial institutions who work with borrowers affected by COVID-19, and have indicated that they will not criticize institutions who do so in a safe and sound manner.  Further, the federal bank regulatory agencies have encouraged financial institutions to report accurate information to credit bureaus regarding relief provided to borrowers and have urged the importance of financial institutions to continue to assist those borrowers impacted by COVID-19.  On April 2, 2020, the bank regulatory agencies issued a joint policy statement to facilitate mortgage servicers’ ability to place consumers in short-term payment forbearance programs.  This policy statement was followed by a final rule, on June 23, 2020, that makes it easier for consumers to transition out of financial hardship caused by COVID-19.  The rule makes it clear that servicers do not violate Regulation X (which places restrictions and requirements upon lenders, mortgage brokers, or servicers of home loans related to consumers when they apply and receive mortgage loans) by offering certain COVID-19-related loss mitigation options based on an evaluation of limited application information collected from the borrower. Also, in an attempt to allow individuals and businesses to more quickly access real estate equity, on September 29, 2020, the bank regulatory agencies issued a rule that deferred appraisal and evaluation requirements after the closing of certain residential and commercial real estate transactions through December 31, 2020.  On January 20, 2021, upon the inauguration of President Biden, the incoming Administration issued an Executive Order extending the federal eviction moratorium issued through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which was recently extended by Congress through January 31, 2021, through March 31, 2021.  Separately, as part of the COVID-19 relief package proposed by the Administration, this eviction moratorium would be further extended through September 30, 2021 if adopted as proposed.

        "The Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), originally established under the CARES Act and extended under the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021, authorizes financial institutions to make federally-guaranteed loans to qualifying small businesses and non-profit organizations.  These loans carry an interest rate of 1% per annum and a maturity of 2 years for loans originated prior to June 5, 2020 and 5 years for loans originated on or after June 5th.  The PPP provides that such loans may be forgiven if the borrowers meet certain requirements with respect to maintaining employee headcount and payroll and the use of the loan proceeds after the loan is originated.  The initial phase of the PPP, after being extended multiple times by Congress, expired on August 8, 2020.  However, on January 11, 2021, the SBA reopened the PPP for First Draw PPP loans to small business and non-profit organizations that did not receive a loan through the initial PPP phase.  Further, on January 13, 2021, the SBA reopened the PPP for Second Draw loans to small businesses and non-profit organizations that did receive a loan through the initial PPP phase.

",
        "In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset.  Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk.  Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings.  Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital.  Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries.  Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital.  Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt.  Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for credit losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values.  Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.  In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.",
        "In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, federal regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.

Under the rule, non-advanced approaches banking organizations such as the Bank will apply a simpler regulatory capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets (“MSAs”); certain deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) arising from temporary differences; investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions other than those currently applied; and capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties (often referred to as minority interest) that is includable in regulatory capital. Specifically, the rule eliminates: (i) the capital rule’s 10 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction threshold that applies individually to MSAs, temporary difference DTAs, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock; (ii) the aggregate 15 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction threshold that subsequently applies on a collective basis across such items; (iii) the 10 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction threshold for non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions; and (iv) the deduction treatment for significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not in the form of common stock. The capital rule no longer has distinct treatments for significant and non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, but instead require that non-advanced approaches banking organizations deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any amount of MSAs, temporary difference DTAs, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that individually exceeds 25 percent of common equity tier 1 capital.

On December 10, 2013, five U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC, adopted regulations implementing the Volcker Rule.  Those regulations prohibit banking entities from (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (2) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds, which are referred to as “covered funds.” The regulations also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule.  Historically, this meant that reporting requirements were tied to a bank’s total assets, where banks with assets at or below $10 billion had less stringent reporting requirements and banks with more than $10 billion had increasingly more stringent requirements as the size of the bank increased.",
        "However, in November 2019, five federal banking agencies issued a final rule revising certain aspects of the Volcker Rule.  The final rule simplifies and streamlines compliance requirements for firms that do not have significant trading activities and enhances requirements for firms that do.  Under the new rule, compliance requirements are based on the amount of assets and liabilities that a bank trades.  Firms with significant trading activities (i.e., those with $20 billion or more in trading assets and liabilities), have heightened compliance obligations.  The new rule became effective on January 1, 2020, but banking entities were not be required to comply with the new rules until January 1, 2021.",
        " Further, on June 25, 2020, the five U.S. financial regulators issued a final rule that modifies the rule's prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring “covered funds.”  The new rule (1) streamlines the covered funds portion of the rule; (2) addresses the extraterritorial treatment of certain foreign funds; and (3) permits banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other activities that do not raise concerns that the Volcker rule was intended to address. Although we will benefit from significantly reduced compliance obligations due to the level of our trading assets being below the $20 billion threshold, we will remain subject to the modified rules and requirements related to covered funds. Accordingly, we expect that the revised rule will reduce some of our compliance costs, but in the short term we may experience some costs in developing and implementing changes in conformance with the new rule.",

Under the CECL model, we are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans and leases held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected.  The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast that affect the collectability of the reported amount.  On December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies approved a final rule modifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an option to phase in over a period of three years the day-one regulatory capital effects of the CECL model.  The final rule also revises the agencies’ other rules to reflect the update to the accounting standards. The final rule took effect April 1, 2019.",

Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be recorded with previously applicable GAAP.  The Company recorded a $7.9 million increase to the allowance for credit losses and a $3.2 million liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures, which resulted in an $8.3 million cumulative effect adjustment decrease, net of tax, to retained earnings.  With regard to regulatory capital, the Company has elected to utilize the five-year CECL transition, which gives the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay.",

However, as described below, there have been changes to both the FDIC’s assessment range and its risk-based assessment procedures.",
        "The FDIC established a long range target size for the DIF of 2% of insured deposits.  The FDIC’s regulations also provided for a lower assessment rate schedule when the DIF reached 1.15% of total insured deposits.  The 1.15% ratio was achieved as of June 30, 2016.  As a result, effective July 1, 2016, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was lowered to 1.5 to 30 basis points for banks of less than $10 billion in consolidated assets.  The Dodd-Frank Act required banks with greater than $10 billion in assets to pay to increase the DIF reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%.  Consequently, also effective July 1, 2016, banks of greater than $10 billion assets paid a surcharge of 4.5 basis points on assets above $10 billion.  In November 2018, the FDIC indicated that the 1.35% ratio had been achieved, that surcharges on banks with more than $10 billion in assets would cease and that institutions below that size would receive credits for the portion of their assessment that contributed to the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%, effective when the ratio reaches 1.38%.  Also on July 1, 2016, the FDIC eliminated the risk categories.  The FDIC indicated that those credits were completely remitted as of September 30, 2020.",
        "Most institutions are now assessed based on financial ratios derived from statistical models that estimate the probability of a bank’s failure within three years.  Banks of greater than $10 billion are assessed based on a rate derived from a scorecard which assesses certain factors such as examination ratings and financial measures related to the bank’s ability to withstand stress and measures of loss severity to the DIF if the bank should fail.  When the Bank exceeds $10 billion in assets for four consecutive calendar quarters, which will occur in the first quarter of 2021, it will be classified as a large institution for deposit insurance assessment purposes, which is likely to result in a higher FDIC insurance premium.

Specifically, the rule (1) clarifies which activities qualify for CRA credit and (2) requires banks to identify an additional assessment area based on where they receive a significant portion of their domestic retail deposits, thus creating two assessment areas: a deposit-based assessment area and a facility-based assessment area. Members of Congress and community groups have expressed hostility to the new rule, and have raised the possibility of repealing it through legislative action.

        "  Bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing attention on consumer protection laws and regulations.  To promote fairness and transparency for mortgages, credit cards, and other consumer financial products and services, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB.  This agency is responsible for interpreting and enforcing federal consumer financial laws, as defined by the Dodd-Frank Act, that, among other things, govern the provision of deposit accounts along with mortgage origination and servicing.  Some federal consumer financial laws enforced by the CFPB include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, TILA, the Truth in Savings Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\"RESPA\"), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  The CFPB is also authorized to prevent any institution under its authority from engaging in an unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice in connection with consumer financial products and services.  As a residential mortgage lender, the Company and its bank subsidiaries are subject to multiple federal consumer protection statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, TILA, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, RESPA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Act and the Flood Disaster Protection Act.  Failure to comply with these and similar statutes and regulations can result in the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries becoming subject to formal or informal enforcement actions, the imposition of civil money penalties and consumer litigation. ",
        "Under TILA, as implemented by Regulation Z, mortgage lenders are required to make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms.  Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate “qualified mortgages,” which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a qualified mortgage (“QM”) is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a QM the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. ",
        "The CFPB has exclusive examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations by institutions under its supervision and is authorized, individually or jointly with the federal bank regulatory agencies, to conduct investigations to determine whether any person is, or has, engaged in conduct that violates such laws or regulations.  The CFPB may bring an administrative enforcement proceeding or civil action in Federal district court.  In addition, in accordance with a memorandum of understanding entered into between the CFPB and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the two agencies have agreed to coordinate efforts related to enforcing the fair lending laws, which includes information sharing and conducting joint investigations.  Now that the Company has exceeded $10 billion in assets in 2020, it is subject to the supervisory and enforcement authority of the CFPB.   ",
        "The Dodd-Frank Act also permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the CFPB.  As a result of these aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bank is operating in a stringent consumer compliance environment and is incurring additional costs related to consumer protection compliance, including but not limited to potential costs associated with CFPB examinations, regulatory and enforcement actions and consumer-oriented litigation, which is likely to increase as a result of the consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The CFPB, other financial regulatory agencies, as well as the Department of Justice have recently pursued a number of enforcement actions against depository institutions with respect to compliance with fair lending laws.

Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider’s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to loans by the Bank.  All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders’ related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.  With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer’s children and certain loans secured by the officer’s residence may not exceed at any one time the higher of 2.5% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000, but in no event more than $100,000.  Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider’s related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000; or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus.",
        "Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for, comparable transactions with other persons, and not involve more than the normal risk of payment or present other unfavorable features.  An exception may be made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.",

The first $16.9 million of otherwise reservable balances were exempted from the reserve requirements.  The Bank was in compliance with these requirements.  Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero.  That step was taken due to a change in the FRB’s approach to monetary policy.  The Federal Reserve indicated that it has no plans to reimpose reserve requirements, but could do so if conditions warrant.

Historically, the Company had been exempt from the interchange fee cap under the “small issuer” exemption, which applies to any debit card issuer with total worldwide assets (including those of its affiliates) of less than $10 billion as of the end of the previous calendar year.  Pursuant to FRB regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, interchange fees on debit card transactions are limited to a maximum of $0.21 per transaction plus 5 basis points of the transaction amount.

Federal Reserve Board policies generally provide that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention in the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.  Federal Reserve Board guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with Federal Reserve Board staff in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the Federal Reserve Board and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if: (i) net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.  Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.

ASC740 requires the tax effects of changes in tax law or rates to be recorded in the period of enactment.  The Corporation has evaluated such provisions and determined that the impact of the CARES Act of 2020 on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets as of 12/31/2020 was not material.",

        "Bad Debt Reserves. ",
        "Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve.  These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at taxable income.  The Bank was required to use the direct charge-off method to compute its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal income tax return. Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve).",
        "Taxable Distributions and Recapture.",
        " Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income should the Bank fail to meet certain asset and definitional tests.  Federal legislation has eliminated these recapture rules.  Retained earnings at December 31, 2020 included approximately $51.8 million for which no provisions for income tax had been made.  This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only.  Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes, distributions in complete or partial liquidation, stock redemptions and excess distributions to shareholders.  At December 31, 2020, the Bank had an unrecognized tax liability of $13.4 million with respect to this reserve.",
        "Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax.",
        " The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), imposed an alternative minimum tax (AMT) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (alternative minimum taxable income or AMTI). The AMT was payable to the extent such AMTI was in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeded the regular income tax.  Net operating losses could offset no more than 90% of AMTI.  Certain payments of alternative minimum tax could be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years.  The Company was not subject to the alternative minimum tax and has no such amounts available as credits for carryover.  The Tax Act repealed the corporate AMT effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.",
        "Net Operating Loss Carryovers.",
        " Under the general rule, for tax periods ending December 31, 2017 and prior a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.  At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.7 million of Federal Net Operating Losses (\"NOLs\").  These NOLs were generated by entities the Company acquired in previous years and are subject to an annual Code Section 382 limitation.  The Tax Act limits the NOL deduction for a given year to 80% of taxable income, effective with respect to losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.  It also repealed the pre-enactment carryback provision for NOLs and provides for the indefinite carryforward of NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017.",

        "New York State Taxation. ",
        " In 2014, New York State enacted significant and comprehensive reforms to its corporate tax system that went into effect January 1, 2015.  The legislation resulted in significant changes to the method of calculating income taxes for banks, including changes to future period tax rates, rules relating to the sourcing of income, and the elimination of the banking corporation tax so that banking corporations are taxed under New York State’s corporate franchise tax.  The corporate franchise tax is based on the combined entire net income of the Company and its affiliates allocable and apportionable to New York State and taxed at a rate of 6.5%.  The amount of revenues that are sourced to New York State under the new legislation can be expected to fluctuate over time.  In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“MTA”) Surcharge allocable to business activities carried on in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District.  The MTA surcharge for 2020 is 29.4% of a recomputed New York State franchise tax, calculated using a 6.5% tax rate on allocated and apportioned net income.  The examination of the Company's 2016 and 2015 New York State tax returns was completed in the first quarter of 2019, and did not have a material impact on the Company's effective income tax rate.  The Company's 2017 and 2018 New York State returns are currently under audit.   "

Employees are further encouraged to perform at their personal best through an ongoing scorecard measuring system that is tied directly to a pay for performance compensation program. We believe our sustainable process to hire, train and develop our people enables us to deliver a positive customer experience. A typical Potbelly shop consists of one manager, and as many as 5 to 14 employees during our peak hours.",

We believe this allows them to get to know their customers, understand the unique character of each neighborhood and form deep roots within the community. The shop manager has primary responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the shop and is required to abide by Potbelly’s operating standards. Our Management Training Program provides new managers with six to eight weeks of training that emphasizes culture, standards, strategy and procedures to prepare them for success, and is followed by on-going, in-shop coaching with their District or Regional manager. Our shop managers report to District Managers who typically report to a Regional Director, and ultimately to our Chief Operations Officer. In addition, members of senior management visit shops regularly to help ensure that our culture, strategy and quality standards are being adhered to in all aspects of our operations.",

The training period for new non-management employees lasts approximately eight weeks and is characterized by on-the-job supervision by an experienced employee. Ongoing employee training remains the responsibility of the shop manager, but, as noted above, we provide specific training for our employees around The Potbelly Advantage each year. Special emphasis is placed on the safety, consistency and quality of food preparation and service, which is monitored through ongoing coaching sessions and meetings with managers. In addition, we have other continuing communications with all of our employees on food safety and preparation standards.",
        "At Potbelly, we believe rewards and recognition play an important role in retaining our employees. Our approach to reward talent is through a combination of competitive compensation and benefits. To foster a sense of ownership and align the interest of our team members with shareholders, stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based units are provided to eligible team members under our 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Additionally, certain employees are eligible for performance-based cash incentive plans. These incentive plans reward individuals based on the achievement of predetermined company targets. ",

APUS regularly reviews the performance of its faculty by, among other things, monitoring the online contact that faculty have with students, reviewing student feedback, and evaluating the learning outcomes achieved by students. If APUS determines that a faculty member is not performing at an acceptable level, it works with the faculty member to improve performance by assigning the faculty member a mentor, providing additional training and/or coaching the faculty member for success. If the faculty member’s performance does not improve, APUS will no longer employ that faculty member to teach. APUS does not offer tenure to faculty members.",

To foster this development, the Company has created two early talent identification programs, a college internship program and Commercial Banking Development Program, each of which enhance management’s ability to hire outstanding people. Campus recruitment initiatives and partnerships also fuel the Company’s pipeline of talent. Within the internship program, college students and recent graduates are paired with leaders across the Company to create a valuable, immersive experience, with an objective of retaining the most promising interns and eventually bringing this talent into the Bank through the CBDP or other appropriate positions. The CBDP is an 18-month, on-the-job development program to train successful credit analysts that offers progressive assignments, mentoring, opportunities to learn the business and various aspects of leadership, with the objective of growing these individuals into future leaders of the Company. Additionally, the Company is expanding its sales training and mentoring efforts to foster internal development within its commercial lending teams.",

The Company has made a commitment to growing the share of its employee population from diverse communities and has experienced some success in recent years, although the Company believes there is still an opportunity for additional advancement in this area. For example, through focused recruiting efforts, the Company was able to increase the share of 2020 hires who are Black or African American to 7.6%, higher than the Company's current Black or African American employee population of  5.8%.",

Similarly, Millennials and women represent 31% and 57% of the Company's employee population, respectively, and account for 31% and 51% of the turnover, respectively.

In certain cases, such laws, directives and regulations may impose strict liability for pollution of the environment and contamination resulting from spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or waste.  Costs, damages and/or fines may result from the presence, investigation and remediation of such contamination at properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us or at off-site locations, including where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or waste.

For example, we have environmental policies governing both of our manufacturing facilities in Athlone, Ireland and Villa Guardia (Como), Italy, which demonstrate our commitment to environmental sustainability and require us to minimize resource use (e.g., energy and water) and waste generation, optimize the use of raw materials, and undertake continuous improvement in environmental performance, with an emphasis on pollution prevention."

Since this expansion, the CHR Committee has strategically conducted reviews of talent management and acquisition, succession planning, associate conduct, associate learning and development, diversity equity and inclusion, and associate retention. Notably, in 2019, the CHR Committee further strengthened its oversight of these areas through the implementation of a HCM Dashboard that it reviews periodically throughout the year.

As of December 31, 2020, Regions and its subsidiaries had 19,406 full-time equivalent employees supporting our consumer and commercial banking, wealth management, and mortgage product and services primarily across the Southeast and Midwest.  ",
        "Our associate team reflects the diversity of the communities we serve.  Approximately 64 percent of our associates are women and approximately 34 percent have self-identified as a part of a minority demographic. Because diversity equity and inclusion are fundamental to our human capital strategy, we believe it is important for our stakeholders to understand our progress, and therefore, we plan to provide additional transparency into our workforce demographics later this year after we file our 2019 and 2020 EEO-1 report to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. ",
        "A strong and impactful human capital programs begins at the top.  Our Board of Directors oversees our corporate strategy and sets the tone for our culture, values and high ethical standards, and through its Committees, holds management accountable for results. Beginning in 2018, the Board expanded the scope of our CHR Committee beyond its traditional compensation focused role to include oversight of all human capital management efforts within Regions. Since this expansion, the CHR Committee has strategically conducted reviews of talent management and acquisition, succession planning, associate conduct, associate learning and development, diversity equity and inclusion, and associate retention. Notably, in 2019, the CHR Committee further strengthened its oversight of these areas through the implementation of a HCM Dashboard that it reviews periodically throughout the year. The HCM Dashboard includes a mixture of trending and point-in-time metrics designed to provide information and analysis of workforce demographics; talent acquisition; workforce stability (retention, turnover, etc.); associate engagement; learning and development; and total rewards and associate support program utilization and effectiveness.",
        "In order to build the best team, it is necessary for us to fill talent needs with qualified, diverse and engaged associates. Key to our success is our internal talent management program which strives to optimally deploy existing talent across Regions by focusing on where our associates excel and helping them find the best roles for them. One of the hallmarks of our success in this area is demonstrated by our ability to fill vacancies from within. For example, in 2020, 45 percent of our hires were internal fills. For those roles which we fill externally, we continually build talent pipelines with an eye towards not only current needs, but also future demands of our business. Regions uses a number of innovative tools and structured processes to achieve our goals including applications and resources designed to reach larger and more diverse audiences. Our recruiting technology is agile, user friendly and allows us to offer to candidates a robust understanding of our needs, requirements and a view of our culture to support the building of a diverse, engaged workforce.",

        "Diversity equity and inclusion are fundamental to our corporate strategy. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion as noted starts at the top of our organization, with oversight of our initiatives provided by the CHR Committee. Led by our executive level Chief DE&I Officer, this commitment is implemented by a dedicated DE&I team, reinforced by senior leaders, and supported by our outstanding management team and associates. We track our progress in this area and continually implement programs and practices to support managers in reaching our goals.",
        "We also consider it critical to our success to invest in the professional development of all of our associates. We emphasize our commitment to professional development through opportunities such as technical, skills-based, management, and leadership training programs; formal talent and performance management processes; and sustainable career paths. We also aim to prepare our workforce for a rapidly changing environment and understand that reskilling and upskilling are crucial to staying competitive, meeting the needs of the modern workforce, and retaining associates. We’ve established a customized learning experience platform that provides the tools to measure, build, and communicate skills inside the Company. This tool provides the ability to inventory the skills our associates have, allowing us to target our development efforts on specific areas where elevated skills are needed. Regions also offers a leader and manager development program created to help people managers understand how to evaluate performance by leveraging the power of a strengths-based and engagement-focused workforce and culture.",
        "Understanding that automation, cognitive technologies, and the open talent economy are reshaping the future of work, Regions makes available to technology associates courses on-demand that offer intensive learning in application development, information technology operations, security, and technology architecture. This solution also offers professional development for data and business professionals. In addition, almost all associates may access a full suite of courses regardless of whether the application is needed in their current role.",
        "We offer competitive and fair compensation to our associates. Base salaries are established considering market competitive rates for specific roles; additionally, on an individual basis base salaries reflect the experience and performance levels of our associates. We assess the competitiveness of our ranges on an annual basis by benchmarking our rates against those paid by our peers. We established a minimum starting rate for our entry level positions at $15 an hour and we continue to study and review that level to ensure appropriateness. In addition to base salaries, we promote a robust pay for performance philosophy and incentivize a large majority of our associate population with incentive compensation designed to drive strategies, behaviors and business goals within our unique lines of business. Long-term stock-based incentive compensation is also key to the attraction and retention of key talent and is offered thoughtfully to our executive and leadership ranks. We believe tying the interests of our leaders to those of our shareholders creates a strong link to company performance.",
        "As the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our associates, we offer a competitive and comprehensive benefits program to support associates throughout all life stages. Our benefits include comprehensive health, life, and disability coverage that are funded in whole or in part by the Company as well as a 401(k) plan with a dollar for dollar company match on employee contributions up to 5 percent of pay and a base contribution of 2 percent of pay for all associates who do not participate in our grandfathered pension program. We also offer to our associates programs and tools to support their total well-being including a range of flexible work arrangements, generous time-off policies, physical, mental, and financial wellness benefits as well as other programs and practices that support associates and their families throughout the full spectrum of their careers and lives.",
        "Finally, in any review of 2020 human capital programs, it is imperative to note responsive changes we made in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2020 we implemented changes and enhancements that we determined were in the best interests of our associates, our customers and the communities we serve. For example, in an effort to promote associate well-being, we quickly moved approximately half of our associates to fully remote work arrangements during the pandemic. For those associates whose positions required on site service (such as branch, contact center and other operationally essential positions), we provided additional compensation during the original transition period to aid with unexpected and unusual conditions faced by these individual as we responded to the in-person service needs of our customers and communities. In addition, we implemented many other measures to help ensure and support associate safety. These measures included providing COVID-19 testing and relevant treatment at no cost to associates, expanding access to and payment for telehealth benefits and offering enhanced leave of absence benefits for those dealing with the virus or quarantine requirements. In all of our locations, we reduced occupancy levels to provide for social distancing, implemented stringent cleaning protocols, and have provided appropriate facemasks and other sanitizing supplies to protect associates, customers, and our communities.",

        "Regulation ",
        "The FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements that affect our operations and pending proceedings regarding additional or modified requirements that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly. ",
        "Except for operations in certain unlicensed frequency bands, wireless communications services providers generally must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10-15 years depending on the particular licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such noncompliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. ",
        "Additionally, Congress’s and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS and other wireless services, could significantly increase and intensify competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses or our competitive position in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers. ",
        "Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership through an entity controlling the licensee. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest, but must be reviewed and approved. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our Company by DT.",
        "For our Educational Broadband Service (“EBS”) licenses in the 2.5 GHz band, FCC rules previously limited eligibility to hold EBS licenses to accredited educational institutions and certain governmental, religious and nonprofit entities, while permitting those license holders to lease up to 95% of their capacity for non-educational purposes. Therefore, we primarily access EBS spectrum through long-term leasing arrangements with EBS license holders. Our EBS spectrum leases typically have an initial ",
        "9",
        "Table of Contents",
        "term equal to the remaining term of the EBS license, with an option to renew the lease for additional terms, for a total lease term of up to 30 years. On April 27, 2020, the FCC lifted the restriction on who can hold EBS licenses and the 30-year limitation on lease duration, among other changes. T-Mobile has started to acquire some of these EBS licenses but we continue to lease most of our spectrum in this band and expect that to be the case for some time. The elimination of these restrictions will allow and may encourage current license holders to sell their licenses to other parties, including to T-Mobile. While a majority of our leases have contractual provisions enabling us to match offers, we may be forced to compete with others to purchase 2.5 GHz licenses on the secondary market and expend additional capital earlier than we may have anticipated.",
        "While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communications services providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, zoning and land use. Notwithstanding this federal preemption, in response to the Pandemic, several state legislatures are considering bills that could potentially set prices, minimum performance standards, and/or restrictions on service discontinuation that could impact our business in those states.",
        "In addition, following the FCC’s adoption of the 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom (“RIF”) Order reclassifying broadband internet access services as Title I (non-common carrier services), a number of states have sought to impose state-specific net neutrality and privacy requirements on providers’ broadband services. The FCC’s RIF Order preempted such state efforts, which are inconsistent with the FCC’s federal deregulatory approach. Recently, however, the DC Circuit issued a ruling largely upholding the RIF Order, but also vacating the portion of the ruling broadly preempting state/local net neutrality laws. The court left open the prospect that particular state laws could still unlawfully conflict with the FCC net neutrality rules and be preempted; court challenges to some state enactments are pending. ",
        "While most states are largely seeking to codify the repealed federal rules, there are differences in some states, notably California, which has passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation. There are also efforts within Congress to pass federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirements, while also ensuring the preemption of separate state requirements, including the California laws. If not preempted or rescinded, separate state requirements will impose significant business costs and could also result in increased litigation costs and enforcement risks. State authority over wireless broadband services will remain unsettled until final action by the courts or Congress.",
        "In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown, and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.

Qualified professionals are in great demand, and we face significant competition for both senior and junior professionals with the requisite credentials and experience. Our principal competition for talent comes from other consulting firms and accounting firms, as well as from organizations seeking to staff their internal professional positions. Many of these competitors may be able to offer greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices, career paths, or geographic locations than we do. Therefore, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the skilled consultants we require to conduct and expand our operations successfully.

The DEI Council is led by employees spanning various management levels and global regions with program support from our executive management team. Additionally, our Chief Executive Officer A. William Stein has signed the CEO Action Pledge for Diversity & Inclusion, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Mr. Stein is Co-Chair of Nareit’s Dividends through Diversity, Equity & Inclusion CEO Council, seeking to advance diversity and inclusion throughout our industry.

We require social distancing in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and local health agency guidelines, have made modifications to our facilities, including posting signage detailing health and safety protocols, engage in regular sanitation, and require all visitors and employees to wear facial coverings. We have also modified staffing levels to avoid potential cross contamination among teams, and have instituted customer, employee and visitor screening. Together with our operations teams, we have implemented innovative approaches to maintain our high standards of customer service, including virtual data center tours to ensure that activities typically accomplished on-site or in-person continued throughout periods of reduced travel. Our non-essential and corporate personnel adopted a work-from-home approach beginning in March 2020, which has continued past the end of the year without significant impacts to productivity. We expect our corporate offices to remain largely closed through at least mid-year 2021. Refer to the discussion in Item 7.

Our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that, over the long run, will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the level and value of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets will likely result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets and a change in the discount rate or mortality assumptions, which will likely result in an increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations. The combined impact of these changes will affect the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years. In recent years, an extended duration strategy in the asset portfolio has been implemented in some plans to reduce the influence of liability volatility due to changes in interest rates.

In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation.

        "Globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth’s climate. At the Durban negotiations of the Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in 2012, a limited group of nations, including the European Union (the “EU”), agreed to a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in GHG emissions. More significantly, the EU GHG Emissions Trading System (“ETS”), established pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol to reduce GHG emissions in the EU, continues in its fourth phase. The EU parliament has used a process to formalize “backloading”—the withholding of GHG allowances during the trading period from 2014 to 2016 with additional allowances auctioned during 2019 to 2020—to prop up carbon prices. As backloading is only a temporary measure, a sustainable solution to the imbalance between supply and demand requires structural changes to the ETS. To that end, the European Commission established a market stability reserve to address the current surplus of allowances and improve the system’s resilience that started operating in 2019. In addition, the EU has set a binding target to reduce domestic GHG emissions by at least 40% below the 1990 level by 2030 and a binding target to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 32% of the EU’s energy consumption by 2030. The European Commission proposed to increase the greenhouse gas emission reduction target to at least 55% in September 2020, and expects to complete the associated legislative proposals by June 2021.",
        " ",
        "In addition, at the 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, the U.S. and nearly 200 other nations entered into an international climate agreement, which went into effect in November 2016 (the “Paris Agreement”). Although the agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and the U.S. completed the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. In response to the U.S.’s withdrawal announcement, various corporations, investors, and U.S. state and local governments publicly pledged to further the goals of the Paris Agreement. On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued written notification to the United Nations of the U.S.’s intention to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which will become effective in 30 days.",

To the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the EPA’s GHG regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs associated with new or expanded facilities. Significant expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the Clean Air Act’s (the “CAA”) requirements for pollutants regulated under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs. Some of our facilities are also subject to the EPA’s Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule, and any further regulation may increase our operational costs.",

Although these sites are subject to existing GHG legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs, although it is possible that GHG emission restrictions may increase over time. Potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet GHG emission restrictions and/or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. Currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites.",

Looking beyond our people, we also recognized the needs of the communities where we live and work, increasing the level of charitable contributions to assist food banks, families at risk, and organizations with a focus on addressing racial inequities at a local or national level, providing meals for healthcare workers and higher risk populations, and donating critical personal protective equipment.

        "Safety",
        "Safety is our first operating value at Waste Connections.  We are committed to the safety of our employees, customers, and the communities we serve.  Our ultimate goal is to “Drive to ZERO”, that is, to achieve zero incidents and accidents. Our success in safety is driven by our self-directed and empowered employees taking personal ownership for their safety and the safety of those around them.  As servant leaders, we endeavor every day to protect our employees and the communities we are privileged to work in and around. We utilize on-board event recording technology to identify both risky behavior, which is coached, and best practices, which are reinforced.  We have developed a risk-based scoring system for our drivers to improve their safe driving skills and hold our leaders responsible for the performance of the employees they are privileged to serve. ",
        "In 2020, this behavior-based approach to safety resulted in a reduction in our incident rate by approximately 12%, with over 60% of our operating locations posting zero safety-related incidents or reduced incident frequency over the prior year.",
        "Safety training is an integral part of our culture of safety.  To reinforce safe driving skills and safe work practices throughout Waste Connections, we require both initial training for all new driver employees and reinforcement training each year.  Areas of focus in training include: “Target 4” defensive driving, Smith System driving fundamentals, Injury & Illness prevention, and Safe Work Practices training.  We further emphasize the importance of safety through regular tailgate safety meetings and rollout safety instructions for our drivers, and through the utilization of electronic safety communication boards, safety alerts, and other communications to heighten awareness and maintain focus every day on the importance of safety.  ",
        "While we attribute our successful safety record to our culture and behavior-based approach, we recognize that advances in fleet design and technology can be important tools in identifying risky behaviors and providing coaching opportunities to further our efforts to achieve our long-term aspirational target of a 25% reduction in incident rates as described in our 2020 Sustainability Report (www.wasteconnections.com/sustainability). To that end, in 2020, we initiated a two-year, $10 million fleet-wide upgrade of our on-board event recording technology and introduced Freightliner EconicSD trucks with an overhauled cab design that incorporates many of the safety features already included in passenger vehicles, as well as an integrated collision mitigation system, enhanced visibility, and several ergonomic improvements.  ",
        "Culture/Servant Leadership",
        "At Waste Connections, we maintain that our purposeful culture drives differentiated results, and therefore investing in our people is a priority as we employ an approach guided by Servant Leadership. This concept inverts the traditional management hierarchy, positioning leaders to serve their employees both professionally and personally. The philosophy empowers employees by prioritizing their needs, sharing responsibility and driving personal development.  As a result, a significant amount of management time and resources are dedicated to leadership training and development.",
        "Training and Development",
        "Our leadership development efforts focus on multi-day Servant Leadership training sessions, in which approximately 25% of our leadership team participated in 2020 in spite of the limitations on in-person training as a result of COVID-19-related travel restrictions.  These leadership training sessions, generally conducted in-person but also available online, are developed and administered by dedicated internal resources and also include participation by the senior leadership team. ",
        "In addition, the Company provides a broad range of other training and on-the-job learning opportunities, including district management training, varying leadership webinar topics, and other safety, sales, maintenance, operations and financial training courses engaging every level of employee throughout the Company.  Through our Learning Management System (“LMS”), we track employee progress and can utilize the LMS to share new course topics and additional content.",

        "We strive to make Waste Connections a great place to work. Our approach to attracting safe, productive workers includes a focus on providing full time, stable, local jobs with competitive pay and benefits.  ",
        "Our pay and benefits strategy is designed to provide programs and services that help meet the varying needs of our employees, particularly during challenging periods like the COVID-19 pandemic, when we increased our targeted minimum wage to $15 per hour and introduced the Waste Connections Scholarship Program, in addition to providing discretionary supplemental pay and benefits, including expanded access to our Employee Relief Fund. Our total rewards package for front line employees includes market-competitive pay, bonus opportunities, affordable and comprehensive healthcare plans, market-leading retirement benefits, generous and flexible time off plans, and the opportunity to share in the Company’s success through an Employee Share Purchase Plan.  Our leaders also are eligible for incentive compensation programs consisting of an annual cash bonus, equity, or both, dependent on their contributions to improving safety, financial results, and key human capital measures like turnover, employee development and employee survey scores.  ",
        "Employee Engagement",
        "Beyond compensation and benefits, we believe employee engagement includes increased investments in training and development of our leaders and frontline employees, and innovating new technology offerings to increase connectivity both inside and outside of the Company, using a variety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication, including employee resource groups.  We recognize the importance of engagement in driving culture and increasing retention, which was magnified in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the use of remote alternatives to in-person training and development and highlighted the importance of connectivity both inside and outside of the Company. ",
        "Indicators of employee engagement include retention, voluntary turnover and satisfaction, as measured through annual Servant Leadership surveys.  In 2020, our total turnover improved by 11.2%, with voluntary turnover down 18.0% on a year-over-year basis.  ",
        "We conduct an annual Servant Leadership survey, which provides employees the opportunity to evaluate their managers on an anonymous basis and provide written feedback. We target continuous improvement in the scores as an element of the long-term aspirational goals included in our 2020 Sustainability Report.  In 2020, our managers’ Servant Leadership scores increased by 1.9%, with an employee response rate of over 87%.",
        "Diversity and Inclusion",
        "We are committed to building and developing diverse teams that function in an environment of mutual respect, where employees feel valued, empowered to contribute and positioned for success.  ",
        "In keeping with our efforts to support and encourage diversity and inclusion, we have undertaken several initiatives, including adopting in 2019 a formal Diversity Policy for our Board of Directors and Senior Management with aspirational targets for female Board representation, and additional disclosure on workforce composition.  In addition, in 2020, we incorporated diversity and inclusion into Servant Leadership training, focused our leadership summit on understanding and mitigating unintended biases, expanded our Servant Leadership assessments of managers by employees to include diversity and inclusion, enhanced recruiting practices to ensure the broadest candidate pools, established financial commitments to organizations that focus on racial inequities and that support women and children at risk, and supported the development of resource groups including our Women’s Network and Veterans’ S.E.R.V.E. Network. Waste Connections is a signatory to the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion within the workplace.  ",

We continuously monitor and evaluate new technologies and investments that can enhance our commitment to the environment and improve our competitive positioning. We remain committed to growing and expanding these efforts as our industry and technology continue to evolve. To that end, we have made a $500 million commitment to the advancement of the long-term aspirational targets outlined in our 2020 Sustainability Report. ",
        "The targets include reducing environmental impact through expanded resource recovery capacity, increased landfill gas recovery and biogas generation, and increased on-site leachate treatment at our landfills. In addition, they focus on enhancing employee safety and engagement through reducing safety incident rates, continuous improvement in voluntary turnover, and increased Servant Leadership scores.",

        "Collection Services",
        "We provide collection services to residential, commercial, municipal, industrial and E&P customers. Our services are generally provided under one of the following arrangements:  (1) governmental certificates; (2) exclusive franchise agreements; (3) exclusive municipal contracts; (4) residential subscriptions; (5) residential contracts; or (6) commercial, industrial and E&P service agreements.",
        "Governmental certificates, exclusive franchise agreements and exclusive municipal contracts grant us rights to provide MSW services within specified areas at established rates and are long-term in nature. Governmental certificates, or G Certificates, are unique to the State of Washington and are awarded by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, or WUTC, to solid waste collection service providers in unincorporated areas and electing municipalities. These certificates typically grant the holder the exclusive and perpetual right to provide specific residential, commercial and/or industrial waste services in a defined territory at specified rates, subject to divestiture and/or overlap or cancellation by the WUTC on specified, limited grounds. Franchise agreements typically provide an exclusive period of seven years or longer for a specified territory; they specify a broad range of services to be provided, establish rates for the services and can give the service provider a right of first refusal to extend the term of the agreement. Municipal contracts typically provide a shorter service period and a more limited scope of services than franchise agreements and generally require competitive bidding at the end of the contract term. In markets where exclusive arrangements are not available, we may enter into residential contracts with homeowners’ associations, apartment owners and mobile home park operators, or work on a subscription basis with individual households. In such markets, we may also provide commercial and industrial services under customer service agreements generally ranging from one to five years in duration. Finally, in certain E&P markets with “no pit” rules or other regulations that limit on-site storage or treatment of waste, we offer containers and collection services to provide a closed loop system for the collection of drilling wastes at customers’ well sites and subsequent transportation of the waste to our facilities for treatment and disposal.",
        "Landfill Disposal Services",
        "As of December 31, 2020, we owned or operated 66 MSW landfills, 12 E&P waste landfills, which only accept E&P waste, 13 non-MSW landfills, which only accept construction and demolition, industrial and other non-putrescible waste, and one development stage landfill. Eight of our MSW landfills also received E&P waste during 2020. We generally own landfills to achieve vertical integration in markets where the economic and regulatory environments make landfill ",

        "ownership attractive. We also own landfills in certain markets where it is not necessary to provide collection services because we believe that we are able to attract volume to our landfills, given our location or other market dynamics. Over time, MSW landfills generate a greenhouse gas, methane, which can be converted into a valuable source of clean energy. We deploy gas recovery systems at 51 of our landfills to collect methane, which can then be used to generate electricity for local households, fuel local industrial power plants or power alternative fueled vehicles. In some cases, landfill gas generated at our landfills qualifies as a renewable fuel for which renewable fuel credits may be available.",
        "For landfills we operate but do not own, the owner of the property, generally a municipality, usually holds the permit and we operate the landfill pursuant to a landfill operating agreement for a contracted term, which may be the life of the landfill. Where the contracted term is not the life of the landfill, the property owner is generally responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations. We are responsible for all final capping, closure and post-closure obligations at our operated landfills for which we have life-of-site agreements.",
        "Based on remaining permitted capacity as of December 31, 2020, and projected annual disposal volumes, the average remaining landfill life for our owned and operated landfills and landfills operated, but not owned, under life-of-site agreements, is estimated to be approximately 29 years. Many of our existing landfills have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the amount currently permitted. We regularly consider whether it is advisable, in light of changing market conditions and/or regulatory requirements, to seek to expand or change the permitted waste streams or to seek other permit modifications. We also monitor the available permitted in-place disposal capacity of our landfills on an ongoing basis and evaluate whether to seek capacity expansion using a variety of factors.",
        "We are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at ten of our landfills, for which we consider expansions to be probable. Although we cannot be certain that all future expansions will be permitted as designed, the average remaining landfill life for our owned and operated landfills and landfills operated, but not owned, under life-of-site agreements is estimated to be approximately 32 years when considering remaining permitted capacity, probable expansion capacity and projected annual disposal volume.",

        "Transfer Station Services",
        "We own or operate MSW transfer stations and E&P waste transfer stations with marine access. Transfer stations receive, compact and/or load waste to be transported to landfills or treatment facilities via truck, rail or barge. They extend our direct-haul reach and link collection operations or waste generators with distant disposal or treatment facilities by concentrating the waste stream from a wider area and thus providing better utilization rates and operating efficiencies.",
        "Recycling Services",
        "We offer residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers recycling services for a variety of recyclable materials, including compost, cardboard, mixed paper, plastic containers, glass bottles and ferrous and aluminum metals.

Changes in end market demand as well as other factors can cause fluctuations in the prices for such commodities, which can affect revenue, operating income and cash flows. We believe that recycling will continue to be an important component of local and state solid waste management plans due to the public’s increasing environmental awareness and expanding regulations that mandate or encourage recycling. We also believe that the costs of processing recyclables, including the costs of contamination, which have historically been subsidized by the sale of recycled commodities, need to be fully recognized. To that end, we have increased the fees that we charge for the collection of recyclables and for processing at our recycling facilities to more fully reflect the processing costs associated with the separation of recyclables into marketable commodities. In some instances, we will look to pass the risk associated with the volatility of recycled commodity prices onto our customers. ",
        "E&P Waste Treatment, Recovery and Disposal Services",
        "E&P waste is a broad term referring to the by-products resulting from oil and natural gas exploration and production activity. These generally include: waste created throughout the initial drilling and completion of an oil or natural gas well, such as drilling fluids, drill cuttings, completion fluids and flowback water; production wastes and produced water during a well’s operating life; contaminated soils that require treatment during site reclamation; and substances that require clean-up after a spill, reserve pit clean-up or pipeline rupture. E&P customers are oil and natural gas exploration and production companies operating in the areas that we serve. E&P revenue is therefore driven by vertical and horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing, production and clean-up activity; it is complemented by other services including closed loop collection systems and the sale of recovered products. E&P activity varies across market areas which are tied to the natural resource basins in which the drilling activity occurs and reflects the regulatory environment, pricing and disposal alternatives available in any given market.",
        "We provide E&P waste treatment, recovery and/or disposal services from a network of E&P waste landfills, MSW landfills that also receive E&P waste, E&P liquid waste injection wells and E&P waste treatment and oil recovery facilities. Treatment processes vary by site and regulatory jurisdiction. At certain treatment facilities, loads of flowback and produced water and other drilling and production wastes delivered by our customers are sampled, assessed and tested by third parties according to state regulations. Solids contained in a waste load are deposited into a land treatment cell where liquids are removed from the solids and are sent through an oil recovery system before being injected into saltwater disposal injection wells or placed in evaporation cells that utilize specialized equipment to accelerate evaporation of liquids. In certain locations, fresh water is then added to the remaining solids in the cell to “wash” the solids several times to remove contaminants, including oil and grease, chlorides and other contaminants, to ensure the solids meet specific regulatory criteria that, in certain areas, are administered by third-party labs and submitted to the regulatory authorities.",
        "COMPETITION ",
        "The North America municipal solid waste, or MSW, services industry is highly competitive and requires substantial labor and capital resources. Our competition includes: three publicly-held solid waste companies—Waste Management, Inc., Republic Services, Inc. and GFL Environmental, Inc.; several regional, publicly held and privately owned companies; and several thousand small, local, privately owned companies, including independent waste brokers, some of which we believe have accumulated substantial goodwill in their markets. We compete for collection, transfer and disposal volume based primarily on the price and, to a lesser extent, quality of our services. We also compete with operators of alternative disposal facilities, including incinerators, and with counties, municipalities and solid waste districts that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations. Public sector operators may have financial and other advantages over us because of their access to user fees and similar charges, tax revenues, tax-exempt financing and the ability to flow-control waste streams to publicly owned disposal facilities.",
        "From time to time, competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand their market shares or service areas or to win competitively bid municipal contracts. These practices may cause us to reduce the price of our services or, if we elect not to do so, to lose business. We provide a significant amount of our residential, commercial and industrial collection services under exclusive franchise and municipal contracts and G Certificates. Exclusive franchises and municipal contracts may be subject to periodic competitive bidding. Competition in the solid waste industry is also ",

        "The U.S. and Canadian MSW services industries have undergone significant consolidation, and we encounter competition in our efforts to acquire collection operations, transfer stations and landfills. We generally compete for acquisition candidates with publicly owned regional and national waste management companies. Accordingly, it may become uneconomical for us to make further acquisitions or we may be unable to locate or acquire suitable acquisition candidates at price levels and on terms and conditions that we consider appropriate, particularly in markets we do not already serve.",
        "Competition for E&P waste comes primarily from smaller regional companies that utilize a variety of disposal methods and generally serve specific geographic markets. We also compete in certain markets with publicly held and privately owned companies such as Waste Management, Inc., Republic Services, Inc., Clean Harbors, Inc., US Ecology, Inc., Secure Energy Services Inc., Nuverra Environmental Solutions, Trinity Environmental Services, LLC, Ecoserv, Oilfield Water Logistics (OWL) and others. In addition, customers in many markets have the option of using internal disposal methods or outsourcing to another third-party disposal company. ",
        "REGULATION",
        "Introduction",
        "Our operations in the United States and Canada, including landfills, transfer stations, solid waste transportation, intermodal operations, vehicle maintenance shops, fueling facilities and oilfield waste treatment, recovery and disposal operations, are all subject to extensive and evolving federal, state, provincial and, in some instances, local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, the enforcement of which has become increasingly stringent. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require securing permits or other authorizations (collectively, “permits”) for regulated activities; govern the amount and type of substances that may be released or emitted into the environment in connection with our operations; impose cleanup or corrective action responsibility for releases of regulated substances into the environment; restrict the way we handle, manage or dispose of wastes; limit or prohibit our activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations; and impose specific standards addressing worker protection and health. Compliance is often costly or difficult to achieve, and the violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders, assessment of administrative and civil penalties and even criminal prosecution.",
        "In many instances in the United States, liability is often “strict,” meaning it is imposed without a requirement of intent or fault on the part of the regulated entity. The environmental regulations that affect us in the United States are generally administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, state environmental agencies, and other federal, state and local authorities having jurisdiction over our U.S. operations.",
        "The environmental legislation that affects us in Canada is administered by federal and provincial regulatory agencies, which have jurisdiction over certain aspects of our Canadian operations. The relevant Canadian federal environmental legislation that affects our operations is administered by federal departments such as Environment and Climate Change Canada. Provincial and local agencies and departments administer their own environmental legislation, such as the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. In most instances in Canada, liability for violations of environmental and health and safety laws is imposed without a requirement of intent on the part of the regulated entity, but is subject to a defense of due diligence.",
        "Compliance with existing environmental regulatory requirements and permits requires significant capital and operating expenditures. It is possible that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non-compliance may be incurred in the future. We believe that in recent years, environmental regulation of the industry has increased as have the number of enforcement actions brought by regulatory agencies. It is also possible that other developments, such as the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently foresee or quantify. Moreover, changes in environmental laws or regulations could ",
        "11",

        "reduce the demand for our services and adversely impact our business. We also expend significant resources (both administrative and financial) directed toward development, expansion, acquisition, and permitting of landfills, transfer stations, and other facilities we operate. Regarding any permit issued by a regulatory agency necessary for our operations, there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain all necessary permits or that any such permit held may ultimately be renewed on the same or similar terms. Further, permits obtained impose various requirements and may restrict the size and location of disposal operations, impose limits on the types and amount of waste a facility may receive or manage, as well as a waste disposal facility’s overall capacity. Additional operational conditions or restrictions may be included in the renewal or amendment of a previously issued permit. As regulations change, our permit requirements could become more stringent and compliance may require material expenditures at our facilities, impose significant operational restraints, or require new or additional financial assurance related to our operations. Regarding any permit that has been issued, it remains subject to renewal, modification, suspension or revocation by the agency with jurisdiction.",
        "Various laws impose cleanup or remediation liability on responsible parties, which are discussed in more detail below. Substances subject to cleanup liability have been or may have been disposed of or released on or under certain of our facility sites. At some of our facilities, we have conducted and continue to conduct monitoring or remediation of known soil and groundwater contamination and, as required, we will continue to perform such work. It is possible that monitoring or remediation could be required in the future at other facilities we own or operate, or previously owned or operated. These monitoring and remediation efforts are usually overseen by environmental regulatory agencies. Further, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners or other third parties to file claims for personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by the release of regulated substances into the environment. In addition, from time to time, our intermodal services business undertakes the transport of hazardous materials. This transportation function is also regulated by various federal, state, provincial and potentially local agencies.",
        "A number of major statutes and regulations apply to our operations, which are generally enforced by regulatory agencies. Typically, in the United States, federal statutes establish the general regulatory requirements governing our operations, but in many instances these programs are delegated to the states, which have independent and sometimes more strict regulation. In Canada, it is typically provincial statutes that establish the primary regulatory requirements governing our waste operations. Federal statutes in Canada govern certain aspects of waste management, including international and interprovincial transport of certain kinds of waste. Certain of these statutes in the United States and Canada contain provisions that authorize, under certain circumstances, lawsuits by private citizens to enforce certain statutory provisions. In addition to penalties, some of these statutes authorize an award of attorneys’ fees to parties that successfully bring such an action. Enforcement actions for a violation of these statutes and related rules, or for a violation of or failure to have a permit, which is required by certain of these statutes, may include administrative, civil and criminal/regulatory penalties, as well as injunctive relief in some instances. In our ordinary course of business, we incur significant costs complying with these statutes, regulations and applicable standards they impose.",
        "A brief description of certain of the primary statutes affecting our operations is discussed below.",
        "Laws and Regulations",
        "A.   Waste and Hazardous Substances",
        "1.   The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or RCRA",
        "In the United States, RCRA regulates the generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. Regulations promulgated under RCRA impose broad requirements on the waste management industry. In October 1991, the EPA adopted what are known as the Subtitle D Regulations, which govern solid non-hazardous waste landfills. The Subtitle D Regulations establish, among other things, location restrictions, minimum facility design and performance standards, operating criteria, closure and post-closure requirements, financial assurance requirements, groundwater monitoring requirements, groundwater remediation standards and corrective action requirements. These and other applicable requirements, including permitting, are typically implemented by the states, and in some instances, states have enacted more stringent requirements.",
        "12",
        "Table of Contents",
        "Waste related to oil and gas exploration and production, or “E&P,” is typically regulated differently than those wastes designated as “hazardous waste.” Regarding the management and disposal of E&P waste, although E&P wastes may contain hazardous constituents, most E&P waste is exempt from stringent RCRA regulation as a hazardous waste. We are required to obtain permits for the land treatment and disposal of E&P waste as part of our operations. The construction, operation and closure of E&P waste land treatment and disposal operations are generally regulated at the state level. These regulations vary widely from state to state. None of our oilfield waste recycling, treatment and disposal facilities are currently permitted to accept hazardous wastes. Some wastes handled by us that currently are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA or other applicable statutes if changes in laws or regulations were to occur. If the RCRA E&P waste exemption is repealed or modified, we could become subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.",
        "A breach of laws or regulations governing facilities we operate may result in suspension or revocation of necessary permits, civil liability, and imposition of fines and penalties. Moreover, if we experience a delay in obtaining, are unable to obtain, or suffer the revocation of required permits, we may be unable to serve our customers, our operations may be interrupted and our growth and revenue may be limited.",
        "RCRA also regulates underground storage of petroleum and other materials it defines as “regulated substances.” RCRA requires tank registration, compliance with technical standards for tanks, release detection and reporting and corrective action, among other things. Certain of our facilities and operations are subject to these requirements, which are typically implemented at the state level and may be more stringent in certain states.",
        "2.   The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA",
        "CERCLA, which is also known as the “Superfund” law, established a program in the United States allowing federal authorities to provide for the investigation and cleanup of facilities where, or from which, a release of any hazardous substance into the environment has occurred or is threatened. CERCLA defines “hazardous substances” broadly. One of the primary ways that CERCLA addresses a release or threatened release of hazardous substances is by imposing strict, joint and several liability for cleanup on its broad categories of responsible parties. This means that responsible parties can bear liability without fault and that each responsible party potentially could bear liability for the entirety of cleanup costs, notwithstanding its individual contribution. Generally, responsible parties are current owners and/or operators of the contaminated site; former owners and operators of the site at the time when the hazardous substances were disposed; any person who arranged for treatment or disposal of the hazardous substances; and transporters who selected the disposal site. In addition to CERCLA’s liability framework, the EPA may issue orders directing responsible parties to respond to releases of hazardous substances. Further, the EPA and private parties, who have response liability to the EPA or who have incurred response costs, can bring suit against other responsible parties to seek to recover certain costs incurred in their response efforts. CERCLA also imposes liability for the cost of evaluating and remedying damage to natural resources. Various states have enacted laws analogous to and independent of CERCLA that also impose liability, which is typically strict and joint and several, for investigation, cleanup and other damages associated with the release of hazardous or other regulated substances. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or hazardous and other substances regulated under similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations. As a result, we may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA or similar states statutes for all or part of the costs required to cleanup sites if and where these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. CERCLA and these analogous state laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for acts or conditions that were in compliance with applicable laws at a prior time. Under certain circumstances, our sales of residual crude oil collected as part of the saltwater injection process could result in liability to us if the residual crude contains hazardous substances or is covered by one of the state statutes and the entity to which the oil was transferred fails to manage and, as necessary, dispose of it or components thereof in accordance with applicable laws.",
        "3.   Canadian Waste Legislation",
        "The primary waste laws regulating our business in Canada are imposed by the provinces. These include provincial laws that regulate waste management, including requirements to obtain permits and approvals, and regulations with respect to the operation of transfer stations and landfilling sites. Each provincial jurisdiction in Canada has its own regulatory regime; however, the key requirements under these regimes are similar across Canada. For example, the Environmental ",

        "Protection Act, or the EP Act, in Ontario and its underlying regulations regulate the generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of wastes in Ontario, among other things. The EP Act requires an approval or, in some cases, a registration, for the establishment, operation or alteration of a waste management system (which includes all facilities or equipment used in connection with waste) or a waste disposal site. The specific terms and conditions of an approval may impose emission limits, monitoring and reporting requirements, siting and operating criteria, financial assurance or insurance and decommissioning requirements. Certain landfilling sites are subject to more stringent regulatory requirements that can include detailed prescribed design standards, leachate collection systems, landfill gas management or collection systems and/or site closure plans including post-closure care requirements. The federal Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 imposes requirements with respect to the interprovincial and international movement of hazardous wastes and hazardous recyclable material, which can affect the movement of wastes and recyclables to our Canadian facilities. The expansion or establishment of certain waste management projects, including waste treatment and landfilling sites, may also be subject to provincial or federal environmental assessment requirements.",
        "A breach of laws or regulations governing our operations may result in suspension or revocation of necessary approvals and imposition of fines and penalties. Moreover, if we experience a delay in obtaining, are unable to obtain, or suffer the revocation of required approvals, we may be unable to serve our customers, our operations may be interrupted, and our growth and revenue may be limited.",
        "4.   Canadian Contaminated Sites Legislation",
        "There are provincial and federal laws in Canada that regulate spills and releases of substances into the environment and require the remediation of contaminated sites. Clean up of contaminated sites in connection with our business is primarily regulated by provincial environmental laws. Each province has its own regulatory regime; however, the key requirements under these regimes are similar across Canada. For example, the EP Act in Ontario authorizes the agency to issue orders to responsible persons to undertake remedial or other corrective actions to investigate, monitor, and remediate the discharge or presence of contaminants in the environment. These orders can generally be issued on a joint and several liability basis to categories of responsible persons, including persons who caused or permitted the discharge of a contaminant, persons who owned the discharged substance, as well as current and past owners of lands or the source of the contamination and persons who have or have had management or control over lands or the source of the contamination. Responsible parties can bear liability under an order without fault.  The costs to comply with an order can be very substantial. Some provincial jurisdictions provide a statutory right to compensation from the owner or person in control of a substance that is discharged into the environment to any person who suffers loss as a result. The federal government has also enacted laws that regulate the release of certain substances into the environment. We handle many contaminants and pollutants in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be liable under provincial and federal statutes for all or part of required cleanup costs if substances have been released into the environment. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes (including substances disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or remediate contaminated property (including soil and groundwater contamination, whether from prior owners or operators or other historic activities or spills).",
        "B.   Wastewater/Stormwater Discharge",
        "1.   The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or the Clean Water Act",
        "The Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, solid waste disposal facilities, transfer stations and oilfield waste facilities into Waters of the United States, or WOTUS, including surface and potentially ground waters. Under the Clean Water Act, sites or facilities that discharge pollutants to waters of the United States must have a permit authorizing that discharge. If run-off or other contaminants from our owned or operated transfer stations or oilfield waste facilities, or run-off, collected leachate or other contaminants from our owned or operated landfills or other facilities is discharged into streams, rivers or other regulated waters, the Clean Water Act would require a discharge permit. These permits typically contain requirements to conduct monitoring and, under certain circumstances, to treat and reduce the quantity of pollutants in such discharge. Further, if a landfill or other facility discharges wastewater through a treatment works, it may be required to comply with additional permitting and other specific requirements. Also, virtually all landfills are required to comply with the EPA’s storm water regulations, which are designed to prevent the introduction of contaminated storm water run-off into United States’ waters.",
        "14",
        "Table of Contents",
        "At this time, the ultimate regulatory test for defining WOTUS is unclear, and the determination therefor will be based upon the outcome of regulatory promulgations and associated litigation, that are currently pending. The manner in which WOTUS is defined could affect our operations by potentially increasing or modifying regulatory requirements governing our discharges. In 2015, the Clean Water Rule was promulgated, which would expand federal control over many U.S. water resources by broadening the definition of WOTUS, thereby potentially classifying a larger range of water resource types as jurisdictional under the Clean Water Act. Since promulgation of the 2015 Clean Water Rule, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers, or the Corps, have sought to rescind it and to promulgate a revised definition of WOTUS that would establish federal jurisdiction more narrowly, thereby reducing the scope of Clean Water Act applicability. To that end, on December 11, 2018, the EPA and the Corps proposed a rule to redefine WOTUS. Eventually, in October 2019, the 2015 Clean Water Rule was repealed, effectively reverting to the pre-2015 regulatory definition as of December 23, 2019.  The EPA published a new Navigable Waters Protection Rule on April 21, 2020, which went into effect on June 22, 2020. This rule narrows the scope of wetlands and waterways under federal jurisdiction. The new rule has already been challenged in court in eight states and the District of Columbia. The Navigable Waters Protection Rule is currently in effect in every state and district except for Colorado, where a federal judge granted a stay. The scope of the WOTUS definition will likely remain fluid until litigation is finalized. To the extent that a regulation expands the scope of the jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act with respect to WOTUS, we could face increased costs and delays in obtaining permits under the Clean Water Act. Further, regulatory uncertainty may increase costs to our customers. ",
        "Additionally, the Clean Water Act’s spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements require development of site-specific plans, and appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help contain and prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon storage tank release. The Clean Water Act also contains provisions that can prohibit development or require permitting before construction or expansion of a landfill may occur in areas designated as wetlands. Various states in which we operate or may operate in the future have been delegated authority to implement the Clean Water Act and its permitting requirements, and some of these states have adopted regulations that are more stringent than federal Clean Water Act requirements.",
        "2.   Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA",
        "Our United States E&P underground injection operations are subject to the SDWA, as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under the SDWA, the EPA established the underground injection control, or UIC, program, which includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. Certain state regulations require us to obtain permits from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate our underground injection wells. Leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our UIC permit, fines and penalties, the incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and potential liability to third parties for property damages. In July 2018, the EPA partnered with New Mexico to assess alternatives to immediate disposal of E&P wastewater by reusing it and/or treating it for reintroduction into the hydrologic cycle, as well as potential regulations related thereto. Moreover, in May 2019, EPA issued its draft Study of Oil and Gas Extraction Wastewater Management Under the Clean Water Act regarding EPA’s examination of whether to alter its regulation of the treatment and discharge of E&P wastewater. The final report was released in May 2020. The EPA has yet to determine its next steps for managing E&P wastewater under the Clean Water Act.  If regulations requiring reuse or treatment are developed and implemented on a broad scale, it may increase our compliance costs or reduce the volume of E&P wastes that may be disposed of via underground injection.",
        "3.   Canadian Water Protection Legislation",
        "There is legislation in Canada at both the federal and provincial levels that protects water quality and regulates the discharge of substances into the aquatic environment. Federal water pollution control authority is derived primarily from the Fisheries Act, which contains provisions for the protection of water quality and fish habitat. This includes a general prohibition on the deposit of any deleterious substances into water that is frequented by fish, unless otherwise authorized. There is legislation in each provincial jurisdiction that also protects water sources and regulates water pollution, and generally requires an approval or permit for a discharge of any effluent, including in some cases stormwater, into a water body. For example, in Ontario, the Ontario Water Resources Act, or OWRA, prohibits the discharge of material of any kind into any water that may impair the quality of the water. The OWRA requires that an approval be obtained for the use ",

        "and operation of certain sewage and stormwater works. Such approvals typically contain monitoring requirements and impose restrictions on effluent characteristics. Other provinces in Canada have similar regimes for the protection of water. If run-off or other contaminants from our landfills, transfer stations or other waste facilities is discharged or migrates into waters and causes impairment, we could face significant liability under provincial and federal laws.",
        "C.   Air Emissions",
        "1.   The Clean Air Act, or CAA",
        "In the United States, the CAA generally regulates the emissions of air pollutants from a variety of sources, including certain landfills and oilfield waste facilities, based on factors such as the date of the construction and tons per year of emissions of regulated pollutants. Typically, federal requirements are delegated to the states and implemented at the state level. The CAA and analogous state laws require permits for and impose other restrictions on facilities and equipment that have the potential to emit pollutants into the atmosphere. Under the CAA, a source deemed to be a major source generally must be authorized by a permit. In those situations where major source permitting is not required, typically state laws and rules will require permitting as a type of minor source. Larger landfills and landfills located in areas where the ambient air does not meet certain air quality standards called for by the CAA may be subject to even more extensive air pollution controls and emissions limitations. In addition to the potential CAA permitting of landfill facilities, CAA permitting may be required for the construction of gas collection and flaring systems, composting and other operations. In some instances, federal operating permits may be required depending on the nature and volume of air emissions.",
        "In addition to permitting, the CAA imposes other regulatory obligations, including, in some instances, performance standards on operations and equipment. The EPA has issued what are known as new source performance standards, or NSPS, and emissions guidelines, which impose requirements regarding control of landfill gases from new and existing large landfills. The EPA has also issued regulations imposing maximum achievable control technology, or MACT, on large MSW landfills. The MACT standards impose limits on landfill emissions and often require installation of landfill gas collection systems. The EPA published a final rule on March 26, 2020, which declined to amend the MACT at that time.  Additional or more stringent regulations of our facilities may occur in the future, which could increase operating costs or impose additional compliance burdens. ",
        "On August 29, 2016, the EPA issued “Subpart XXX” that applies to MSW landfills constructed, modified or reconstructed after July 17, 2014. The Subpart XXX NSPS reduce the non-methane organic compounds, or NMOC, emissions threshold at which MSW landfills must install emission controls, requires monitoring surface emissions of methane, monitoring of temperature and pressure at the wellhead of landfill gas collection systems and imposes other requirements. Further, the EPA promulgated “Guidelines” on August 29, 2016, known as Subpart Cf, which require states to implement similar requirements on existing landfills that are not subject to NSPS Subpart XXX. Subpart Cf updates existing Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for existing MSW landfills. The Subpart Cf Guidelines apply to landfills that accepted waste after November 8, 1987 and commenced construction or modification on or before July 17, 2014. Subpart XXX and Subpart Cf are intended to result in the reduction of landfill gas emissions, including methane, by lowering the thresholds at which a MSW landfill must install a gas collection and control system. Subpart Cf will ultimately affect existing sources that are not affected by Subpart XXX. In October 2018, the EPA proposed a rule to delay implementation of the Guidelines, and indicated that it was reconsidering certain portions thereof. The EPA is still in the process of reconsideration. In March 2020, the EPA finalized amendments to the most recent MSW Landfill NSPS and emission guidelines that would allow regulated entities to demonstrate compliance with landfill gas control, operating, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements by following the corresponding requirements in the MSW Landfills hazardous air pollutant regulations at Subpart AAAA. These amendments were intended to improve compliance and implementation of the regulations. EPA published its final rules on August 26, 2019, under which the deadline for states to submit their plans to implement the emission control requirements was extended from May 29, 2017 to August 30, 2021.  Various groups are litigating this deadline extension in the D.C. Circuit. The rules also give EPA up to six months to review the completeness of state plans and an additional 12 months thereafter to approve or disapprove such plans. Regardless of the time extensions that the new rules allow, eventual compliance with these regulatory requirements could result in significant additional compliance costs, which we will incur in our ordinary course of business. In addition, state air regulatory requirements may impose additional restrictions beyond federal requirements, which could also result in ",

        "compliance costs. For example, some state air programs uniquely regulate odor and the emission of certain specific toxic air pollutants.",
        "The EPA recently modified, or is in the process of modifying, other standards promulgated under the CAA in a manner that could increase our compliance costs. For example, the EPA has discussed modifying national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) applicable to particulate matter, carbon monoxide and oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, ozone and other standards to make them more stringent. Current rule proposals retain 2015 NAAQS levels; a new administration, however, may propose more restrictive standards. It is possible these additional regulations could result in additional capital or operating expenditures. We do not believe, however, they will have a material adverse effect on our business as a whole. Further, our customers’ operations may be subject to existing and future CAA permitting and regulatory requirements that could have a material effect on their operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business.",
        "2.   Canadian Air Quality Legislation",
        "In Canada, the primary laws regulating air emissions from our operations come from provincial laws. Provincial laws may require approvals for air emissions and may impose other restrictions on facilities and equipment that have the potential to emit pollutants into the atmosphere. Provincial laws may require the construction of landfill gas management systems, including gas collection and flaring systems, which are subject to approvals or other regulatory requirements. Failure to obtain an approval or comply with approval requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative or regulatory penalties.",
        "D.   Occupational Health and Safety",
        "1.   The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, or the OSH Act",
        "In the United States, the OSH Act is administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, and many state agencies whose programs have been approved by OSHA. The OSH Act establishes employer responsibilities for worker health and safety, including the obligation to maintain a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, comply with adopted worker protection standards, maintain certain records, provide workers with required disclosures, and implement certain health and safety training programs. Various OSHA standards may apply to our operations, including standards concerning notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work, the handling of asbestos and asbestos-containing materials and worker training and emergency response programs. Moreover, the Department of Transportation, OSHA, and other agencies regulate and have jurisdiction concerning the transport, movement, and related safety of hazardous and other regulated materials. In some instances, state and local agencies also regulate the safe transport of such materials to the extent not preempted by federal law.",
        "2.   Canadian Occupational Health and Safety Laws",
        "In Canada, each province establishes and administers a provincial occupational health and safety regime. Similar to the United States, these regimes generally identify the rights and responsibilities of employers, supervisors and workers. Employers are required to implement all prescribed safety requirements and to exercise reasonable care to protect employees from workplace hazards, among other things. Various occupational health and safety standards may apply to our Canadian operations, including requirements relating to communication of and exposure to hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work, the handling of asbestos and asbestos-containing materials and worker training and emergency response programs. In addition to the provincial departments of transportation, Transport Canada has jurisdiction to regulate the transportation of dangerous goods, which can include wastes.",
        "E.   Additional Regulatory Considerations",
        "We also review regulatory developments that may affect our business, including, among others, those described below.",
        "17",
        "Table of Contents",
        "1.   State, Provincial and Local Regulation",
        "In addition to the federal statutes regulating our operations, each state or province where we operate or may operate in the future has laws and regulations governing the management, generation, storage, treatment, handling, transportation, and disposal of solid waste, E&P waste, occupational safety and health, water and air pollution and, in most cases, the siting, design, operation, maintenance, corrective action, closure and post-closure maintenance of landfills and transfer stations. Further, many municipalities have enacted or could enact ordinances, local laws and regulations affecting our operations, including zoning and health measures that limit solid waste management activities to specified sites or activities. Other jurisdictions have enacted “fitness” rules focusing on companywide and overall corporate compliance history in making permitting decisions. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted flow control provisions that direct or restrict the delivery of solid wastes to specific facilities, laws that grant the right to establish franchises for collection services and bidding for such franchises and bans or other restrictions on the movement of solid wastes into a municipality. Specific state and local permits for our operations may be required and may be subject to periodic renewal, modification or revocation by the issuing agencies. There has also been an increasing trend at the state, provincial and local levels to mandate and encourage waste reduction at the source and recycling, and to prohibit or restrict landfill disposal of certain types of solid wastes, such as food waste, yard waste, leaves, tires, electronic equipment waste, painted wood and other construction and demolition debris. The enactment of laws or regulations reducing the volume and types of wastes available for transport to and disposal in landfills could prevent us from operating our facilities at their full capacity.",
        "2.    Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation",
        "We do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, but we do provide treatment, recovery, and disposal services for the fluids used and wastes generated by our customers in such operations. Recently, there has been increased public concern regarding the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect the environment, including drinking water supplies. Proposals have been made to enact separate federal, state or local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. Laws and regulations have been proposed and/or adopted at the federal, state and local levels that would regulate, restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing operations or require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Certain states and localities have placed moratoria or bans on hydraulic fracturing or the disposal of waste therefrom, or have considered the same.",
        "In June 2016, the EPA promulgated a rule prohibiting discharges of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works, or POTWs. Further, the EPA promulgated regulations known as Reg. OOOO and Reg. OOOOa, which, among other things, require control of methane and volatile organic compound, or VOC, emissions related to certain well completions and certain tankage and equipment. Certain provisions of Reg. OOOOa are currently the subject of litigation. In June 2017, the EPA proposed a two-year stay of portions of the rules and in October 2018, the EPA proposed revisions to Reg. OOOOa. The EPA finalized its reconsideration of the OOOOa regulations in two rules, referred to as the “Review Rule” on September 14, 2020 and the “Reconsideration Rule” on September 15, 2020. These rules removed a segment of the E&P industry from OOOOa regulation and eliminated methane emission standards.  While these revisions may reduce some regulatory burdens to the E&P industry, the rules continue to require regulated sites to monitor VOC emissions and undertake timely repairs. As such, the revisions may not materially reduce costs for our E&P customer base. Both rules have been challenged in court, and the incoming change in administration may prompt revisitation of these rules. Regardless of potential regulatory revisions, these rules can require oil and gas operators to expend material sums, which may reduce our customers’ E&P activities and could have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, several states have adopted or proposed laws and regulations analogous to or even more stringent than the federal rules that would remain in effect regardless of the outcome of any federal stay or litigation. Further, several states in which we conduct business require oil and natural gas operators to disclose information concerning their operations, which could result in increased public scrutiny.",
        "The EPA has contemplated additional rule making. In May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or ANPR, under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, seeking comment on whether and how the EPA should regulate the reporting or disclosure of the use of hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures and their constituents. Several states have implemented such requirements. Additionally, in December 2016, the EPA released a study on the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. In that study, the EPA found evidence that hydraulic fracturing activity can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, but data gaps limited the ",

The study assessed the regulatory status of CWTs, characteristics of wastewaters discharged from them, available treatment technologies and associated costs. EPA has yet to implement regulations or guidelines based on this study. The impact of rules that the EPA is contemplating, has proposed or has recently promulgated will be uncertain until the rules are finalized and fully implemented.",
        "If new federal, state or local laws, regulations or policies restricting hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly for our customers to perform hydraulic fracturing. Any such regulations limiting, prohibiting or imposing operational requirements on hydraulic fracturing could reduce oil and natural gas E&P activities by our customers and, therefore, adversely affect our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance.",
        "3.   Disposal of Drilling Fluids",
        "Certain of our facilities accept drilling fluids and other E&P wastes for disposal via underground injection. The disposal of drilling fluids is generally regulated at the state level, and claims, including some regulatory actions, have been brought against some owners or operators of these types of facilities for nuisance, seismic disturbances and other claims in relation to the operation of underground injection facilities. To date, our facilities have not been subject to any such litigation, but could be in the future.",
        "4.   Climate Change Laws and Regulations",
        "Generally, the promulgation of climate change laws or regulations restricting or regulating greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions could increase our costs to operate. The EPA’s current and proposed regulation of GHG emissions may adversely impact our operations. In 2009, the EPA made an endangerment finding allowing GHGs to be regulated under the CAA. The CAA requires stationary sources of air pollution to obtain New Source Review, or NSR, permits prior to construction and, in some cases, Title V operating permits. Pursuant to the EPA’s rulemakings and interpretations, certain Title V and NSR Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, permits issued on or after January 2, 2011, must address GHG emissions. As a result, new or modified emissions sources may be required to install Best Available Control Technology to limit GHG emissions. The EPA’s recently adopted Subpart XXX also requires the reduction of GHG emissions from new or modified landfills, and the Guidelines, known as Subpart Cf, published by the EPA in August 2016, will require the reduction of GHG emissions from existing landfills, although the EPA has delayed implementation of, and is reconsidering portions of, these regulations, as detailed above. In addition, the EPA’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule sets monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements applicable to certain landfills and other entities.",
        "In June 2018, the Canadian federal government enacted the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, which established a national carbon-pricing regime starting in 2019 for provinces and territories in Canada where there is no provincial regime in place or where the provincial regime does not meet the federal benchmark. Often referred to as the federal backstop, the federal carbon-pricing regime consists of a carbon levy that is applied to fossil fuels and an output-based pricing system (“OBPS”) that is applied to certain industrial facilities with reported emissions of 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2e”) or more per year. The carbon levy applies to prescribed liquid, gaseous, and solid fuels at a rate that is equivalent to $30 per tonne of CO2e in 2020, increasing annually, until it reaches $50 per tonne of CO2e by 2022. On November 19, 2020, the federal government introduced Bill C-12, the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which establishes the framework for national GHG emissions reduction targets to attain net-zero emissions by 2050. ",
        "Certain states and several Canadian provinces have promulgated legislation and regulations to limit GHG emissions through requirements of specific controls, carbon levies, cap and trade programs or other measures. Comprehensive GHG legislation or regulation, including carbon pricing, affects not only our business, but also that of our customers.",
        "Heightened regulation of our customers’ operations could also adversely affect our business. The regulation of GHG emissions from oil and gas E&P operations may increase the costs to our customers of developing and producing hydrocarbons and, as a result, may have an indirect and adverse effect on the amount of E&P waste delivered to our facilities. On June 3, 2016, the EPA promulgated NSPS Subpart OOOOa, which in conjunction with NSPS Subpart OOOO ",

        "sets methane and VOC requirements for certain new and modified sources, including hydraulically fractured oil wells, certain tankage and equipment. Although, as discussed above, the EPA revised these regulations in September 2020, they are currently being challenged in court and they will continue to require, in some instances, additional emissions controls and increased capital costs for our customers, which could reduce their E&P activities, and subsequently negatively impact our business operations. As discussed above, certain states have enacted rules analogous to or even more stringent than the federal rules.",
        "These statutes and regulations increase our costs and our customers’ costs, and future climate change statutes and regulations may have an impact as well. If we are unable to pass such higher costs through to our customers, or if our customers’ costs of developing and producing hydrocarbons increase, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. The impact of any potential rules affecting existing sources is uncertain.",
        "5.   Flow Control/Interstate Waste Restrictions",
        "Certain permits and state and local regulations, known as flow control restrictions, may limit a landfill’s or transfer station’s ability to accept waste that originates from specified geographic areas, to import out-of-state waste or wastes originating outside the local jurisdictions or to otherwise accept non-local waste. While certain courts have deemed these laws to be unenforceable, other courts have not. Certain state and local jurisdictions may seek to enforce flow control restrictions contractually. These actions could limit or prohibit the importation of wastes originating outside of local jurisdictions or direct that wastes be handled at specified facilities. These restrictions could limit the volume of wastes we can manage in jurisdictions at issue and also result in higher disposal costs for our collection operations. If we are unable to pass such higher costs through to our customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Additionally, certain local jurisdictions have sought or may seek to impose extraterritorial obligations on our operations in an effort to affect flow control and may enforce tax and fee arrangements on behalf of such jurisdictions.",
        "6. Potential Regulation of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) and Other Emerging Contaminants",
        "At this time, several substances are being reviewed by governmental authorities for potential heightened regulation, including PFAS. PFAS, a class of man-made chemicals, have been in use since the 1940s and are found in many consumer products including textiles, fire suppressants, cookware, packaging, and plastics. These types of products and materials can be found in wastes that our facilities accept and have accepted for management and disposal. PFAS are environmentally persistent and tend to bioaccumulate in exposed populations. PFAS contamination has been found in the air, soil, and water, including drinking water. This contamination has prompted action by Congress, the EPA, and several states.",
        "The EPA has begun to examine the potential regulation of PFAS materials under the SWDA, CERCLA, and TSCA.  The EPA established lifetime health advisories for PFAS materials in May 2016.  The regulatory development process for listing two PFAS chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), as hazardous substances under CERCLA was initiated in 2019. Listing PFAS as a CERCLA hazardous substance would potentially expand the universe of substances giving rise to cleanup liability. EPA has published Action Plans to potentially address the risk of PFAS contamination. The most recent Action Plan, which was published in February 2020, included preliminary determinations to regulate PFOA and PFOS, as well as an analysis of tools available to regulate PFAS. The EPA also released a memorandum in November 2020 detailing an interim strategy for including PFAS in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) waste water discharge permits under the CWA. ",
        "The U.S. House of Representatives passed House Resolution 535 in January 2020. The bill specifically calls for the EPA to add PFAS to the list of hazardous air pollutants under the CAA and initiate regulatory limits for major and area sources of air pollutants. The bill, if it passes the Senate, will also establish PFAS effluent limitations and pretreatment standards for point sources under the CWA.",
        "State governments are also beginning to regulate PFAS. Certain states have taken action to limit exposure to PFAS and require remediation of PFAS-related environmental contamination. Much of the state action has been directed at ",

        "The EPA is also considering regulation of other contaminants of concern, including bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, which are common in PVC products. If the EPA moves forward with regulating these or other contaminants of concern, we may face higher compliance costs for, among other things, treatment of leachate and landfill gas.",
        "PFAS chemicals have been the subject of environmental and health reviews by the federal government in Canada. Two PFAS chemicals, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are listed as toxic substances under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999.  PFOS and PFOA are subject to stringent  restrictions on their use in Canada, with additional restrictions pending.  Environmental screening values and standards, and drinking water guidelines, exist in some jurisdictions in Canada in relation to some PFAS. Given the increasing concern regarding PFAS in the environment, including PFAS in groundwater and in leachate at waste disposal sites, increased regulatory requirements may be imposed in Canada in the future. ",
        "Increased regulation of PFAS and other emerging contaminants could adversely affect our operations. Our already-substantial financial obligations associated with post-closure maintenance at our existing landfills may increase and accruals for these obligations may also need to be increased. Guidance calling for enhanced treatment of landfill leachate and landfill gas could potentially increase burdens for disposal of PFAS-containing materials generated by our facilities or accepted at our facilities, some of which may potentially need to be upgraded to accept PFAS-containing waste.

        "Pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA promulgated the Renewable Fuel Standards, or RFS, which require refiners to either blend “renewable fuels,” such as ethanol and biodiesel, into their transportation fuels or to purchase renewable fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers, or RINs, in lieu of blending. In some cases, landfill gas generated at our landfills in the United States and Canada qualifies as a renewable fuel for which RINs are available. Such RINs can be sold by the Company. The price of RINs has been extremely volatile and the value of RINs is dependent upon a variety of factors. The EPA annually establishes the renewable fuel volumes required under the RFS for the following year. The 2020 renewable fuel and 2021 biomass-based diesel volume requirements were published on February 6, 2020, increasing required volumes from 2019 requirements. The regulation is being challenged judicially in the D.C. Circuit, but the challenge remains unresolved. Reductions or limitations on the requirement to blend renewable fuel would likely reduce the volume of RINs purchased to meet the RFS blending requirements. Further, there have been proposals to revise, and in some instances limit, the RFS program in the United States. As recently as October 2019, House Energy and Commerce Committee members, Representatives Shimkus and Flores, introduced the 21st Century Transportation Fuels Act that aims to eliminate volume-based renewable fuels mandates and instead rely upon the transition to a national octane standard and automobile manufacturing standards to govern fuel composition. This bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change in October 2019, but no further action has been taken.  Various parties have also sought for the executive branch to revise the RFS. Limiting or eliminating the RFS could have the effect of reducing or eliminating the volume of RINs required to meet blending requirements, which could adversely affect the demand for RINS and accordingly the revenue stream we have historically derived from the sale of RINs. ‎",
        "The Renewable Fuels Regulations under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 impose obligations on producers and importers of certain liquid petroleum fuels to acquire renewable fuel compliance units in connection with the fuels they produce or import. Compliance Units can be generated through the blending of renewable fuel into liquid petroleum fuels. Certain provincial jurisdictions in Canada also impose obligations to incorporate renewable fuels into fuels that are distributed within the jurisdiction.  The Canadian federal government published the draft Clean Fuel Regulations under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 on December 19, 2020. The draft Clean Fuel Regulations would impose lifecycle carbon intensity requirements on producers and importers of certain liquid petroleum fuels, which could be satisfied, in part, through compliance credits generated through the supply of low carbon intensity ",

        "G.   Regulation of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Metals, or NORM",
        "Certain states have enacted laws and regulations regulating NORM. In the course of our E&P waste operations, some of our equipment involved in E&P waste management and disposal may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and gas deposits. Further, certain E&P wastes we handle could be NORM contaminated. NORM wastes exhibiting levels of naturally occurring radiation exceeding established state standards are typically subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping, equipment and work area affected by NORM waste may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. It is possible that we may incur significant costs or liabilities associated with inadvertently handling NORM contaminated waste or equipment that becomes NORM contaminated based on exposure or contact with elevated levels of NORM.",
        "H.   Extended Producer Responsibility, or EPR, Regulations",
        "EPR regulations place responsibility on product manufacturers or suppliers to assume certain waste management or recycling responsibility for their products after such products’ useful life or otherwise impose obligations on product manufacturers or suppliers to reduce the volume of waste associated with their products.",
        "EPR regulations have yet to be promulgated at the federal level in the United States, but have been promulgated or considered in state and local jurisdictions in the United States. EPR regulations could have an adverse effect on our business if enacted at the federal level or if widely enacted by state or local governments.",
        "Numerous provincial jurisdictions in Canada have promulgated EPR and related waste diversion legislation and other programs that mandate or encourage recycling and waste reduction and restrict the landfill disposal of certain types of waste. The enactment of new and more stringent regulations reducing the types or volumes of wastes available for disposal in landfills could impact our future operations.",
        "I.   State Public Utility Regulation",
        "In some states, public authorities regulate the rates that landfill operators may charge. The adoption of rate regulation or the reduction of current rates in states in which we own or operate landfills could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.",

        "Risk Management",
        "We maintain environmental and other risk management programs that we believe are appropriate for our business. Our environmental risk management program includes evaluating existing facilities and potential acquisitions for environmental law compliance. We do not presently expect environmental compliance costs to increase materially above current levels, but we cannot predict whether future acquisitions will cause such costs to increase. We also maintain a worker safety program that encourages safe practices in the workplace. Operating practices at our operations emphasize minimizing the possibility of environmental contamination and litigation. Our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable federal, state and provincial regulations.",
        "Insurance",
        "We maintain an insurance program for automobile liability, general liability, employer’s liability claims, environmental liability, cyber liability, employment practices liability and directors’ and officers’ liability as well as for employee group health insurance, property and workers’ compensation. Our loss exposure for insurance claims is generally limited to per incident deductibles or self-insured retentions. Losses in excess of deductible or self-insured retention levels are insured subject to policy limits.",
        "22",
        "Table of Contents",
        "Under our current Company-wide insurance program, we carry per incident deductibles or self-insured retentions ranging from $350,000 to $2 million for cyber liability and directors’ and officers’ liability claims. Additionally, we have umbrella policies with insurance companies for automobile liability, general liability and employer’s liability. Our property insurance limits are in accordance with the replacement values of the insured property. ",
        "Under our current insurance program for our U.S. operations, we carry per incident deductibles or self-insured retentions ranging from $350,000 to $20 million for automobile liability claims, workers’ compensation and employer’s liability claims, general liability claims, employee group health insurance and employment practices liability, environmental liability, and for most property claims, subject to certain additional terms and conditions. Since workers’ compensation is a statutory coverage limited by the various state jurisdictions, the umbrella coverage is not applicable. Our environmental protection insurance policy covers all owned or operated landfills, certain transfer stations and other facilities, subject to the policy terms and conditions. From time to time, actions filed against us include claims for punitive damages, which are generally excluded from coverage under our liability insurance policies. Our policy provides insurance for new pollution conditions that originate after the commencement of our coverage. Pollution conditions existing prior to the commencement of our coverage, if found, could be excluded from coverage.",
        "Under our current insurance program for our Canadian operations, we carry per incident deductibles or self-insured retentions ranging from $350,000 to $2.5 million for automobile liability claims, property claims and environmental liability. Since workers’ compensation is a provincial coverage limited by the various province jurisdictions, the umbrella coverage is not applicable. Employees are eligible to receive health coverage under Canada’s public health care system and, in addition, most employees of our Canadian operations are eligible to participate in group medical and drug coverage plans sponsored by us. Our environmental protection insurance policy covers all owned or operated landfills, certain transfer stations and other facilities, subject to the policy terms and conditions. Our policy provides insurance for new pollution conditions that originate after the commencement of our coverage. Pollution conditions existing prior to the commencement of our coverage, if found, could be excluded from coverage.",
        "Financial Surety Bonds",
        "We use financial surety bonds for a variety of corporate guarantees. The financial surety bonds are primarily used for guaranteeing municipal contract performance and providing financial assurances to meet asset closure and retirement requirements under certain environmental regulations. In addition to surety bonds, such guarantees and obligations may also be met through alternative financial assurance instruments, including insurance, letters of credit and restricted cash and investment deposits. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had provided customers and various regulatory authorities with surety bonds in the aggregate amount of approximately $727.4 million and $661.6 million, respectively, to secure our asset closure and retirement requirements and $482.3 million and $419.3 million, respectively, to secure performance under collection contracts and landfill operating agreements.",
        "We source financial surety bonds from a variety of third-party insurance and surety companies, including a company in which we own a 9.9% interest that, among other activities, issues financial surety bonds to secure landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations for companies operating in the solid waste sector.",
        "SEASONALITY",
        "Based on historic trends, excluding any impact from the COVID-19 pandemic or an economic recession, we would expect our operating results to vary seasonally, with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter, higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters. This seasonality reflects (a) the lower volume of solid waste generated during the late fall, winter and early spring because of decreased construction and demolition activities during winter months in Canada and the U.S., and (b) reduced E&P activity during harsh weather conditions, with expected fluctuation due to such seasonality between our highest and lowest quarters of approximately 10%. In addition, some of our operating costs may be higher in the winter months. Adverse winter weather conditions slow waste collection activities, resulting in higher labor and operational costs. Greater precipitation in the winter increases the weight of collected MSW, resulting in higher disposal costs, which are calculated on a per ton basis. ",

Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, federal and state banking regulators have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if they determine that we have insufficient capital or other resources, or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under this authority, our bank regulators can require us or our subsidiaries to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which we would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions.",

If our regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both.

We are required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports and such other information as the Federal Reserve may request.  Ongoing supervision is provided through regular examinations by the Federal Reserve and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to identify, assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations.

        "Activity Limitations.  Southern National is registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company. Bank holding companies generally are limited to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be closely related to banking, or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies are prohibited from acquiring or obtaining control of more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding voting interests of any company that engages in activities other than those activities permissible for bank holding companies. Examples of activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be permissible are making, acquiring, brokering, or servicing loans; leasing personal property; providing certain investment or financial advice; performing certain data processing services; acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other insurance products in certain locations; and performing certain insurance underwriting activities. The Bank Holding Company Act does not place geographic limits on permissible non-banking activities of bank holding companies. Even with respect to permissible activities, however, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or its control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or control of such subsidiary would pose a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company. ",
        "Source of Strength Obligations.  A bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank. The term “source of financial strength” means the ability of a company, such as us, that directly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of financial distress.  The appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution (in the case of the Bank, this agency is the Federal Reserve) may require reports from us to assess our ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements by requiring us to provide financial assistance to the Bank in the event of financial distress.  If we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the Dodd-Frank Act, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the FDIC, as appropriate, and entitled to a priority of payment. In addition, the FDIC provides that any insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or any assistance provided by the FDIC to, a commonly controlled insured depository institution. The Bank is an FDIC-insured depository institution and thus subject to these requirements.",

        "Acquisitions. The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve or waiver of such prior approval before it (1) acquires ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, such bank holding company will own or control more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares of such bank, (2) acquires all of the assets of a bank, or (3) merges with any other bank holding company. In reviewing a proposed covered acquisition, among other factors, the Federal Reserve considers (1) the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including performance under the CRA; and (4) the effectiveness of the companies in combatting money laundering. The Federal Reserve also reviews any indebtedness to be incurred by a bank holding company in connection with a proposed acquisition to ensure that the bank holding company can service such indebtedness without adversely affecting its ability to serve as a source of strength to its bank subsidiaries. Well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies are permitted to acquire control of banks in any state, subject to federal regulatory approval, without regard to whether such a transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. However, a bank holding company may not, following an interstate acquisition, control more than 10% of nationwide insured deposits or 30% of deposits within any state in which the acquiring bank operates.

        "Change in Control.  Federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person (including an entity) may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to and obtain approval from the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as Southern National. The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a person or group acquires the power to vote 10% or more of our outstanding common stock. The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation.

The following discussion summarizes the two Virginia statutes that may discourage an attempt to acquire control of Southern National.",
        "Virginia Code Sections 13.1-725 – 727.1 govern “Affiliated Transactions.” These provisions, with several exceptions discussed below, require approval by the holders of at least two-thirds of the remaining voting shares of material acquisition transactions between a Virginia corporation and any holder of more than 10% of any class of its outstanding voting shares. Affiliated Transactions include mergers, share exchanges, material dispositions of corporate assets not in the ordinary course of business, any dissolution of the corporation proposed by or on behalf of an interested shareholder, or any reclassification, including a reverse stock split, recapitalization, or merger of the corporation with its subsidiaries which increases the percentage of voting shares owned beneficially by any 10% shareholder by more than 5%.",
        "These provisions were designed to deter certain takeovers of Virginia corporations. In addition, the statute provides that, by affirmative vote of a majority of the voting shares other than shares owned by any 10% shareholder, a corporation can adopt an amendment to its articles of incorporation or bylaws providing that the Affiliated Transactions provisions shall not apply to the corporation. Southern National “opted out” of the Affiliated Transactions provisions when it incorporated.",
        "Virginia law also provides that shares acquired in a transaction that would cause the acquiring person’s voting strength to meet or exceed any of the three thresholds (20%, 33.33% or 50%) have no voting rights for those shares exceeding that threshold, unless granted by a majority vote of shares not owned by the acquiring person. This provision empowers an acquiring person to require the Virginia corporation to hold a special meeting of shareholders to consider the matter within 50 days of the request. Southern National also “opted out” of this provision at the time of its incorporation.",
        "Governance and Financial Reporting Obligations. We are required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and NASDAQ.

The federal banking agencies issued proposed rules in 2011 and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies.

The required capital ratios are minimums, and the federal banking agencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on our capital levels.",
        "Southern National and the Bank are each subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a common equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total risk-based capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.  CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, plus retained earnings and certain qualifying minority interests, less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt, other preferred stock and certain hybrid capital instruments, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, certain “high volatility” commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings. ",
        "The leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average total consolidated assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. The required minimum leverage ratio for all banks is 4%.",
        "In addition, effective January 1, 2019, the capital rules require a capital conservation buffer of CET1 of 2.5% above each of the minimum capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital), which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. These buffer requirements must be met for a bank or bank holding company to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without restriction. ",
        "The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: “well capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized”, and “critically undercapitalized”. A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository ",
        "17",

        "institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified.  ",
        "To be well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios:",
        "​",
        "​",
        "The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the current capital rules. For purposes of the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y, bank holding companies, such as Southern National, must maintain a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater to be well-capitalized. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a similar well-capitalized standard to bank holding companies as that applicable to the Bank, Southern National’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. Also, the Federal Reserve may require bank holding companies, including Southern National, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company’s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.",
        "Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on Southern National’s or the Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth.",
        "Both Southern National and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were above the applicable well-capitalized standards and met the capital conservation buffer as of December 31, 2020. Based on current estimates, we believe that Southern National and the Bank will continue to exceed all applicable well-capitalized regulatory capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer in 2021.   ",
        "On October 29, 2019, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule to simplify the regulatory capital requirements for eligible banks and holding companies with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets that opt into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (“CBLR”) framework. A qualifying community banking organization with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion that exceeds the CBLR threshold would be exempt from the agencies’ current capital framework, including the risk-based capital requirements and capital conservation buffer described above, and would be deemed well-capitalized under the agencies’ prompt corrective action regulations. Under the final rule, if a qualifying community banking organization elects to use the CBLR framework, it will be considered “well-capitalized” so long as its CBLR is greater than 9%. Southern National does not use the CBLR framework. ",
        "In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which introduced CECL as the methodology to replace the current “incurred loss” methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost, and changed the approaches for recognizing and recording credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased credit impaired financial assets. Under the incurred loss methodology, credit losses are recognized only when the losses are probable or have been incurred; under CECL, companies are required to recognize the full amount of expected credit losses for the lifetime of the financial assets, based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This change results in earlier recognition of credit losses that the Company deems expected but not yet probable. For SEC reporting companies that do not meet the definition of a smaller reporting company and with December 31 calendar year ends, such as the Company, CECL became effective January 1, 2020. The CARES Act allowed us to delay implementation until December 31, 2020. ",

        "Southern National is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and other subsidiaries.  Its primary source of cash, other than securities offerings, is dividends from the Bank. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, no dividends may be paid by an insured bank if the bank is in arrears in the payment of any insurance assessment due to the FDIC.  The payment of dividends by the Bank may also be affected by other regulatory requirements and policies, such as the maintenance of adequate capital. If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in, or is about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. The Federal Reserve has formal and informal policies which provide that insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.",
        "​",
        "Under a Federal Reserve policy adopted in 2009, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider certain factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position, and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios, such as potential events that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if: ",

        "The operation of the Bank is subject to state and federal statutes applicable to state banks and the regulations of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The operations of the Bank may also be subject to applicable Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) regulation to the extent state banks are granted parity with national banks. Such statutes and regulations relate to, among other things, required reserves, investments, loans, mergers and consolidations, issuances of securities, payments of dividends, establishment of branches, consumer protection and other aspects of the Bank’s operations. Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in these agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions.  Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company.",
        "​",
        "Safety and Soundness.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal prudential bank regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Reserve, to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (1) internal controls; (2) information systems and audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; and (6) asset quality. The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees and benefits. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.",

        "Consumer Protection. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, an independent regulatory authority housed within the Federal Reserve having centralized authority, including examination and enforcement authority, for consumer protection in the banking industry.  The CFPB has rule writing, examination, and enforcement authority with regard to the Bank’s (and Southern National’s) compliance with a wide array of consumer financial protection laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (except Sections 615(e) and 628), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (sections 502 through 509 relating to privacy), among others. The CFPB has broad authority to enforce a prohibition on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. Authority to supervise and examine Southern National and the Bank for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with the Federal Reserve. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB against certain institutions.",

        "Deposit Insurance Assessments. The Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC insures the deposits of the Bank generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.  The FDIC charges insured depository institutions quarterly premiums to maintain the DIF.  Deposit insurance assessments are based on average total consolidated assets minus its average tangible equity, and take into account certain risk-based financial ratios and other factors. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. ",

        "Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including those of the parent bank holding company.",

        "Anti-Money Laundering.  A continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act broadened the application of anti-money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as broker-dealers, investment advisors and insurance companies, and strengthened the ability of the U.S. Government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal provisions of Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act require that regulated financial institutions, including state member banks: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components; (ii) comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account; (iii) take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned accounts; and (iv) perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act’s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. Sonabank has augmented its systems and procedures to meet the requirements of these regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures and controls to reflect changes required by law.

        "Privacy and Cybersecurity.  The Bank is subject to federal and state banking regulations that limit its ability to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require us to periodically disclose our privacy policies to consumers and allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party under certain circumstances. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Banking institutions are required to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. These security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of confidential and personal information are in effect across our lines of business. Furthermore, the federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management. A financial institution is expected to implement multiple lines of defense against cyber-attacks and ensure that their risk management procedures address the risk posed by potential cyber threats. A financial institution is further expected to maintain procedures to effectively respond to a cyber-attack and resume operations following any such attack. Southern National has adopted and implemented policies and procedures to comply with these privacy, information security, and cybersecurity requirements. On December 18, 2020, the federal banking agencies proposed a new rule that would require banks to notify their regulators within 36 hours of a “computer-security incident” that rises to the level of a “notification incident.” ",

Independent auditors must receive examination reports, supervisory agreements and reports of enforcement actions. For insured institutions with total assets of $1.0 billion or more, financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management’s certifications concerning responsibility for the financial statements, internal controls and compliance with legal requirements designated by the FDIC, and an attestation by the independent auditor regarding the statements of management relating to the internal controls must be submitted. For insured institutions with total assets of more than $3.0 billion, independent auditors may be required to review quarterly financial statements. The FDICIA requires that institutions with total assets of $1.0 billion or more have independent audit committees, consisting of outside directors only. The committees of insured institutions with total assets of $3.0 billion or more must include members with experience in banking or financial management, must have access to outside counsel, and must not include representatives of large customers.",

        "At Brookdale, we are dedicated to enriching the lives of those we serve with compassion, respect, excellence, and integrity. We know that our success is dependent on attracting, engaging, developing, and retaining the best associates. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 45,000 associates, 70% of which were full time. Approximately 900 associates work in or through our Brentwood, Tennessee headquarters and Milwaukee, Wisconsin office, supporting our community- and agency-based associates.",
        "Our Culture",
        "We promote a culture based on servant leadership, where we believe purpose-driven work allows each of us to have a positive impact on the residents, patients, and associates we interact with every day. Our 2020 associate engagement survey showed that 93% of respondents know how they contribute to our success and 95% have a good understanding of our mission, vision, and cornerstones of passion, courage, partnership, and trust. We hire associates who we believe make serving seniors their calling, do what is right even when no one is watching, connect with fellow associates and our residents and patients, and treat one another with respect. ",
        "19",
        "Inclusion and Diversity",
        "We are a business of people taking care of people, where our associates do extraordinary things every day as part of their shared commitment to Brookdale’s cornerstones and mission. To attract and retain associates, we are committed to maintaining a welcoming and inclusive environment where people have an equal chance to grow and succeed. We support our associates by providing an open door policy, offering training to help our people grow and to understand our commitment to providing a workplace free from discrimination and harassment, consistently enforcing our policies, and maintaining the expectation that all our associates will be treated with dignity and respect.",
        "We also believe that true commitment to creating and fostering an inclusive and diverse workplace is best accomplished by example. Our Board of Directors has purposefully evolved its gender composition to more closely resemble our customer and employee base, of which the majority are women. Women now comprise 44% of our Board of Directors. Over the last two years, we also increased the diversity of our Board of Directors and executive leadership team. Two of the top three positions are held by women and 14% of our executive officers are racially or ethnically diverse. Our commitment to diversity is further reflected in our workforce. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 81% of our associates are women, who comprise approximately 73% of the leadership roles at our communities, agencies, and corporate offices, and approximately 53% of our associates and 12% of our leadership roles are people of color. Our commitment to developing, retaining, and promoting diverse talent and advancing our inclusion strategy is ongoing.",
        "Talent Acquisition, Development, and Retention:",
        "In order to attract people who want to do challenging yet rewarding work, we offer competitive wages and benefits as well as opportunities to grow a career at Brookdale through mentorship, education, and training opportunities. We use a variety of recruitment strategies to attract diverse talent to our organization, including partnerships with local and national organizations. In 2020, we established new nursing school partnerships in Jacksonville, Florida and Denver, Colorado to continue to strengthen our pipeline for caregiver and clinical roles. Additionally, we launched a new career section on our website to attract veterans and military spouses/partners to join Brookdale.",
        "We offer learning opportunities for our associates when they join Brookdale and throughout the year. Our newly implemented iLearn platform provides associates access to regulatory training, continuing education courses, and leadership and professional skill courses. We also offer a tuition reimbursement program for associates to continue to grow their career. To identify future leaders, we conduct strategic talent reviews regularly to provide senior leaders with visibility into succession for key leadership roles. ",
        "We believe the performance of individual communities is correlated to retention of our community leaders. Our Executive Director (ED) and Health and Wellness Director (HWD) combined annual retention at our same community portfolio has remained around 70%. ",
        "Total Rewards",
        "We consider offering a competitive total rewards program an important aspect of being an employer of choice. Both full-time and part-time associates may participate in our 401(k) retirement savings plan with an opportunity for a matching contribution, our associate stock purchase plan, and other benefit plans. We provide full-time associates additional benefits, including paid time off (\"PTO\") and holidays as well as adoption benefits. In 2020, over 50% of eligible full-time associates participated in our medical and dental insurance plans.",
        "We also recognize that there may be a time when associates need financial assistance due to extraordinary circumstances such as a fire, a tornado or hurricane, or the pandemic. Our Associate Compassion Fund provides this type of assistance for associates in need. In 2020, approximately $1.8 million of donations of PTO by our associates were provided directly to associates in need, approximately $0.3 million of which was donated by our senior leadership team to specifically support those associates affected by COVID-19.",

        "The transition of management or unexpected departure of our key officers could harm our business. ",
        "We are dependent on the efforts of our senior management. The transition of management, the unforeseen loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive leaders, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could, at least temporarily, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and be negatively perceived in the capital markets. ",
        "Increased competition for, or a shortage of, personnel, wage pressures resulting from increased competition, low unemployment levels, increased unemployment benefits, minimum wage increases, changes in overtime laws, and union activity may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flow.",
        "Our success depends on our ability to retain and attract qualified management and other personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of each of our communities. We compete with various healthcare service providers, other senior living providers, and hospitality and food services companies in retaining and attracting qualified personnel. Increased competition for, or a shortage of, nurses, or other personnel (including due to the pandemic), low levels of unemployment, increased unemployment benefits, or general inflationary pressures have required and may require in the future that we enhance our pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience wage pressures due to minimum wage increases mandated by state and local laws and the increase in the minimum salary threshold for overtime exemptions under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which the Department of Labor increased effective January 1, 2020. Changes to minimum wage laws may result in higher operating costs, and we may not be able to offset the added costs resulting from competitive, inflationary or regulatory pressures by increasing the rates we charge to our residents or our service charges, which would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flow. ",
        "Turnover rates of our personnel and the magnitude of the shortage of nurses or other personnel varies substantially from market to market. If we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, our ability to conduct our business operations effectively, our overall operating results, and cash flow could be harmed. ",
        "In addition, efforts by labor unions to unionize any of our community personnel could divert management attention, lead to increases in our labor costs, and/or reduce our flexibility with respect to certain workplace rules. If we experience an increase in organizing activity, if onerous collective bargaining agreement terms are imposed upon us, or if we otherwise experience an increase in our staffing and labor costs, our results of operations and cash flow would be negatively affected.

Our senior managers and directors have extensive experience in the forest products industry, and we have experienced managers at all of our mills.

Our pulp segment employs approximately 1,875 people and our wood products segment employs approximately 430 people. The majority of our employees in both segments are bound by collective agreements. We consider the relationships with our employees, and the unions which represent them, to be good. Strong labor management relations are fundamental to our operations. Accordingly, we recognize and work cooperatively with the unions to ensure we build and maintain superior working conditions, a supportive work environment, training and growth opportunities and fair compensation packages.

The industries in which we operate have their own particular set of risks including hazards from our complex industrial manufacturing facilities such as manufacturing processes, heavy and complex equipment, operating boilers, energy production, and the use and recovery of chemicals. Accordingly, there is no initiative that attracts a higher degree of focus for our management team than our “Road to Zero” program, which is a company-wide initiative to create safe and productive work environments with a goal of zero workplace incidents. ",
        "We have developed tools to analyze potential and incurred incidents and we have resources to develop prevention initiatives. In particular, we focus on modelling responses to eliminate the risk, where possible, by using the \"hierarchy of controls\" adopted by many of the world's leading health and safety organizations. Our priority is the elimination of hazards, followed by safe administrative practices and the appropriate personal protective equipment. We identify, monitor, educate, and take a data-driven approach to drive workplace safety improvements. Many of our programs revolve around education, hazard identification, and risk mitigation strategies. These proactive initiatives bring safety to the forefront of our work practices. Our teams of safety professionals are dedicated to finding and utilizing the right tools to prevent all workplace injuries. Our Chief Executive Officer is the Chair of our Senior Safety Leadership Committee, referred to as the \"SSLC\", which designs and implements broad policies, strategies, expenditures, and training for our employees. The SSLC has engaged a globally recognized safety consultant specializing in the design and implementation of health and safety management systems. Such advisors have been supporting the initiatives established by the SSLC and providing leadership training, policy implementation, and practical tools to support our employees. ",
        "We closely monitor the health and safety issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, we encouraged and supported remote-access initiatives so that key staff can work from home or from non-office locations; restricted business travel, based on guidance from the World Health Organization; provided alternative arrangements for site and staff meetings; provided safe working environments that include disinfection of work stations, increased cleaning by janitorial staff, separated shifts, limited staff gatherings in lunchrooms; and instituted social distancing and self-assessment opportunities, which were overseen by trained staff. Employees experiencing cold- or flu-like symptoms were prohibited from coming into the operations and were advised to seek medical attention in line with provincial and regional COVID-19 guidelines. From an operational standpoint, we aligned the work processes at our operating locations within the guidelines of relevant authorities and remained fully operational. A dedicated leadership team met daily to respond to evolving developments and to adjust our operations accordingly while ensuring the safety and health of our employees, contractors, customers, and partners.

All of our employees are provided competitive benefits packages that provide pension, medical, dental, and vision care benefits. Employees are also able to access specialized assistance such as physiotherapy, lifestyle, retirement planning, and family counselling services. We provide a deep mix of training to help our people grow and be more effective in their current and future roles. Our partnership with a global management institute in Switzerland provides company-focused management and strategic development training for our future leaders. ",

We continue to effect changes to our recruiting and training processes to make our workplaces even more reflective of the diversity that exists in our communities.",

Upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements, however, we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us, and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements. In addition, our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently. A work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our results of operations.",

        "History of Sterno ",
        "Sterno’s history dates back to 1893 when S. Sternau & Co. began making chafing dishes and coffee percolators in Tenafly, New Jersey.  In 1914, S. Sternau & Co. introduced “canned heat” with the launch of its gelled ethanol product under the “Sterno” brand.  Since then, the Sternau and Sterno names have been the most well-known names in portable food warming fuel.  In 1917, S. Sternau & Co. was renamed The Sterno Corporation.  During World War I, Sterno portable stoves were promoted as an essential gift for soldiers going to fight in the trenches of Europe.  Sterno stoves heated water and rations, sterilized surgical instruments, and provided light and warmth in bunkers and foxholes.  During World War II, Sterno produced ethanol and methanol chafing fuels under contract with the U.S. military.  Sterno's production facilities were moved from New Jersey to Texarkana, Texas in the early 1980s.  In 2012, Sterno merged with the Candle Lamp Company, LLC (\"CandleLamp\").  CandleLamp was founded in Riverside, California in 1978, focusing initially on the liquid wax candle market.  Over the next several decades, CandleLamp began to supply chafing fuel in addition to lighting products.  We purchased Sterno on October 10, 2014.",

At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the full year utilization rates of our delivery professionals were approximately 79.8%, 78.0%, and 78.1 %, respectively. We are continuously exploring new geographies and markets as sources of talent.",
        "EPAM invests significant resources in training and developing our employees through our learning and development programs. Our largest learning and development investment has been directed towards developing our engineering talent, including targeted training programs, innovation labs, and significant internal production projects. Our employees consumed over 1.6 million learning hours in 2020. We deliver learning opportunities and content through our unique learning ecosystem that promotes learning in the daily workflow to improve retention and productivity, and through dedicated events, including our week-long global learning event, which featured approximately 200 online sessions. We have also built relationships with laboratories and technical universities so our employees can be exposed to the current thinking in academia. We regularly host or participate in “hackathons” so our employees can build technical skills and foster communities around specific technologies and areas of interest. ",
        "We deliver learning and development content through proprietary platforms that make learning and development content easily available to all of our employees. Our digital learning platform provides our employees with an interface to meet our employees’ learning and training needs and includes a recommendation engine that suggests courses and materials based on employee role, level, location and skills. Our electronic library platform makes books and publications available to all of our employees and we celebrate learning achievements through our recognition portal, where we promote our employees’ learning accomplishments and employees can recognize each other for their teamwork, initiative, and unique, valuable skills.",

We believe that innovation comes from the unique perspectives, knowledge, and experiences of our global employees, so we strive to create an inclusive culture by offering comprehensive language learning programs and providing structured education in communication skills and cultural sensitivity and awareness. ",
        "Increasing diversity in executive and key operational leadership roles is an organizational priority that starts at the top of our organization. For example, women currently represent approximately 29% of the independent directors on our Board. We have developed programs, both within EPAM and externally, so we can continuously retain and supply a pipeline of qualified, diverse candidates to foster our goals. Our programs include dedicating resources and personnel in our talent acquisition team to identify, recognize, and use diverse and inclusive sources for hiring, including associating with organizations that are focused on promoting underrepresented groups in engineering, IT, and business. We also developed the Emerging Engineers Lab, an internship program for entry-level talent sourced from a variety of diverse technology programs across the U.S. Participants who successfully complete the paid training program are ready to engage on billable customer engagements with the rest of our delivery professionals. We also supplemented our mandatory annual training with materials geared towards eliminating unconscious bias in our professional interactions.",
        "Our employees have driven the creation of discussion forums focused on diversity and inclusion topics important to them and organized participation in global and local events, including International Women’s Day and Pride celebrations. Recognizing that improving the number of underrepresented people in the software and technology industries starts with access to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (“STEM”) education, EPAM has associated with technical universities in our largest employee population geographies to bolster post-secondary STEM education. We also created the EPAM E-KIDS program where our employees volunteer their time to teach elementary school age children of any gender, race, or ethnic identity STEM concepts and introductory software coding skills. As of the end of 2020, we offered the EPAM E-KIDS program in 13 countries.  ",
        "Employee Engagement and Retention:",
        " We are committed to respecting our employees' fundamental human rights at work and accordingly are a participant in the United Nations Global Compact. We believe that retaining skilled talent requires substantially more than meeting basic employment and labor rights, and that employees who are fairly compensated, feel supported in their career development, and are engaged with their employer are more likely to remain with that employer. That is why we strive to provide pay and benefits that demonstrate the value of our employees to us, including a competitive salary, flexible work-life balance, paid time off, health coverage, ongoing training programs, relocation options, and recognition opportunities for open source software contributions.

These programs are housed in proprietary platforms that provide our employees with a framework for the skill development they will need to build their career path, identify skill gaps, and set professional development goals. We designed our career development programs to enable our employees to develop the best engineering practices and influence engineering culture, develop thought leadership in technical and strategic skills, and introduce them to leaders in the field at our industry conferences. Our career development programs also give our employees opportunities to earn accreditation and relevant expertise in various technology fields, including software and project management certifications and recognition and credentialing from the industry’s primary software and cloud services providers.  ",
        "EPAM focuses on retaining and engaging top talent by focusing on hiring people with the skill sets our customers need and who also fit our values so we can build long-term employee satisfaction. We endeavor to recruit for careers, not for short-term projects, and actively foster feedback from our employees so we can improve the EPAM employee experience, identify opportunities to strengthen our culture and improve retention, and help our people develop their careers. We believe our ability to effectively hire, engage, and retain high-skilled personnel is a principal competitive factor in our business, which is evidenced by our 2020 voluntary attrition rate of 10.8%, which decreased compared to our 2019 and 2018 voluntary attrition rate of 13.3 % and 14.8 %, respectively. Moreover, our employees have demonstrated their satisfaction with our approach by giving their highest ratings in our 2020 annual employee survey to the following areas: trust in management (93.4/100), good working environment (93.0/100), cooperation between teams (89.8/100), and employee contribution to EPAM’s success (89.6/100). Receiving and responding to employee feedback plays a critical role in engaging and retaining our employees because it offers us an opportunity to improve our operations and for our employees to continually enhance their skills.

        "Over the year, we developed further plans to help employees improve their mental fitness and resilience, including access to themed training and resources, provision of bespoke management training, global expansion of our Wellbeing Ambassadors program, and launch of a new mobile application providing employees with 24/7 access to a personalized mental health and wellbeing platform, which we expect to formally launch in 2021.

        "Hiring the Best and Brightest ",
        "In 2020, we hired over 8,000 new employees, the majority of whom were appointed utilizing innovative virtual selection processes during the COVID-19 pandemic through proactive promotion of our employer brand using social media, supplemented by targeted campaigns for specialist expertise, with a particular focus on sourcing diverse applicants to reflect the communities in which we operate.  ",
        "Our onboarding process helps new hires quickly become effective and develop a strong sense of belonging, equipped with the right tools and support to enable them to perform.  With virtual onboarding a new reality, we have enhanced our processes to include digital welcome packs which promote our employee-centric culture.  ",
        "During 2020, we began to refresh our Employee Value Proposition (\"EVP\"), putting purpose at the heart of our employer brand.  KBR offers fulfilling careers to the best and brightest people, and we empower our employees to work in ways that work for them.  We are researching how our internal and external perceptions match up to that promise, which will inform how we articulate, promote and measure our employer brand in the future. ",
        "Inclusion & Diversity",
        "We established a new Inclusion & Diversity (\"I&D\") Council early in 2020, representing a cross-section of employees from different markets, businesses and functions, to review, assess and champion initiatives which support our inclusion and diversity journey.  We have set out a comprehensive I&D strategy with the goal of becoming a magnet for diverse talent, where we are known for a culture of belonging and equality, and adopted a program to inform our practices on hiring, developing, engaging and rewarding diverse talent.  The I&D Council’s first set of recommendations, which focused on hiring, training and education, are now being implemented through our global Human Resources (\"HR\") community and business leadership teams.",
        "15",
        "Women represented 23.4% of KBR’s workforce as of December 31, 2020, a slight increase from 22.6% as of December 31, 2019, and we continue to consider gender diversity in our recruiting and hiring process.  In 2020 we also conducted a systematic review of gender pay equity and monitored the gender balance among new hires and leavers, and were pleased to confirm we found no indication of bias in our reward structures or headcount trends.  ",
        "Moving forward, we are accelerating our focus on diversity into other areas, with a particular emphasis on race and ethnicity, and the I&D Council will be researching and recommending continual improvements in this important area.  The team will also be reviewing our internal targets and using data to track lead indicators and performance outcomes.",
        "Employee Resource Groups",
        "Over the year, we have continued to support and engage with our Employee Resource Groups (\"ERGs\"), which together form a valuable network across KBR to educate, advocate and connect people with common interests.  The primary ERG focused on I&D is ASPIRE, which has been an established employee network and support group for more than five years and conducts events across the world, regularly attended by hundreds of participants.  In 2020, a new Pride & Allies ERG was launched, and we also plan to provide ERG support for Working Parents and Caregivers.  Looking forward, we are planning to bring all our I&D related ERGs together under a global umbrella which supports all diverse populations and champions inclusion across KBR.",
        "For our early career professionals, we sponsor IMPACT, an ERG focused on talent development, which helps employees through networking, continuing education, and mutual support.  In 2020, we launched the IMPACT Vision Series of webinars, focused on the science, technology and engineering behind KBR’s strategy and solutions, with attendance typically over 800 for each event, and we plan to build on this momentum as we support the growth of IMPACT in 2021. ",
        "Talent Development & Succession",
        "As part of our overall talent development strategy we continue to focus on succession planning for critical roles, including the Executive Leadership Team and Chief Executive Officer, and engage regularly with the Board on these topics.  In addition to identifying potential successors, in 2020 we also introduced a robust talent review process, which calibrates performance and potential for our leadership team and ensures appropriate action plans are in place to prepare our next level of talent for the challenges and opportunities ahead.  We have plans in place to cascade this talent calibration process to the next level during 2021, bringing greater visibility and breadth to succession planning for other key roles.",
        "KBR provides targeted learning and development opportunities, such as our Global Leadership Development Program, through which nominees develop their strategic thinking and executive leadership skills.  The current participants in this program have undertaken a range of challenging business projects during 2020, alongside skills development, coaching and networking events.  ",
        "In addition to such tailored programs and processes, all KBR employees can participate in a wide range of learning and development activities.  Our learning management system provides access to thousands of modules, podcasts, articles and videos, spanning technical, behavioral and regulatory training requirements.  ",
        "Employee Engagement",
        "We evaluate our success in making KBR a great place to work, in part, by whether our employees choose to stay with us, and in 2020 we were pleased to note a reduction in voluntary turnover.  While we are confident that this reflects our ongoing efforts to increase employee engagement, we recognize that the reduction is also due to labor market dynamics, and in particular the uncertainty caused by COVID-19.  ",
        "We closely monitor our employees’ engagement and satisfaction, undertaking pulse surveys and routinely conducting exit interviews to learn from their experience.  During 2020, we began crowdsourcing real-time feedback from employees using digital polling platforms as part of our virtual events, which helped generate honest, anonymous feedback and ideas on a wide range of topics related to their experience as employees as well as our business overall.  ",
        "As we refresh our EVP, we plan to build on our local survey processes and establish a global employee survey, which will also encapsulate feedback on inclusion and diversity, mental health and wellbeing, and our One KBR Values.  This will be a fundamental building block to help us hire great people that can do great things that matter to the world.",

We shifted from existing flexible working arrangements to working from home on a regular basis, using digital platforms and virtual collaboration tools to maintain productivity and to remain in contact with one another and our business partners and customers. In addition, we have also limited travel to further support and protect our employees. In April 2020, in light of the disruption and uncertainty created by the global COVID-19 pandemic and resulting impact on business conditions, and in order to avoid reducing our global workforce, we enacted a salary reduction to employees (including management) across the organization. At the time, we combined this with a one-time equity grant to our employees equal to the annualized amount of the salary reduction in order to retain and motivate them and to let our employees know that we are doing everything we can as a company to support them during these unprecedented times. As the momentum of the business improved throughout 2020, the salary reductions were recouped to the original salary pre-reduction in two phases. Additionally, in response to the pandemic, we provided our employees a work-from-home equipment allowance in order to allow them to continue effectively working remotely. Moreover, we enhanced and promoted programs to support our employees' physical and mental well-being.

        "Our business requires intensive sales and marketing activities. Our sales and marketing personnel are essential to attracting new customers and expanding sales to existing customers, both of which are key to our future growth. We face a number of challenges in successfully expanding our sales force. Our transition to a subscription-based model, and the additional demands involved in selling multiple products, has increased the complexity and to some extent impose new challenges in finding, hiring and retaining qualified sales force members. We must locate and hire a significant number of qualified individuals, and competition for such individuals is intense. In addition, as we expand into new markets with which we have less familiarity and develop existing territories, we will need to recruit individuals who have skills particular to a certain geography or territory, and it may be difficult to find candidates with those qualifications. We may be unable to achieve our hiring or integration goals due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the challenge in remotely recruiting employees and adequately training them due to COVID-19, the number of individuals we hire, challenges in finding individuals with the correct background due to increased competition for such hires, increased attrition rates among new hires and existing personnel as well as the necessary experience to sell our Data Security Platform rather than individual software products. Furthermore, based on our past experience in mature territories, it often can take up to 12 months before a new sales force member is trained and operating at a level that meets our expectations, and during the COVID-19 pandemic such training may take even longer. We invest significant time and resources in training new members of our sales force, and we may be unable to achieve our target performance levels with new sales personnel as rapidly as we have done in the past, or at all, due to larger numbers of hires or lack of experience training sales personnel to operate in new jurisdictions or because of the remote hiring and training process. Our failure to hire a sufficient number of qualified individuals, to integrate new sales force members within the time periods we have achieved historically or to keep our attrition rates at levels comparable to others in our industry may materially impact our projected growth rate.",

        "Our future success and growth depend, in part, on our ability to continue to recruit and retain highly skilled personnel and to preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture. Because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products, we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain engineers. Any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time, and we face intense competition for highly skilled employees. Competition for qualified employees, particularly in Israel, where we have a substantial presence and need for qualified engineers, from numerous other companies, including other software and technology companies, many of whom have greater financial and other resources than we do, is intense. Moreover, to the extent we hire personnel from other companies, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or may have divulged proprietary or other confidential information to us. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is characterized as an unstable period, to some extent it may be more difficult to timely attract and train new employees. If we are unable to timely attract, retain or train qualified employees, particularly our engineers, salespeople and key managers, our ability to innovate, introduce new products and compete would be adversely impacted, and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.  Equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs. If we reduce, modify or eliminate our equity programs or if there will be decline in our stock price as a result of which the value of our equity compensation shall be lower, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining employees.",

If enacted as drafted, the proposal requiring aggregation across associated funds could, absent exemptions for index-funds or certain types of registered funds, substantially increase BlackRock’s pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds’ ability to trade freely, require the implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests.

        "2020 was truly an unprecedented year. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our global employee population transitioned to working remotely overnight. With that change came many challenges for our employees that required us to increase our support programs. To help our employees with the change and uncertainty we implemented a childcare reimbursement program and provided technology and office equipment reimbursements for our employees to set up ergonomically safe workspaces at home. We also increased our mental health offerings to provide face to face video sessions with licensed mental health experts for all employees. We provided flexible time off for employees to deal with the challenges facing them from childcare, schooling, mental health and overall wellness. We also increased our all employee communications to help employees feel connected in a new virtual world."

        "As of December 31, 2020, we had 360 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are good. We have long believed that the core to success lies in having a diverse and engaged workforce. In terms of diversity, we have focused both on gender and racial diversity. We recognized that change starts at the top and in 2020 we substantially changed the racial and gender profile of our Board of Directors (“Board”). Our Board chair is a woman and the majority of the Board consists of women and two of our seven Board members are black. With respect to our workforce, our Company consists of 59% women, including women in critical leadership positions. Our Chief People Officer is a woman of Asian descent and women run our Society6, Saatchi Art, and Well+Good business units. ",
        "While racial diversity has always been a priority, shortly following the start of the anti-racism movement and protests in 2020, we recognized that we needed to do more to address the pervasive issues of racial injustice.  In that regard, to further support our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (“DEI”), we hired our first Vice President of DEI and Talent Management to help ensure the DEI considerations were driven into every aspect of our business. We published our official DEI statement on our intranet and rolled out various resources to further educate our people and assist them in our efforts to accelerate our efforts to build a diverse workforce.   ",
        "While a small company, we work hard to implement a compensation system that both enables us to attract the type of talent we feel is necessary to help the Company succeed and that incentivizes the performance that we are seeking. We operate on a premise both of shared rewards and shared sacrifice. In terms of rewards, we provide competitive base salaries, bonuses, health and welfare benefits and a defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (“401(k) Plan”) covering all full-time employees who meet certain eligibility requirements.   In addition, we give eligible employees equity awards so that they can share in the success of our Company as our stock price improves and we also want them to think of themselves as owners of the business with the motivation that brings. In terms of shared sacrifice, in spring of 2020, when the Pandemic first hit, the management team with the full support of the Board was committed to avoiding layoffs and proceeded with a shared sacrifice model. The Board declined all compensation for the first half of 2020, our CEO took a 50% pay cut, our senior executives took a 25% cut and the rest of the employees took a 15% pay cut, which cuts in base pay were later restored.  We believe that this approach to shared sacrifice is consistent with our view that we treat our employees as partners in the growth of our business. ",

Social, Environmental, and Community Responsibility  Our mission to protect and enhance life applies not only to the products and services that we deliver, but also to how we are cognizant of our social and environmental responsibilities as well as serve the communities in which we live and work. Starting in 2012, we established a platform, that we call eGIVE (Give, Invest, Volunteer), that we have continued to expand since its inception.  Through this platform, we have encouraged employees to make contributions to select charitable organizations and volunteer their time, which we have supported with paid time off to support socially responsible activities. As our organization has grown, we have continually explored ways in which we can have impact at broader scale. To that end, in December 2020, we initiated a comprehensive enterprise-wide Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) project to understand our current and desired ESG profile, engage internal and external stakeholders in the ESG conversation, identify priority ESG action items and issue our maiden sustainability report focused on our ESG initiatives by the end of 2021, consistent with our corporate strategy and our commitment to the communities in which we operate.

The states in which we operate have adopted complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to access and rate discrimination.

        "The EP Act of 2005 is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans, and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, the EP Act of 2005 amends the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. The EP Act of 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties up to a maximum amount that is adjusted annually for inflation, which for 2021 equals approximately $1.3 million per violation per day for violations of the NGA and approximately $1.3 million per violation per day for violations of the NGPA. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce as well as entities that are otherwise subject to the NGA or NGPA. In 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670 to implement the anti-market manipulation provision of the EP Act of 2005. Order No. 670 does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which includes the annual reporting requirements under a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (Order No. 704), and the quarterly reporting requirement under Order No. 735.

We have a concentration of our sales force in Arizona, but we also have a widely deployed field sales force. We have aligned our sales resources to improve our sales productivity and efficiency and to bring our sales personnel closer to our current and potential customers. Adjustments to our sales force have been and will continue to be expensive and could cause some near-term productivity impairments.

Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of inside and direct sales personnel. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take a significant period of time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. Our business will be seriously harmed if our sales force productivity efforts do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue.",

There is considerable competition for talented individuals with the specialized knowledge to deliver our services, and this competition affects our ability to hire and retain key employees. Historically, we have experienced a significant amount of employee turnover, especially with respect to our sales personnel. Sales personnel that are relatively new may need time to become fully productive. Inability to retain or hire key employees could disrupt our operations, delay the development and introduction of our services, and negatively impact our ability to sell our services.",

The expenses of defending these lawsuits, particularly fees paid to our lawyers and expert consultants, have been significant to date. If the cost of prosecuting or defending current or future lawsuits continues to be significant, it may continue to adversely affect our operating results during the pendency of such lawsuits.  Lawsuits also require a diversion of management and technical personnel time and attention away from other activities to pursue the defense or prosecution of such matters.  In addition, adverse rulings in such lawsuits either alone or cumulatively may have an adverse impact on our revenue, expenses, market share, reputation, liquidity, and financial condition.",

We have applied for patent protection in the United States and a number of foreign countries. These legal protections afford only limited protection and laws in foreign jurisdictions may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Monitoring infringement of our intellectual property rights is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights. Developments and changes in patent law, such as changes in interpretations of the joint infringement standard, could restrict how we enforce certain patents we hold. We also cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted, that any future patent will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us. If we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property rights, our business may be harmed.",
        "Internet-related and other laws relating to taxation issues, privacy, data security, and consumer protection and liability for content distributed over our network could harm our business.",
        "Laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce conducted over the Internet are becoming more prevalent, both in the United States and internationally, and may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online or providing Internet-related services such as ours. Increased regulation could negatively affect our business directly, as well as the businesses of our customers, which could reduce their demand for our services. For example, tax authorities abroad may impose taxes on the Internet-related revenue we generate based on where our internationally deployed servers are located. In addition, domestic and international taxation laws are subject to change. Our services, or the businesses of our customers, may become subject to increased taxation, which could harm our financial results either directly or by forcing our customers to scale back their operations and use of our services in order to maintain their operations. Also, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the Act), and the regulations promulgated by the FCC under Title II of the Act, may impose obligations on the Internet and those participants involved in Internet-related businesses. In addition, the laws relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on, processed by or disseminated through their networks are unsettled, both in the United States and abroad. Network operators have been sued in the past, sometimes successfully, based on the content of material disseminated through their networks. We may become subject to legal claims such as defamation, invasion of privacy and copyright infringement in connection with content stored on or distributed through our network. In addition, our reputation could suffer as a result of our perceived association with the type of content that some of our customers deliver. If we need to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to the risks posed by laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce conducted over the Internet, or are required to defend ourselves against related claims, our financial results could be negatively affected.",
        "Several other laws also could expose us to liability and impose significant additional costs on us. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not eliminate, our liability for the delivery of customer content that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with certain statutory requirements. Also, the Children’s On-line Privacy Protection Act restricts the ability of online services to collect information from minors and the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances. There are also emerging regulation and standards regarding the collection and use of personal information and protecting the security of data on networks. Compliance with these laws, regulations, and standards is complex and any failure on our part to comply with these regulations may subject us to additional liabilities.",

GDPR specifically imposes strict rules regulating data transfers of personal data from the EU to the US. These laws and regulations are costly to comply with, could expose us to civil penalties and substantial penalties for non-compliance, as well as private rights of action for data breaches, all of which could increase our potential liability. This could also delay or impede the development or adoption of our products and services, reduce the overall demand for our services, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, slow the pace at which we close (or prevent us from closing) sales transactions. Furthermore, these laws have prompted a number of proposals for new US and global privacy legislation, which, if enacted, could add additional complexity and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources, and impact strategies and require changes in business practices and policies.",
        "We expect that we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our evolving efforts to comply with our obligations under privacy laws will be sufficient. If we are investigated by data protection regulators, we may face fines and other penalties.
