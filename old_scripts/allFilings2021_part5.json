As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. The FDIC also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against commercial institutions and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition.",

Currently, the FDIC’s base assessment rates are 3 to 30 basis points and are subject to certain adjustments. For institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, rates are determined based on supervisory ratings and certain financial ratios. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments, and any significant increases may have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Company.

The Bank applied the $282,000 small bank credits received to its quarterly deposit insurance assessments paid during 2019, reducing the Bank’s FDIC expense for the year to $307,000.

        "The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to: internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution’s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program also must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information. Each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems. If the FDIC determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines, it may require an institution to submit to the FDIC an ",

        "Capital Requirements. ",
        "Federally insured financial institutions, such as First Financial Northwest Bank, and their holding companies, are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital. ",
        "First Financial Northwest Bank is subject to capital regulations adopted by the FDIC, which establish minimum required ratios for common equity Tier 1 capital (“CET1”), Tier 1 capital and total capital, and the leverage ratio; set out risk-weights for assets and certain off-balance sheet items for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, require an additional capital conservation buffer over the minimum risk-based ratios’ and define what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to subsidiary banks generally apply to bank holding companies.  However, the Federal Reserve Board has provided a “Small Bank Holding Company” exception to its consolidated capital requirements, and bank holding companies with less than $3.0 billion of consolidated assets are not subject to the consolidated holding company capital requirements unless otherwise directed by the Federal Reserve Board. ",
        "Under the capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) unless an institution has elected to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital, and certain minority interests, all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain conditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.",
        "Mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes AOCI, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities",

        "However, because of our asset size, we were eligible for the one-time option of permanently opting out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in our capital calculations. We elected this option in the first quarter of 2015.",
        "For purposes of determining risk-based capital, assets and certain off-balance sheet items are risk-weighted from 0% to 1,250%, depending on the risk characteristics of the asset or item. These risk weights include, for example, a 150% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non‑residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; and a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable.",
        "In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1, and total capital ratios, the capital regulations require a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses.",
        " ",
        "To be considered “well capitalized,” a depository institution must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.5% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which its primary federal banking regulator requires it to maintain a specific capital level. As of December 31, 2020, First Financial Northwest Bank met the requirements to be “well capitalized” and met the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement. ",
        "The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”), enacted in May 2018, required the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, to establish for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8 to 10%.  Institutions with capital meeting or exceeding the ratio and otherwise complying with the specified requirements (including off-balance sheet exposures of 25% or less of total assets and trading assets and liabilities of 5% or less of total assets) and electing the alternative framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements.  The community bank leverage ratio was established at 9% Tier 1 capital to total average assets, effective January 1, 2020.  A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report.  An institution that temporarily ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two- quarter grace period to again achieve compliance.  Failure to meet the qualifying criteria within the grace period or maintain a leverage ratio of 8% or greater requires the institution to comply with the generally applicable capital requirements.

This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the current method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowances as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required under CECL. For a banking organization, implementation of CECL is generally likely to reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital.",

A bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve’s regulations or both. No regulations have yet been proposed by the Federal Reserve to implement the source of strength provisions required by the Dodd-Frank Act. First Financial Northwest and any subsidiaries that it may control are considered “affiliates” within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between First Financial Northwest Bank and affiliates are subject to numerous restrictions. With some exceptions, First Financial Northwest and its subsidiaries are prohibited from tying the provision of various services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by First Financial Northwest or by its affiliates.",

        "The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\"CERCLA\") governs the cleanup of inactive hazardous waste sites and imposes liability for the cleanup on “responsible parties” generating or transporting waste to a site. CERCLA further provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA to releases of hazardous substances into the environment and authorizes the government to respond to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances or to order responsible persons to perform any necessary cleanup. CERCLA imposes strict liability on current or former owners and operators of facilities that release hazardous substances into the environment as well as on businesses that generate those substances or transport them to the facilities. Responsible parties may be liable for substantial investigation and cleanup costs even if they operated their businesses properly and complied with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and several. Certain of our customers' and third-party contractors' facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, the operators of these facilities may have generated, used, handled, and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes or other hazardous substances. Environmental liabilities could therefore exist under CERCLA, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or off-site locations where materials from our operations were disposed. In the past, we have been involved as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) at CERCLA cleanup sites, and it is possible that we may be involved at similar cleanup sites in the future.",
        "In addition to regulations under RCRA and CERCLA, the EPA has adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act (\"CAA\") and the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"). The CAA regulates emissions of pollutants into the air from mobile and stationary sources. CAA permits limit the emissions from parts cleaning units. One of our distribution hubs, our used oil re-refinery, and several of our oily water treatment operations are subject to facility-based permits under the CAA. The used oil re-refinery was constructed and is operating under CAA New Source Performance Standards and an associated permit. This air permit was modified to accommodate the expansion of the re-refinery. Our transportation fleet of trucks is regulated for emissions as mobile sources. Regulations under the CWA govern the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and sewers and require discharge permits and sampling and monitoring requirements. The CWA also requires specific spill plans governing the storage of waste and product hydrocarbons. A more detailed spill plan is also required at the used oil re-refinery because of the large volume of certain storage tanks. All of our recycling, used oil and oily water processing facilities currently hold CWA National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (\"NPDES\") permits for stormwater runoff and water pollution prevention. Our operations are also regulated pursuant to state statutes and implementing regulations, including those addressing clean water and clean air. ",

Governmental regulations apply to the vehicles used by us to transport the chemicals we distribute to customers and the waste and other residuals collected from customers.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the effective date for the aforementioned revision was delayed until December 1, 2021, Based on this revision, we will no longer be able to use either of our two standard solvents currently used in our parts cleaning services offered in the State of New York.

These legal and regulatory mandates have been instrumental in shaping the parts cleaning industry. We have developed methods of managing solvent as non-hazardous so as to significantly reduce the regulatory burden on us and on our customers. Any changes to, relaxation of, or repeal of federal or state laws and regulations affecting the parts cleaning industry may significantly affect the demand for our products as well as our competitive position in the market.

Although used oil is not classified as a hazardous waste under federal law, certain states do regulate used oil as state-regulated waste. Our used oil collection services require compliance with both federal and state regulations. As with our parts cleaning services, we make use of various programs to reduce the administrative burden associated with our customers' compliance with used oil regulations. Any used oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (\"PCBs\") is regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act (\"TSCA\"). The rules set minimum requirements for storage, treatment, and disposal of PCB wastes. Used oil contaminated with a certain level of PCBs may require incineration or special TSCA authorization or permits. The EPA has recently proposed CAA regulations requiring more stringent air permits governing the burning of certain recyclable materials, including non-specification used oil. We do not anticipate any negative impacts to the Company from this pending court ordered regulation. ",

State Departments of Transportation may regulate the characteristics of materials that are used as ingredients in roadway asphalt. A number of states have banned the use of VTAE as an ingredient in asphalt used on roadways. We believe, when used in the proper proportion, the VTAE produced at our re-refinery can be used in a paving asphalt formulation that meets all relevant performance standards. Regulatory restrictions on the use of VTAE have negatively impacted the marketability of this product and the profitability of our oil business. ",

Both Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company (\"CwA\") and First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance Company (\"FAFLIC\") are organized and domiciled in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; Accordia Life and Annuity Company (\"Accordia\") is organized and domiciled in the State of Iowa; and Forethought Life Insurance Company (\"FLIC\") is organized and domiciled in the State of Indiana (together, these four companies constitute Global Atlantic's \"U.S. insurance subsidiaries\"). Additionally, Global Atlantic's U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact insurance business in, and are subject to regulation and supervision by, all 50 states of the United States and the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
        "State insurance authorities have broad administrative powers over each of Global Atlantic's U.S. insurance subsidiaries with respect to all aspects of the insurance business. As part of their routine regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records, accounts and operations of insurance companies that are domiciled in their states. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other, non-domiciliary states under guidelines promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the \"NAIC\"). State insurance departments also regularly conduct regulatory inquiries of the insurance companies licensed in their states. ",
        "Global Atlantic also has special purpose financial captive insurance company subsidiaries domiciled in Vermont and Iowa that provide reinsurance to Accordia in order to facilitate the financing of redundant reserve requirements associated with the application of the NAIC Model Regulation entitled \"Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation\" (\"Regulation XXX\") and NAIC Actuarial Guideline XXXVIII (\"AG38\"). The application of both Regulation XXX and AG38 requires Global Atlantic to maintain statutory reserves which may be in excess of reserves required under GAAP.  ",
        "The rates, policy terms, and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject to regulation by any regulatory authority. However, the ability of a primary insurer to take credit for the reinsurance purchased from reinsurance companies is a significant component of reinsurance regulation. Typically, a primary insurer will only enter into a reinsurance agreement if it can obtain credit against its reserves on its statutory basis financial statements for the reinsurance ceded to the reinsurer. ",
        "Global Atlantic's U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends. Any proposed dividend in excess of the amount permitted by law is considered an \"extraordinary dividend or distribution\" and may not be paid until it has been approved, or a 30-day waiting period has passed during which it has not been disapproved, by the commissioner of the applicable domiciliary state of the U.S. insurance subsidiary. Due to losses incurred during the years before FAFLIC was a part of Global Atlantic, FAFLIC currently has a negative unassigned surplus. While the negative unassigned surplus is outstanding, FAFLIC must obtain written approval from the Massachusetts Division of Insurance prior to the payment of any dividend or distribution. None of Global Atlantic’s special purpose financial captive insurance company subsidiaries may declare or pay dividends or distributions in any form to us other than in accordance with its transaction agreements and governing licensing order.

        "State insurance holding company laws and regulations generally provide that no person, corporation or other entity may acquire control of an insurance company, or a controlling interest in any parent company of an insurance company, without the prior approval of such insurance company's domiciliary state insurance regulator. Under the laws of each of Global Atlantic's U.S. insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary states, acquiring, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered to have acquired control of the insurer, although such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not in fact exist.",
        "Finally, while the United States federal government in most contexts currently does not directly regulate the insurance business, the Federal Insurance Office (the \"FIO\") established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") now has an oversight role in respect to insurance regulation.",

For 2020, we achieved an overall recordable rate of 1.53, meaning that for every 100 employees, 1.53 employees incurred an injury that resulted in recordable medical treatment and the number of lost work days was 0.28, meaning that for every 100 employees, 0.28 individuals experienced an incident that resulted in days away from work.",

Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution. These permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. In addition, certain of our products and our customer’s products are subject to certification requirements by a variety of regulatory bodies. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all material environmental laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations.

        "Increasing global efforts to control emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrogen oxide and other greenhouse gases and pollutants, as well as the shifting focus of regulatory efforts towards total emissions output, have the potential to impact our facilities, costs, products and customers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has taken action to control greenhouse gases from certain stationary and mobile sources. In addition, several states have taken steps, such as adoption of cap and trade programs or other regulatory systems, to address greenhouse gases. There have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases. These developments and further actions that may be taken in the U.S. and in other countries, states or provinces could affect our operations both positively and negatively (e.g., by affecting the demand for or suitability of some of our products).",

Such liability may be joint and several so that we may be liable for more than our share of any contamination, and any such liability may be determined without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. We or our predecessors have been named potentially responsible parties at contaminated sites from time to time. We do not anticipate our liabilities relating to contaminated sites will be material to our financial results."

        "We performed an assessment on a lender by lender basis to identify certain lenders that met the criteria for troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) under ASC 470-60, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Debtors (“ASC 470-60”) as we were experiencing financial difficulties and the lenders granted us a concession. The portion of the loans that did not meet the assessment of TDR under ASC 470-60 were treated as modifications. We accounted for the exchange of approximately $1,782.5 million principal amount of our Existing Senior Subordinated Notes for approximately $1,289.1 million principal amount of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 as TDR. We accounted for the exchange of the remaining approximately $235.0 million principal amount of our Existing Senior Subordinated Notes for approximately $173.2 million principal amount of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 as a modification of debt as the lenders did not grant a concession and the difference between the present value of the old and new cash flows was less than 10%. The TDR and modification did not result in a gain recognition and we established new effective interest rates based on the carrying value of the Existing Subordinated Notes and recorded the new fees paid to third parties of approximately $36.3 million and $39.1 million in other expense, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.

Accordingly, the Company has entered into additional landlord negotiations to seek material reductions, abatements and deferrals in our rent obligations. In connection with these negotiations, we have ceased to make rent payments under a portion of our leases and have received notices of default, the result of which may permit landlords to threaten or seek a variety of remedies. We continue to renegotiate leases with landlords to attain additional concessions and address any instances of default. To the extent we achieve substantial deferrals but not abatements, our cash requirements will increase substantially in the future.",
        ". While the liquidity we have raised has substantially extended our liquidity runway, the new debt we have issued or that has been committed, together with the higher interest rate payments that will be required in the future but have largely been deferred, will substantially increase our leverage and future cash requirements. These future cash requirements, like our deferred rent obligations, will present a challenge to our long-term viability if our operating income does not return to pre-COVID levels. Even then, we believe we will need to engage in discussions with our creditors to substantially reduce our leverage. We expect to continue to explore alternatives that include new-money financing, potentially in connection with converting debt to equity, which would help manage our leverage but would be dilutive to holders of our common stock. We expect we will continue to receive from and discuss proposals with all classes of creditors. These discussions may not result in any agreement on commercially acceptable terms.",

Depending on our assumptions regarding the timing and ability to achieve more normalized levels of operating revenue, the estimates of amounts of required liquidity vary significantly. Similarly, it is very difficult to predict when theatre attendance levels will normalize, which we expect will depend on the widespread availability and use of effective vaccines for the coronavirus. However, our current cash burn rates are not sustainable. Further, we cannot predict what  future changes may occur to the supply or release date of movie titles available for theatrical exhibition once moviegoers are prepared to return in large numbers. Nor can we know with certainty the impact of Warner Bros.’s announcement that it is releasing its entire 2021 slate of movies on HBO Max at the same time as the movies debut in theatres or any similar announcements regarding the release of movie titles concurrently to the home video or streaming markets, as those arrangements will be subject to negotiations that have not yet taken place. We estimated future attendance levels and other assumptions to predict our liquidity requirements and future cash burn but our ability to accurately predict our liquidity and cash burn is uncertain due to the unknown magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, there can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in generating the additional liquidity necessary to meet its obligations beyond twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. If the Company is unable to maintain or renegotiate its minimum liquidity covenant requirements, it could have a significant adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results."

As an area of focus for Level One in 2020, Level One took a particular interest in the effect of societal turbulence on our minority team members and conducted an honest and sincere conversation about race relations with these team members. The team members then engaged in developing a path to enhance the engagement with Level One through further dialogue and programmatic support.",

Level One periodically reviews compensation and benefits by grade level and position to ensure similar positions are paid comparatively and to ensure that Level One has a competitive and valuable offering to meet the well-being and needs of its team members.",

Additionally, specially focused development plans were created for high potential and key talent to ensure learning through a variety of experiences. Level One also supports its team members’ involvement in external development programs. For example, each year, women are sponsored to attend the MBA Women’s Forum and others are supported through attendance in webinars and conferences.",
        "Team member turnover for 2020 was 13%. In 2020, Level One conducted its second enterprise-wide team member engagement survey with an 84% participation rate. Two councils representing team members from across the organization were formed to address the feedback.",

These core values are embedded in all team members’ performance reviews and talent discussions and are present in all interviews, selection decisions and promotions. The energy and dedication to Level One’s entrepreneurial spirit are driven by these core values and are evidenced by positive engagement survey results.",
        "COVID-19.",
        " In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, over 75% of Level One’s team members were able to work remotely. Level One also provided 10 days of paid time off for team members exposed to COVID-19 or who were diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the passing of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Level One adopted each of the provisions of the CARES Act relating to 401(k) loan and withdrawal relief and Level One participated in no-cost health care benefits pertaining to COVID-19 along with free telehealth visits. Level One did not reduce salaries or any other benefits during this time to support our team members through the pandemic."

During fiscal year 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees, and subcontractors and customers who work at, or visit, our facilities.  These protocols include complying with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities.  In addition, we modified the way we conduct many aspects of our business to reduce the number of in-person interactions.  For example, we significantly expanded the use of virtual interactions in all aspects of our business, including customer facing activities.  We have also implemented weekly COVID-19 testing which provide an added layer of trust and comfort for our employees."

We experienced a modest impact from the COVID-19 global pandemic during the first quarter of 2020, which became more pronounced beginning in the second quarter through the end of the year. We originally anticipated that our sales outside the United States would experience a greater proportional impact due to differences in the sales process in domestic versus international markets. Initially, the impact on our business was relatively consistent worldwide but we have since seen varying degrees of impact in international markets based on local conditions. We anticipate that our sales and operating results will continue to be adversely impacted and subject to unpredictable variability for the duration of the pandemic. For example, we have experienced delays in certain programs of up to three or six months from when they were originally planned, such as human factors studies associated with our product development efforts. In addition, regulatory timelines may be difficult to predict as the FDA has stated that its review process may take longer than normal due to the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our future business and operations is difficult to estimate and will depend on a number of factors including the scope and duration of the COVID-19 global pandemic and the relative impact of COVID-19 on the business operations of our contract manufacturers, suppliers, and competitors.",

To that end, we have increased the frequency of our communications to employees, suppliers, customers, and healthcare providers. Since March 2020, we have restricted non-essential employee travel, banned visitors from all of our facilities, and transitioned those employees able to perform their job function outside of our facilities to a remote work environment. For our field-based sales and clinical employees, we initially discontinued all in-person activities and began utilizing technology to remotely engage healthcare providers and customers. We continue to work closely with our healthcare providers and customers, remaining flexible in our method of interaction. To help ensure the safety and health of our employees in manufacturing and warehousing positions involved in production and fulfillment operations, we have implemented preventative measures to comply with social distancing requirements and require temperature checks of our employees before each shift.",

During the first six months of 2020, we experienced certain challenges managing our inventory, primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic. For example, in the first quarter of 2020, we observed customers purchasing cartridges and infusion sets at a higher rate than anticipated. In addition, during the second quarter of 2020, our infusion set manufacturer experienced certain inventory constraints which resulted in us requesting some customers to accept substitutions of similar products to prevent delays in order fulfillment. At this time, we believe many of our suppliers are deemed essential businesses under applicable governmental orders, and we have not experienced, and do not anticipate experiencing, disruption in our ability to manufacture insulin pumps and cartridges due to component procurement limitations. Additionally, our third-party cartridge manufacturer completed validation and commenced commercial-scale manufacturing near the end of the first quarter to supplement our existing cartridge manufacturing capacity, which we believe will assist us in meeting product demand in future periods. Our finished goods and raw material inventory, as well as available manufacturing capacity, position us well to respond to unforeseen disruptions in the near term.",

We are also leveraging our technology platforms, such as our t:connect diabetes management application, to support healthcare providers, as many of them are increasingly utilizing telehealth capabilities in their practices. By the end of the first quarter of 2020, we expanded our remote new pump training offering to all customers who purchased a t:slim X2 insulin pump, and in the third quarter, we resumed offering in-person trainings on a limited basis and under specific conditions."

While we align overall incentive payout with financial results, many employees are also incentivized on non-financial performance objectives and safety or operational efficiency goals or project objectives.

Many of these training modules include interactive training, so that trainees are engaged as they learn. We require employees to take certain modules on anti-harassment, anti-discrimination, legal compliance, safety and computer security at regular intervals. We provide additional training covering the company’s proprietary procedures and systems, product knowledge, leadership and management, sales skills, Microsoft Office 365 applications and a wide variety of IT areas. As we are increasing our digital capabilities through our MRCGOTM offering as well as other internal initiatives, we are increasing the development of employees to develop, implement, use and promote these digital platforms. In addition to modules on the Company’s LMS, we provide employees many opportunities to grow their product knowledge through targeted training that the Company, its suppliers or its customers present. We track all of our training, so that every employee has a training record and plan. Our on-boarding process for new employees provides a broad and accelerated understanding of MRC Global’s business and culture. Additionally, all employees establish development goals at the beginning of the year, and we track the progress of these goals through periodic individual development reviews.

We sell a number of products that reduce the emissions of gases. In particular, in 2020, 94% of our sales of valves were low-emission valves that control methane and other emissions. Many of the other valves that we sold were sold into applications such as the transfer of water that do not emit greenhouse gases or environmentally dangerous substances.",

Fluent received over 270 applications from businesses representing a diverse set of industries and objectives across North America, and five recipients each received $50,000 worth of digital marketing resources to support and accelerate business growth. We believe these service-based activities and donation matches help our employees stay engaged with and give back to their communities, and help them create real change.",

By codifying the Federal Reserve’s presumptions used in making control determinations, the final rule provides greater transparency on the types on relationships that the Federal Reserve generally views as supporting a facts-and-circumstances determination that one entity controls another. The final rule applies to questions of control under the BHCA, but does not extend to the Change in Bank Control Act. ",

In determining whether a particular activity is permissible, the Federal Reserve considers whether performing the activity can be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or control of any subsidiary when the continuation of the activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company.",

The election must be accompanied by a certification that all of the company’s insured depository institution subsidiaries are “well capitalized” and “well managed.” Additionally, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 rating of each subsidiary bank must be satisfactory or better. If, after becoming a financial holding company and undertaking activities not permissible for a bank holding company, the company fails to continue to meet any of the prerequisites for financial holding company status, the company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company.

Similarly, the Bank Merger Act prohibits the applicable federal bank regulatory agency from approving a proposed merger transaction whose effect in any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade. An exception may be made in the case of a merger transaction whose effect would be to substantially lessen competition, tend to create a monopoly, or otherwise restrain trade, if the applicable federal bank regulatory agency finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.",

While there are various legal and regulatory limitations under federal and state law on the extent to which banks can pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to holding companies, a principal source of cash revenues for the Company is dividends from the Bank. The relevant federal and state regulatory agencies have authority to prohibit a state bank or bank holding company, which would include the Bank and the Company, from engaging in what, in the opinion of such regulatory body, constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business. The payment of dividends could, depending upon the financial condition of a bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business.",

Specifically, an insured depository institution, such as Live Oak Bank, is prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become “undercapitalized” (as such term is defined in the applicable law and regulations).",

The Federal Reserve has also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if any of the holding company’s bank subsidiaries are classified as undercapitalized.",

The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve.",
        "Capital Adequacy",
        "General.  The Company must comply with the Federal Reserve’s established capital adequacy standards, and Live Oak Bank is required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the FDIC. The Federal Reserve has promulgated two basic measures of capital adequacy for bank holding companies: a risk-based measure and a leverage measure. A bank holding company must satisfy all applicable capital standards to be considered in compliance.",
        "The risk-based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies, account for off-balance-sheet exposure and minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets.",
        "Assets and off-balance-sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance-sheet items. Under applicable capital standards, the minimum risk-based capital ratios are a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6%, and a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8%. In addition, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Company and the Bank are required to meet a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in addition to the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. The capital conservation buffer is set at a ratio of 2.5% common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, which sits “on top” of the 4.5% minimum common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio. Common equity Tier 1 capital is predominantly composed of retained earnings and common stock instruments (that meet strict delineated criteria), net of treasury stock, and after making necessary capital deductions and adjustments. Tier 1 capital is composed of common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital, which consists of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and similar instruments meeting specified eligibility criteria and “TARP” preferred stock and other instruments issued under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Total capital is composed of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital, which consists of subordinated debt with a minimum original maturity of at least five years and a limited amount of loan loss reserves.",
        "At December 31, 2020, the Company's risk-based capital ratios, as calculated under applicable capital standards were 12.15%  common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets, 12.15% Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets, and 13.39% total capital to risk weighted assets.",
        "In addition, the Federal Reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total on-balance sheet assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets, of 4% for bank holding companies. The Company’s ratio at December 31, 2020 was 8.40% compared to 10.65% at December 31, 2019. The guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will consider a “tangible Tier 1 Capital leverage ratio” and other indications of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities.",
        "Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on taking brokered deposits and certain other restrictions on its business. As described below, the FDIC can impose substantial additional restrictions upon FDIC-insured depository institutions that fail to meet applicable capital requirements.",

        "Prompt Corrective Action.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or FDI Act, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” if a depository institution does not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDI Act establishes five capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation.",
        "An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. As of December 31, 2020, Live Oak Bank had capital levels that qualify as “well capitalized” under the applicable regulations.",
        "The FDI Act generally prohibits an FDIC-insured bank from making a capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the bank is or would thereafter be “undercapitalized.” “Undercapitalized” banks are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The federal regulators may not accept a capital restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the bank’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the bank’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan until the institution has been adequately capitalized on average during each of four consecutive calendar quarters. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company under such guaranty is limited to the lesser of: (i) an amount equal to 5% of the bank’s total assets at the time it became “undercapitalized”; and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.”",
        "“Significantly undercapitalized” insured banks may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator, may not make any payment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt, extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction, or enter into any material transaction outside the ordinary course of business. ",
        "A bank that is not “well capitalized” is also subject to certain limitations relating to brokered deposits. If a bank is not well-capitalized, it cannot accept brokered deposits without prior FDIC approval. Even if approved, rate restrictions will govern the rate the institution may pay on the brokered deposits. In addition, a bank that is less than well-capitalized generally cannot offer an effective yield in excess of 75 basis points over the “national rate” (as defined below) paid on deposits (including brokered deposits, if approval is granted for the bank to accept them) of comparable size and maturity. The “national rate” is defined as a simple average of rates paid by insured depository institutions and branches for which data are available and is published weekly by the FDIC. Institutions subject to the restrictions that believe they are operating in an area where the rates paid on deposits are higher than the “national rate” can use the local market to determine the prevailing rate if they seek and receive a determination from the FDIC that it is operating in a high rate area. Regardless of the determination, institutions must use the national rate to determine conformance for all deposits outside their market area.",

        "In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approved final rules that established an integrated regulatory capital framework that addressed shortcomings in certain capital requirements. The rules implemented in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. These rules have applied to the Company since 2015.  Compliance by the Company and the Bank with these capital requirements affects their respective operations by increasing the amount of capital required to conduct operations.",

        "Community Bank Leverage Ratio.  As discussed below, in 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”) became law, which directed the federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) of not less than 8 percent and not more than 10 percent for qualifying community banking organizations.  EGRRCPA defines a qualifying community banking organization as a depository institution or depository institution holding company with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, which would include the Company and the Bank.  A qualifying community banking organization that exceeds the CBLR level established by the agencies is considered to have met: (i) the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under the agencies’ capital rule; (ii) the capital ratio requirements in order to be considered well capitalized under the agencies’ prompt corrective action framework (in the case of insured depository institutions); and (iii) any other applicable capital or leverage requirements.  Section 201 of EGRRCPA defines the CBLR as the ratio of a banking organization’s CBLR tangible equity to its average total consolidated assets, both as reported on the banking organization’s applicable regulatory filing.  ",
        "In 2019, the FDIC passed a final rule on the CBLR, setting the minimum required CBLR at 9 percent.  The rule went into effect in 2020.  Under the final rule, a qualifying community banking organization may elect to use the CBLR framework if its CBLR is greater than 9 percent.  A qualifying community banking organization that has chosen the proposed framework is not required to calculate the existing risk-based and leverage capital requirements.  A bank is also considered to have met the capital ratio requirements to be well capitalized for the agencies’ prompt corrective action rules provided it has a CBLR greater than 9 percent.  The Company has not elected to implement the CBLR framework at this time.",

        "The Company must comply with numerous laws related to any potential acquisition activity. Under the BHCA, a bank holding company may not directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank or merge or consolidate with another bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. The acquisition of non-banking companies is also regulated by the Federal Reserve. Current federal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies without geographic limitation. Furthermore, a bank headquartered in one state is authorized to merge with a bank headquartered in another state, as long as neither of the states has opted out of such interstate merger authority prior to such date, and subject to any state requirement that the target bank shall have been in existence and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and to certain deposit market-share limitations. After a bank has established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where a bank headquartered in that state could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. Additionally, under the Dodd-Frank Act, banks are permitted to open a de novo branch in any state if that state would permit a bank organized in that state to open a branch.",
        "Restrictions on Affiliate Transactions",
        "Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act establish parameters for a bank to conduct “covered transactions” with its affiliates, with the objective of limiting risk to the insured bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B (i) limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such bank’s capital stock and surplus, and limit the aggregate of all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus and (ii) require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank or subsidiary as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to the affiliate, purchase of assets from the affiliate, issuance of a guaranty on behalf of the affiliate and several other types of transactions.",
        "The Dodd-Frank Act imposed additional restrictions on transactions between affiliates by amending these two sections of the Federal Reserve Act.

        "The Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC.  The standard FDIC insurance coverage amount is $250,000 per depositor.  The FDIC maintains its Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF, for the purposes of (1) insuring the deposits and protecting the depositors of insured banks and (2) resolving failed banks.  The DIF is funded mainly through quarterly assessments on insured banks, but also receives interest income on securities.  The DIF is reduced by loss provisions associated with failed banks and by FDIC operating expenses.  ",

        "The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit insurance premium assessment on member institutions in order to maintain the DIF.  The assessment rates for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities, which for established small institutions like the Bank (i.e., those institutions with less than $10 billion in assets and insured for five years or more), is generally determined by reference to the institution’s supervisory ratings.  The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. Live Oak Bank’s insurance assessments during 2020 and 2019 were $7.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively. The FDIC may terminate insurance of deposits upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.",
        "The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the base for FDIC insurance assessments, requiring that assessments be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. In 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement the foregoing provision of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the final rule revised the assessment rate schedule to provide initial base assessment rates ranging from 5 to 35 basis points, subject to adjustments which could increase or decrease the total base assessment rates. The FDIC has three possible adjustments to an institution’s initial base assessment rate: (1) a decrease of up to five basis points (or 50% of the initial base assessment rate) for long-term unsecured debt, including senior unsecured debt (other than debt guaranteed under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program) and subordinated debt; (2) an increase for holding long-term unsecured or subordinated debt issued by other insured depository institutions known as the Depository Institution Debt Adjustment; and (3) for institutions not well rated and well capitalized, an increase not to exceed 10 basis points for brokered deposits in excess of 10 percent of domestic deposits.",
        "The law also gives the FDIC enhanced discretion to set assessment rate levels.  A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Company and the Bank.  Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.  ",

The Volcker Rule became fully effective in 2015, and banking entities had until 2017, to divest certain legacy investments in covered funds.  The Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of Currency, FDIC, SEC, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission finalized amendments to the Volcker Rule in 2019, which relate primarily to the Volcker Rule’s proprietary trading and compliance program requirements.  These amendments to the Volcker Rule became effective in 2020, with compliance required by January 1, 2021.

Further, pursuant to EGRRCPA enacted in 2018 and discussed below, community banks are excluded from the restrictions of the Volcker Rule if (i) the community bank, and every entity that controls it, has total consolidated assets equal to or less than $10 billion and (ii) trading assets and liabilities of the community bank, and every entity that controls it, are equal to or less than five percent of its total consolidated assets.  The Company and Live Oak Bank are currently below these thresholds and thus exempt from the Volcker Rule.",

        "We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or we may incur increased costs in doing so.",
        "We must attract and retain qualified non-executive personnel in the markets in which we operate in order to provide our services. We compete for personnel with other providers of social and medical services as well as companies in other service-based industries. Increased competition for trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel. We may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates we charge for our services. An increase in personnel costs could negatively impact our business. In addition, if we fail to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel, our ability to conduct our business operations effectively would be harmed.",
        "Competition may be greater for managers, such as regional and agency directors. Our ability to attract and retain personnel depends on several factors, including our ability to provide employees with attractive assignments and competitive benefits and salaries. The loss of one or more of the members of the executive management team or the inability of a new management team to successfully execute our strategies may adversely affect our business. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may be unable to provide our services, the quality of our services may decline, and we could lose consumers and referral sources.",
        "With the widespread adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality and other labor-intensive industries, we continue to believe we will have an opportunity to increase our hiring of new caregivers in the long term. However, in the near term, the enhanced unemployment benefits offered by several states have suppressed the opportunity to attract this new pool of potential caregivers in these states. For example in September 2020, the state of New York announced the Lost Wages Assistance (“LWA”) program, which provides an additional $300 in weekly benefits to unemployed individuals. ",

Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), securities laws administered by the SEC and state securities authorities, and anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to our operations and results.",
        "Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than stockholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of our business; the kinds and amounts of investments we may make; required capital levels relative to our assets; the nature and amount of collateral for loans; the establishment of branches; our ability to merge, consolidate and acquire; dealings with our insiders and affiliates; and our payment of dividends. In reaction to the global financial crisis and particularly following passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), we experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time and caused our compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. Then, in May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”) was enacted by Congress in part to provide regulatory relief for community banks and their holding companies. To that end, the law eliminated questions about the applicability of certain Dodd-Frank Act reforms to community bank systems, including relieving us of any requirement to engage in mandatory stress tests, maintain a risk committee or comply with the Volcker Rule’s complicated prohibitions on proprietary trading and ownership of private funds. We believe these reforms are favorable to our operations.   ",

Because of the need for social distancing measures, the agencies revamped the manner in which they conducted periodic examinations of their regulated institutions, including making greater use of off-site reviews.

        "Regulation and Supervision of the Company",
        "General. The Company, as the sole stockholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company. As a bank holding company, we are registered with, and are subject to regulation supervision and enforcement by, the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. We are legally obligated to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where we might not otherwise do so. Under the BHCA, we are subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve. We are required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of our operations and such additional information regarding us and our subsidiary as the Federal Reserve may require.",
        "Acquisitions and Activities. The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks. The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank holding company. Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA), the Federal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its FDIC-insured institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions. ",

        "The BHCA generally prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of 5% or more of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, 1999 to be “so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto.” This authority permits us to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a savings association, or any entity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development) and mortgage banking and brokerage services. The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. ",
        "Additionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of FDIC-insured institutions or the financial system generally. We have not elected to operate as a financial holding company. ",
        "Change in Control. Federal law prohibits any person or company from acquiring “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. “Control” is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 10% and 24.99% ownership.",
        "BHC Capital Requirements. As of the date of this filing, the Federal Reserve has not requested that we report consolidated regulatory capital, recognizing the exemption under the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement applicable to holding companies with less than $3 billion in total assets (as long as they do not: engage in significant nonbanking activities, conduct significant off-balance sheet activities, or have a material amount of debt or equity securities registered with the SEC).  Unless the Federal Reserve determines otherwise, we are considered well-capitalized, as long as the Bank is well-capitalized. For capital requirements applicable to the Bank, see – “Capital Requirements” below. ",
        "Dividend Payments. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be affected by both general corporate law considerations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies.  As a Wisconsin corporation, we are subject to the limitations of Wisconsin law, which allows us to pay dividends unless, after giving it effect, any of the following would occur: (i) we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or (ii) the total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amount that would be needed if we were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend payment, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose rights are superior to the rights of the stockholders receiving the distribution.",
        "As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to stockholders if:  (i) the company’s net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.  These factors have come into consideration in the industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we do not anticipate any changes to our dividend policy and have no current plans to suspend our common stock dividend. The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations.  Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies.  ",
        "Monetary Policy.  The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, and this is evidenced in its reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Among the tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities and changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings.  These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.",

It increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments and authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate and solicit voters for their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of bank holding companies, regardless of whether such companies are publicly traded.",
        "Supervision and Regulation of the Bank",

The Bank is a Wisconsin state-chartered bank.  The deposit accounts of the Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations, currently $250,000 per insured depositor category.  As a Wisconsin-chartered FDIC-insured bank, The Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the WDFI, the chartering authority for Wisconsin banks, and the FDIC, designated by federal law as the primary federal regulator of insured state banks that, like the Bank, are not members of the Federal Reserve System (nonmember banks).",
        "Deposit Insurance.  As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC.  The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification.  For institutions like the Bank that are not considered large and highly complex banking organizations, assessments are now based on examination ratings and financial ratios. The total base assessment rates currently range from 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. At least semi-annually, the FDIC updates its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increases or decreases the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking.",
        "The reserve ratio is the FDIC insurance fund balance divided by estimated insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act altered the minimum reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits. The reserve ratio reached 1.36% as of September 30, 2018, exceeding the statutory required minimum. As a result, the FDIC provided assessment credits to insured depository institutions, like the Bank, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The FDIC applied the small bank credits for quarterly assessment periods beginning July 1, 2019.  However, the reserve ratio then fell to 1.30% in 2020 as a result of extraordinary insured deposit growth caused by an unprecedented inflow of more than $1 trillion in estimated insured deposits in the first half of 2020, stemming mainly from the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the FDIC could have ceased the small bank credits, it waived the requirement that the reserve ratio be at least 1.35% for full remittance of the remaining assessment credits, and it refunded all small bank credits as of September 30, 2020. ",
        "Supervisory Assessments. All Wisconsin banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the WDFI to fund the operations of that agency.  The amount of the assessment is calculated on the basis of the Bank’s total assets. ",
        "Capital Requirements.",
        "Regulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the risks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions are generally required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects our earnings capabilities. While capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress.  Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, discussed below, establish capital standards for banks and most bank holding companies that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place previously.",
        "Capital Levels.  Banks have been required to hold minimum levels of capital based on guidelines established by the bank regulatory agencies since 1983. The minimums have been expressed in terms of ratios of “capital” divided by “total assets\". The capital guidelines for U.S. banks beginning in 1989 have been based upon international capital accords (known as “Basel” rules) adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors that acts as the primary global standard-setter for prudential regulation, as implemented by the U.S. bank regulatory agencies on an interagency basis. The accords recognized that bank assets for the purpose of the capital ratio calculations needed to be risk weighted (the theory being that riskier assets should require more capital) and that off-balance sheet exposures needed to be factored in the calculations. Following the global financial crisis, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known as Basel III, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis.   ",

        " Basel III Rule. In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in pertinent part, and, at the same time, promulgated rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Rule”). In contrast to capital requirements historically, which were in the form of guidelines, Basel III was released in the form of binding regulations by each of the regulatory agencies. The Basel III Rule increased the required quantity and quality of capital and required more detailed categories of risk weighting of riskier, more opaque assets. For nearly every class of assets, the Basel III Rule requires a more complex, detailed and calibrated assessment of risk in the calculation of risk weightings. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies, other than “small bank holding companies” (generally certain holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $3 billion, like the Company) and certain qualifying banking organizations that may elect a simplified framework (which we have not done). Thus, the Bank is subject to the Basel III Rule as described below.",
        "Not only did the Basel III Rule increase most of the required minimum capital ratios in effect prior to January 1, 2015, but, in requiring that forms of capital be of higher quality to absorb loss, it introduced the concept of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of Treasury stock), retained earnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments. The Basel III Rule also changed the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (primarily non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that meets certain requirements) and Tier 2 Capital (primarily other types of preferred stock and subordinated debt, subject to limitations).  The Basel III Rule also constrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and required deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital in the event that such assets exceeded a percentage of a banking institution’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.  ",
        "The Basel III Rule required minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015, as follows: ",
        " ",
        "•",
        "A ratio of minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets;",
        " ",
        "•",
        "A ratio of minimum Tier 1 Capital equal to 6% of risk-weighted assets; ",
        " ",
        "•",
        "A continuation of the minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8% of risk-weighted assets; and",
        " ",
        "•",
        "A minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly average assets equal to 4% in all circumstances.",
        "In addition, institutions that seek the freedom to make capital distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of stock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to a capital conservation buffer. The purpose of the conservation buffer is to ensure that banking institutions maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress. Factoring in the conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios depicted above to 7% for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% for Total Capital.  The federal bank regulators released a joint statement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic reminding the industry that capital and liquidity buffers were meant to give banks the means to support the economy in adverse situations, and that the agencies would support banks that use the buffers for that purpose if undertaken in a safe and sound manner.  ",
        "Well-Capitalized Requirements. The ratios described above are minimum standards in order for banking organizations to be considered “adequately capitalized.” Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banks to hold more capital and be “well-capitalized” and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking organization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits. Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. For example, the Federal Reserve’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions (i.e., Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the minimum levels.",

        "Prompt Corrective Action. The concept of an institution being “well-capitalized” is part of a regulatory enforcement regime that provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take “prompt corrective action” to resolve the problems of institutions based on the capital level of each particular institution.  The extent of the regulators’ powers depends on whether the institution in question is “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized,” in each case as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators’ corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution’s asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution.",
        "Community Bank Capital Simplification.  Community banks have long raised concerns with bank regulators about the regulatory burden, complexity, and costs associated with certain provisions of the Basel III Rule.  In response, Congress provided an “off-ramp” for institutions, like us, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act instructed the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (“CBLR”) of between 8 and 10%. Under the final rule, a community banking organization is eligible to elect the new framework if it has: less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a CBLR greater than 9%. The bank regulatory agencies temporarily lowered the CBLR to 8% as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bank may elect the CBLR framework at any time but has not currently determined to do so.",
        "Liquidity Requirements. Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which bank assets may be converted to cash.  Liquid assets are those that can be converted to cash quickly if needed to meet financial obligations.  To remain viable, FDIC-insured institutions must have enough liquid assets to meet their near-term obligations, such as withdrawals by depositors.  In addition to liquidity guidelines already in place, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies implemented the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio, or LCR, in September 2014, which require large financial firms to hold levels of liquid assets sufficient to protect against constraints on their funding during times of financial turmoil.  While the LCR only applies to the largest banking organizations in the country, we continue to review our liquidity risk management policies in light of these developments.",
        "Dividend Payments. The primary source of funds for the Company is dividends from the Bank.  Under Wisconsin law, the board of directors of a bank may declare and pay a dividend from its undivided profits in an amount they consider expedient. The board of directors must provide for the payment of all expenses, losses, required reserves, taxes, and interest accrued or due from the bank before the declaration of dividends from undivided profits. If dividends declared and paid in either of the two immediately preceding years exceeded net income for either of those two years respectively, the bank may not declare or pay any dividend in the current year that exceeds year-to-date net income except with the written consent of the division.  The FDIC and the WDFI may prohibit the payment of dividends by the Bank if either or both determine such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.  In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends have to maintain 2.5 percent in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer.  See “—Capital Requirements” above.",
        "State Bank Investments and Activities.  The Bank is permitted to make investments and engage in activities directly or through subsidiaries as authorized by Wisconsin law. However, under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC-insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank.

These restrictions have not had, and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on the operations of the Bank.",
        "Insider Transactions. The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on “covered transactions” between the Bank and its “affiliates.” The Company is an affiliate of the Bank for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to the Company, investments in the stock or other securities of the Company and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as collateral for loans made by the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.",
        "Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the Bank to its directors and officers, to directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, to principal stockholders of the Company and to “related interests” of such directors, officers and principal stockholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person who is a director or officer of the Company or the Bank, or a principal stockholder of the Company, may obtain credit from banks with which the Bank maintains a correspondent relationship.",
        "Safety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management. The federal banking agencies have adopted operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of FDIC-insured institutions. The standards apply to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.",
        "In general, the safety and soundness standards prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals.  While regulatory standards do not have the force of law, if an institution operates in an unsafe and unsound manner, the FDIC-insured institution’s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an FDIC-insured institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator’s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the FDIC-insured institution’s rate of growth, require the FDIC-insured institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Noncompliance with safety and soundness may also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments.",
        "During the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the FDIC-insured institutions they supervise.  Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets.  The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal and reputational risk. The federal bank regulators have identified key risk themes for 2021 as: credit risk management given projected weaker economic conditions and commercial and residential real estate concentration risk management. The agencies will also be monitoring banks for their transition away from LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) as a reference rate, compliance risk management related to COVID-19 pandemic-related activities, Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering (“AML”) compliance, cybersecurity, planning for and implementation of the current-expected-credit-losses (“CECL”) accounting standard, and CRA performance.  The Bank is expected to have active board and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls.",
        "Privacy and Cybersecurity. The Bank is subject to many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect non-public confidential information of their customers. These laws require the Bank to periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and permit consumers to opt out of their ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. They also impact the Bank’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. In addition, as a part of its operational risk mitigation, the Bank is required to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information and to require the same of its service providers. These security and privacy policies and procedures are in effect across all business lines and geographic locations.",
        "Branching Authority. Wisconsin banks, such as the Bank, have the authority under Wisconsin law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Wisconsin, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. The establishment of new interstate branches has historically been permitted only in those states the laws of which expressly authorize such expansion. The Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new interstate branches or acquire individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) without impediments.

",
        "Transaction Account Reserves.  Federal law requires FDIC-insured institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts) to provide liquidity. Reserves are maintained on deposit at the Federal Reserve Banks. The reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve, and, for 2020, the Federal Reserve had determined that the first $16.9 million of otherwise reservable balances had a zero percent reserve requirement; for transaction accounts aggregating between $16.9 million to $127.5 million, the reserve requirement was 3% of those transaction account balances; and for net transaction accounts in excess of $127.5 million, the reserve requirement was 10% of the aggregate amount of total transaction account balances in excess of $127.5 million. However, in March 2020, in an unprecedented move, the Federal Reserve announced that the banking system had ample reserves, and, as reserve requirements no longer played a significant role in this regime, it reduced all reserve tranches to zero percent, thereby freeing banks from the reserve maintenance requirement. The action permits the Bank to loan or invest funds that were previously unavailable. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects to continue to operate in an ample reserves regime for the foreseeable future. ",
        " Community Reinvestment Act Requirements. The CRA requires the Bank to have a continuing and affirmative obligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of the entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.

Applications for additional acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of the Bank’s effectiveness in meeting its CRA requirements.",
        "Anti-Money Laundering. The USA Patriot Act is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and has significant implications for FDIC-insured institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The USA Patriot Act mandates financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address any or all of the following matters: (i) customer identification programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation between FDIC-insured institutions and law enforcement authorities. ",
        "Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate. Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. A concentration in commercial real estate is one example of regulatory concern. The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance (“CRE Guidance”) provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) commercial real estate loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit banks’ levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk. ",

The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like the Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators. ",

        "Government Regulation of Health Information",
        "Privacy and Security Regulations.",
        " The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA and implementing regulations contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of a subset of individually identifiable health information, referred to as PHI and require covered entities, including health plans, health care clearinghouses, and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf.",
        "Certain provisions of the privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA apply to business associates (entities that perform functions on behalf of, or provide services to, covered entities involving the handling of PHI), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties per violation. The civil penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity.  Most of our customers are covered entities and we are a business associate to many such customers under HIPAA as a result of our contractual obligations to perform certain functions on behalf of, and provide certain services to, those customers. As a business associate, we sometimes also act as a clearinghouse in performing certain functions for our customers. ",
        "In order to provide our covered entity customers with services that involve the use or disclosure of PHI, HIPAA requires our customers to enter into business associate agreements with us. Such business associate agreements among other things, (i) dictate how we may use and disclose PHI, (ii) require us to implement reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect PHI from misuse, (iii) report security incidents and other improper uses or disclosures of PHI, and (iv) impose these same obligations through agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to PHI.",
        "17",
        "Transaction Requirements.",
        " In addition to privacy and security requirements, HIPAA also requires that certain electronic transactions related to healthcare billing be conducted using uniform electronic data transmission standards and code sets for certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. We are contractually required to structure and provide our services in a way that supports our customers’ HIPAA compliance obligations. ",
        "Data Security and Breaches.",
        " In recent years, there have been well-publicized data breach incidents involving the improper dissemination of personal health and other information of individuals, both within and outside of the healthcare industry. Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured PHI to affected individuals without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days after discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Notification also must be made to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (“HHS”) and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. Impermissible uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability that the unsecured PHI has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations also may require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information. In many cases, these state laws are limited to electronic data, but states are increasingly enacting or considering stricter and broader requirements. In addition, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. We have implemented and maintain physical, technical, and administrative safeguards intended to protect all personal data, and have processes in place to assist us in complying with applicable laws and regulations regarding the protection of this data and properly responding to any security incidents and data breaches.",
        "State Laws.",
        " In addition to HIPAA, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the unauthorized disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements. Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we must comply with them even though they may be subject to different interpretations by various courts and other governmental authorities. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) affords consumers expanded privacy protections effective January 1, 2020. The potential effects of this legislation are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. For example, the CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches.",
        "Other Requirements.",
        " In addition to HIPAA, there are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. We and our customers may be subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties.  The FTC has issued guidance for, and several states have issued or are considering new regulations to require, holders of certain types of personally identifiable information to implement formal policies and programs to prevent, detect, and mitigate the risk of identity theft and other unauthorized access to or use of such information. Further, federal and state legislation has been proposed, and through rule making or executive action, several states have taken action, to restrict or discourage the disclosure of medical or other personally identifiable information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States.",
        "18",
        "International Laws. ",
        "In addition to data privacy and security statutes in the United States, the European Union (“EU”) introduced the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). GDPR became applicable on May 25, 2018, and applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or any targeting activities toward the EU. GDPR creates an enhanced range of compliance obligations, including duties as to privacy notices, legal bases for processing, data retention, data security, and rights for individuals. Additionally, GDPR significantly increases financial penalties for non-compliance, including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements. The extent to which our activities conducted from an establishment in the UK or targeting activities toward the UK remain subject to the same or similar requirements as GDPR depends upon how the UK chooses to regulate privacy and data security now that the UK has left the EU. ",
        "Government Regulation of Reimbursement",
        "Our customers are subject to regulation by a number of governmental agencies, including those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Accordingly, our customers are sensitive to legislative and regulatory changes in, and limitations on, the government healthcare programs and changes in reimbursement policies, processes, and payment rates. During recent years, there have been numerous federal legislative and administrative actions that have affected government programs, including adjustments that have reduced or increased payments to physicians and other healthcare providers and adjustments that have affected the complexity of our work. For example, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) established a Quality Payment Program (“QPP”) that requires physician groups to track and report a multitude of data relating to quality, clinical practice improvement activities, use of an electronic health record, and cost. Success or failure with respect to these measures may impact reimbursement in future years. Similarly, in 2021, hospitals participating in the Medicare Value-Based Purchasing Program, which requires the reporting of quality and cost measures, may receive a net decrease in payments of up to 1.62%. It is possible that the federal or state governments will implement additional reductions, increases, or changes in reimbursement in the future under government programs that adversely affect our customer base or increase the cost of providing our services. Any such changes could adversely affect our own financial condition by reducing the reimbursement rates of our customers.",
        "Fraud and Abuse Laws",
        "A number of health care fraud and abuse laws apply to hospitals, physicians, and others who (i) furnish health care services to patients and submit claims for reimbursement to government programs and/or commercial insurers, and (ii) refer patients to one another. Given the breadth of these laws, they may affect our business, either directly or because they apply to our customers. These laws and regulations include:",
        "False Claims Laws.",
        " There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid (i) submitting a false claim, (ii) causing the submission of a false claims, (iii) retaining a known overpayment, or (iv) engaging in similar types of conduct. The federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”), 31 U.S.C. §3729 et seq., for example, prohibits (i) knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval, or (ii) knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. Further, under its so-called “reverse false clams” provision, the federal FCA imposes liability on any person who knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government. An obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government, in turn, may arise if a person identifies an overpayment and fails to report and return the overpayment to the government within 60 days. Violations of the FCA may result in treble damages and per claim fines ranging from $11,665 to $22,331. The FCA may be enforced by the government or by private whistleblowers under the “qui tam” provisions of the statute. Whistleblowers are entitled to a share of any recovery in an FCA case. Other federal laws, such as those governing the imposition of civil monetary penalties, 42 U.S.C. §1320a-7a, prohibit similar conduct, as do many state laws.",
        "19",
        "Anti-Kickback Laws. ",
        "There are numerous federal and state laws that prohibit one person from providing anything of value to another person if one purpose of the arrangement is to induce the payee to refer patients or other business to the payor for services that are covered by a government program (or, in the case of some state laws, a commercial insurer). For example, the federal health care program anti-kickback statute (“AKS”), 42 U.S.C. §1320a-7b(b), prohibits one person from “knowingly and willfully” offering or paying any “remuneration” to another person to induce the recipient to (i) refer an individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federal health care program, or (ii) purchase, lease, order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program. The AKS also prohibits a person from soliciting or receiving remuneration in exchange for engaging in any of these activities. Violation of the AKS can result in imprisonment, fines, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs (“program exclusion”), and exposure under the FCA. Many states have adopted anti-inducement laws similar to the AKS. In some cases, these state laws are narrower than the federal AKS (applying only to certain categories of persons, such as physicians). In other cases, the state laws are broader than the federal AKS (covering inducements to refer not only government program patients and business but commercially insured patients and business as well).",
        "Physician Self-Referral Laws. ",
        "Under the federal physician self-referral law (or “Stark Law”), 42 U.S.C. §1395nn, if a physician (or one or his or her immediate family members) has a financial relationship with a health care provider (such as a hospital), then, in the absence of an applicable exception (i) the physician may not refer Medicare beneficiaries to that provider for certain so-called “designated health services,” and (ii) in the event of such a referral, the provider may not bill Medicare, the beneficiary, or any other person for those services. Violations of the referral and billing prohibitions of the Stark Law can result in civil monetary penalties, program exclusion, and exposure under the FCA. Many states have their own physician self-referral laws. These state laws vary widely, in some cases being narrower, and in other cases broader, than the Stark Law. ",
        "Health care fraud and abuse laws, such as those described above, apply to many of our customers and, under some circumstances, could apply to us. Although we believe that our practices and our customers’ practices are generally in compliance with these laws, we cannot be certain that governmental officials or others will not assert otherwise.",
        "Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act",
        "The federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) was enacted to ensure public access to emergency services regardless of a patient’s insurance status or ability to pay. Specifically, EMTALA requires Medicare-participating hospitals to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment. If the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, the hospital must either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer an individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the individual’s ability to pay. Sanctions for violating EMTALA include program exclusion and civil monetary penalties. These civil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. In addition, the law creates a private right of action for any individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a violation of the law. A hospital that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s violation of the law also has a similar right.",
        "EMTALA generally applies to our customers that are Medicare-participating hospitals, and we assist our customers with the intake of their patients. Although we believe that our customers’ practices are generally in compliance with the law and applicable regulations, we cannot be certain that governmental officials or others will not assert that we or our customers are in violation of EMTALA nor can we predict what obligations may be imposed by regulations to be issued in the future.",
        "20",
        "Laws Limiting Assignment of Reimbursement Claims",
        "Various federal and state laws limit whether and the extent to which claims for reimbursement from a government program can be assigned (by a patient to a provider) or reassigned (by one provider to another person). We do not believe that our customers reassign their claims for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement to us. Any determination to the contrary, however, could adversely affect our ability to be paid for the services we provide to our customers, require us to restructure the manner in which we are paid, or have further regulatory consequences.",
        "Regulation of Debt Collection Activities",
        "The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”) regulates persons who regularly collect or attempt to collect, directly or indirectly, consumer debts owed or asserted to be owed to another person. Certain of our accounts receivable activities may be deemed to be subject to the FDCPA. The FDCPA establishes specific guidelines and procedures that debt collectors must follow in communicating with consumer debtors, including the time, place, and manner of such communications. Further, it prohibits harassment or abuse by debt collectors, including the threat of violence or criminal prosecution, obscene language, or repeated telephone calls made with the intent to abuse or harass. The FDCPA also places restrictions on communications with individuals other than consumer debtors in connection with the collection of any consumer debt and sets forth specific procedures to be followed when communicating with such third parties for purposes of obtaining location information about the consumer. In addition, the FDCPA contains various notice and disclosure requirements and prohibits unfair or misleading representations by debt collectors. Finally, the FDCPA imposes certain limitations on lawsuits to collect debts against consumers.",
        "Debt collection activities are also regulated at the state level. Most states have laws regulating debt collection activities in ways that are similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, the FDCPA. In addition, some states require companies engaged in the collection of consumer debt to be licensed. In all states where we operate, we believe that we (1) currently hold all required licenses, (2) are in the process of requesting and retaining all applicable licenses, or, (3) are exempt from licensing.",
        "We are also subject to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”). In the process of communicating with our customers’ patients, we use a variety of communications methods. The TCPA places certain restrictions on companies that place telephone calls to consumers.",
        "The FTC has the authority to investigate consumer complaints relating to the FDCPA and the TCPA, and to initiate or recommend enforcement actions, including actions to seek monetary penalties. State officials typically have authority to enforce corresponding state laws. In addition, affected consumers may bring suits, including class action suits, to seek monetary remedies (including statutory damages) for violations of the federal and state provisions discussed above.",
        "Regulation of Credit Card Activities",
        "We process, on behalf of our customers, credit card payments from their patients. Various federal and state laws impose privacy and information security laws and regulations with respect to the use of credit cards. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a credit card security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal or financial risk as a result of non-compliance.",

Legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of patents can be uncertain. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Our patent applications may not result in the grant of patents with the scope of the claims that we seek, if at all, or the scope of the granted claims may not be sufficiently broad to protect our products and technology. Our four granted patents or any patents that may be granted in the future from pending or future applications may be opposed, contested, circumvented, designed around by a third party, or found to be invalid or unenforceable. Third parties may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate, or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technologies or design around patents owned or licensed by us. If our technology is found to infringe any patent or other intellectual property right held by a third party, we could be prevented from providing our service offerings and/or subjected to significant damage awards.",

Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thereby eroding our competitive position.",
        "The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. This uncertainty includes changes to the patent laws through either legislative action to change statutory patent law or court action that may reinterpret existing law in ways affecting the scope or validity of issued patents. The patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the U.S. or foreign countries. Competitors and academic scientists in the field of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and neuromodulators have created a substantial amount of prior art, including scientific publications, patents and patent applications. Our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our technology and the prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of such issued patents or any other issued patents we own or license, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. For example, patents granted by the European Patent Office may be opposed by any person within nine months from the publication of their grant. Our European Patent EP 2 661 276 for “Topical composition comprising botulinum toxin and a dye” was opposed in the European Patent Office by Allergan plc on May 2, 2018, and although this patent is not material to our business, we continue to take appropriate measures to defend the patent, including an appeal of a decision to revoke the patent, which decision is suspended in view of the appeal. On May 2, 2019 our European Patent No. EP 2 490 986 B1 for “Methods and Systems For Purifying Non-Complexed Botulinum Neurotoxin” was opposed. We are vigorously defending this patent in the European Patent Office. We were informed in May 2019 that our patent application NC2018/0005351 pending in Colombia for “Injectable Botulinum Toxin Formulations And Methods of Use Thereof Having Long Duration of Therapeutic Effect” was opposed. We have responded to this pre-grant opposition. Furthermore, even if our patents and applications are unchallenged, they may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims.",
        "67",
        "Table of Contents",
        "In addition, the patent laws of the U.S. provide procedures for third parties to challenge the validity of issued patents. Patents issued from applications filed after March 15, 2013 may be challenged by third parties using the post-grant review procedure which allows challenges for a number of reasons, including prior art, sufficiency of disclosure, and subject matter eligibility. Under the inter partes review procedure, any third party may challenge the validity of any issued U.S. Patent in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) on the basis of prior art patents or printed publications. Because of a lower evidentiary standard necessary to invalidate a patent claim in USPTO proceedings as compared to the evidentiary standard relied on in U.S. federal court, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold or pursue with respect to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidates is challenged, then it could threaten our ability to commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidates, and could threaten our ability to prevent competitive products from being marketed. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or any future product candidates under patent protection would be reduced. ",
        "Since patent applications in the U.S. and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our product candidates or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications. Furthermore, for applications filed before March 16, 2013, or patents issuing from such applications, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party, or instituted by the USPTO to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications and patents. As of March 16, 2013, the U.S. transitioned to a “first-to-file” system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. The change to “first-to-file” from “first-to-invent” is one of the changes to the patent laws of the United States resulting from the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act signed into law on September 16, 2011. Among some of the other changes to the patent laws are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO.",
        "Even where laws provide protection, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and the outcome of such litigation would be uncertain.

These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. A breach of confidentiality could significantly affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisers have previous employment or consulting relationships. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use any intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in any related or resulting know-how and inventions.

The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources.

In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover its technology or that the factors necessary to grant an injunction against an infringer are not satisfied.",

Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the U.S. or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies to develop their own products in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.",

Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.",

These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change the HintMD platform, any of which would have a negative effect on HintMD's and Revance's business and operating results. In addition, if the license terms for the open source software HintMD utilizes change, HintMD and Revance may be forced to reengineer the HintMD platform or incur additional costs.

The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act (“FCA”).

Companies targeted in such prosecutions have paid substantial fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees severely restricting the manner in which they conduct business. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our activities such as contractual relationships with providers or institutions, or our marketing and promotional practices, including any HintMD rewards programs, we could be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative sanctions, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements, and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

        "From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. For example, the ACA was passed in March 2010, and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. biotechnology industry. There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the former U.S. presidential administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, the former U.S. presidential administration signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Pending review, the ACA remains in effect, but it is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business.",
        "In addition, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 contained further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. Additionally, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals, which have resulted in additional regulations from the FDA, CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services. For example, in November 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita.  This interim final rule is subject to challenge. The likelihood of implementation of any of the other former U.S. presidential administration's reform initiatives is uncertain, particularly in light of the new Biden administration. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of, or affect the price that we may charge for, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or any future product candidates including an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar.

Nielsen moved to dismiss the operative complaint on November 26, 2019. On January 4, 2021, certain of the allegations against Nielsen and its officers were dismissed, while others were sustained. Discovery is in its early stages and is ongoing. In addition, in January 2019, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in New York Supreme Court against a number of Nielsen’s current and former officers and directors. The derivative lawsuit alleges that the named officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company in connection with factual assertions substantially similar to those in the putative class action complaint. The derivative lawsuit further alleges that certain officers and directors engaged in trading Nielsen stock based on material, nonpublic information. By agreement dated June 26, 2019, the derivative lawsuit was stayed pending resolution of Nielsen’s motion to dismiss the aforementioned securities litigation. Nielsen anticipates an amended complaint will be filed in the coming months. Nielsen intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously. Based on currently available information, Nielsen believes that the Company has meritorious defenses to these actions and that their resolution is not likely to have a material adverse effect on Nielsen’s business, financial position, or results of operations",

        "Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe for insured depository institutions under its jurisdiction standards relating to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, employee compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. The federal banking agencies adopted Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement the safety and soundness standards required under federal law.  The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan, the appropriate federal banking agency may issue an enforceable order requiring correction of the deficiencies.",
        "Capital Requirements",
        "Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.",
        "In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally is defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital generally is defined as common equity Tier 1 plus additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and certain other items. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions when deemed necessary.",
        "In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until it was fully implemented at 2.50% on January 1, 2019.",
        "Legislation enacted in 2018 required the federal banking agencies, including the OCC, to specify for qualifying institutions with less than $10 billion of assets, an alternative “community bank leverage ratio” that ranges between 8% to 10% of consolidated assets. Institutions with capital levels meeting or exceeding the specified requirement and choosing the alternative regulatory capital framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including all risk-based requirements. A final rule was issued by the federal regulators, effective January 1, 2020, that establishes the elective community bank leverage ratio at 9.0% Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets. Northfield Bank elected to opt into the new framework effective March 31, 2020. Section 4012 of the CARES Act of 2020 required that the community bank leverage ratio be temporarily lowered to 8%. The federal regulators issued a rule implementing the lower ratio, effective April 23, 2020. Another rule was issued to transition back to the 9% community bank leverage ratio by increasing the ratio to 8.5% for calendar year 2021 and 9% thereafter.",
        "As of December 31, 2020, Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and Northfield Bank exceeded all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. Further, the most recent OCC notification categorized the Bank as a well-capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action regulations discussed below. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion about Regulatory Requirements.",
        "28",
        "Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action",
        "Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. OCC regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. Under the amended regulations, an institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.",
        "The regulations provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a savings institution receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company for the savings institution required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to 5.0% of the savings institution’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC, or the amount necessary to restore the savings institution to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the savings institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the OCC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. Various restrictions, including on growth and capital distributions, also apply to “undercapitalized” institutions. If an “undercapitalized” institution fails to submit an acceptable capital plan, it is treated as “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” institutions must comply with one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, an order by the OCC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss officers or directors and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.",
        "The previously referenced final rule that establishes an elective “community bank leverage ratio” provides that a qualifying institution whose Tier 1 capital equals or exceeds the specified community bank leverage ratio and opts into that framework will be considered to be “well capitalized” for purposes of prompt corrective action.",
        "Capital Distributions",
        "Federal regulations restrict “capital distributions” by savings institutions. For purposes of the regulations, capital distributions generally include cash dividends and other transactions charged to the capital account of a savings institution. A federal savings institution must file an application with the OCC for approval of the capital distribution if:",
        "•",
        "the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceeds the sum of the institution’s net income for that year to date plus the institution’s retained net income for the preceding two years that is still available for dividend;",
        "•",
        "the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;",
        "•",
        "the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or written regulatory condition; or",
        "•",
        "the institution is not eligible for expedited review of its filings (i.e., generally, institutions that do not have safety and soundness, compliance and Community Reinvestment Act ratings in the top two categories or fail a capital requirement).",
        "A savings institution that is a subsidiary of a holding company, which is the case with Northfield Bank, must file a notice with the FRB at least 30 days before the Board of Directors declares any dividend and receives FRB non-objection to the payment of the dividend.",
        "Applications or notices may be denied if the institution will be undercapitalized after the proposed dividend, the proposed dividend raises safety and soundness concerns or the proposed dividend would violate a law, regulation enforcement order, or regulatory condition.",
        "29",
        "In the event that a savings institution’s capital falls below its regulatory requirements or it is notified by the regulatory agency that it is in need of more than normal supervision, its ability to make capital distributions would be restricted. In addition, any proposed capital distribution could be prohibited if the regulatory agency determines that the distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.",
        "Transactions with Related Parties",
        "A savings institution’s authority to engage in transactions with related parties or “affiliates” is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation, FRB Regulation W. The term “affiliate” generally means any company that controls or is under common control with an institution, including Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and its non-savings institution subsidiaries (although certain subsidiaries of the institution itself are not considered affiliates). Applicable law limits the aggregate amount of “covered” transactions with any individual affiliate, including loans to the affiliate, to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings institution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings institution’s capital and surplus. Certain covered transactions with affiliates, such as loans to or guarantees issued on behalf of affiliates, are required to be secured by specified amounts of collateral. Purchasing low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Regulation W also provides that transactions with affiliates, including covered transactions, must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited by law from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.",
        "Authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% or greater shareholders (insiders), as well as entities controlled by insiders, is governed by Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation, FRB Regulation O. Among other things, loans to insiders must be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for bank-wide lending programs that do not discriminate in favor of insiders. Regulation O also places individual and aggregate limits on the amount of loans that may be made to insiders based, in part, on the institution’s capital position, and requires that certain prior board approval procedures be followed. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made. At December 31, 2020, Northfield Bank was in compliance with these regulations.",
        "Enforcement",
        "The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings institutions, including the authority to bring enforcement action against “institution-related parties,” including officers, directors, certain shareholders, and attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or \"cease and desist\" order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution, receivership, conservatorship or the termination of deposit insurance.  Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $50,000 per day (as adjusted for inflation), unless certain findings concerning intent or recklessness can be made, in which case penalties may be as high as $2 million per day.",
        "Deposit Insurance",
        "Northfield Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in Northfield Bank are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor by the FDIC.",
        "The FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions with less than $10 billion of assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution’s failure within three years.",
        "The FDIC bases its deposit insurance rate assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity. The current assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) for insured institutions of less than $10 billion of total assets is 1.5.",
        "30",
        "The minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio established by federal law was increased in 2011 from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC was required to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Federal law required institutions with assets of $10 billion or more to fund the increase from 1.15% to 1.35% and, effective July 1, 2016, such institutions became subject to a surcharge to achieve that goal. On September 30, 2018, the Deposit Insurance Fund ratio reached 1.36%, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35% ahead of the September 30, 2020 deadline. Consequently, surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more ceased; and such smaller banks received assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between 1.15% and 1.35%. The credits were exhausted as of September 30, 2020.",
        "The FDIC has established a long-range target Deposit Insurance fund ratio of 2%. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Northfield Bank. Future insurance assessments cannot be predicted.",
        "Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed in writing. Management of Northfield Bank does not know of any practice, condition, or violation that may lead to termination of the Northfield Bank’s deposit insurance.",

The FHLB System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the FHLB are required to acquire and hold a specified amount of shares of FHLB capital stock. Northfield Bank was in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2020.",

        "Savings institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.

Such activities include lending and other activities permitted for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, insurance and underwriting equity securities. Federal law specifies that any savings and loan holding company that engages in activities that are solely permissible for a financial holding company must meet the qualitative requirements for a bank holding company to be a financial holding company and conduct the activities in accordance with the requirements that would apply if that financial holding company was a bank holding company.

In evaluating applications by savings and loan holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the FRB must consider such things as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the institution, the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. An acquisition by a savings and loan holding company of a savings institution in another state to be held as a separate subsidiary may not be approved unless it is a supervisory acquisition under Section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or the law of the state in which the target is located authorizes such acquisitions by out-of-state companies.",

Additionally, Section 4013 of the CARES Act permits a financial institution to elect to suspend temporarily TDR accounting under current U.S. GAAP. To be eligible, a loan modification must be: (1) related to COVID-19; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (a) 60 days after the date of termination of the national emergency or (b) December 31, 2020. This relief was further extended by Section 541 of the Relief Act to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the date of termination of the national emergency. The relief provided includes short-term (e.g., up to six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or delays in payment that are insignificant. Borrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact to customers, the Company introduced a short-term modification program in March 2020 that provides temporary payment relief to those borrowers directly impacted by COVID-19. The program allows for a deferral of payments for 90 days, which may extend for an additional 90 days, with modifications in the form of payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment.

        "As part of our DEI efforts, the Company places a high value on engaging the organization in our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) around the globe. The Company has ERGs across nine categories, including Asian American, Visible & Invisible Disabilities, Emerging Leaders, Parents & Caregivers, LGBTQIA+, Black, Hispanic and Women. We believe the ERGs help facilitate networking and connections with peers, support the acquisition of diverse talent internally and externally, act as a sounding board for content development and programming, provide an avenue to facilitate leadership and skill development and increase the organization’s overall cultural competency.",
        "Talent",
        "The Company employed 2,002 full-time employees and 355 part-time employees as of December 31, 2020.  Our global workforce is over 50% women, with 44% of our senior leadership positions held by women. Over 27% of our U.S.-based workforce are people of color.",
        "We aim to attract top talent through our corporate brand and our reputation for innovation and high quality content, as well as through the many benefits we offer. We aim to retain our talent by emphasizing our competitive rewards; offering opportunities that support employees both personally and professionally; and our commitment to fostering a positive corporate culture.",
        "Our performance management practice includes frequent feedback and conversations between managers and team members, and talent reviews designed to identify potential future leaders and inform succession plans. We value continuous learning and development opportunities for our employees, which include: a robust internal mentorship program; dynamic ",
        "16",
        "teams that take a cross disciplinary approach to driving innovation and problem solving; leadership development programs; and tuition assistance. ",

These resources are intended to support the health, finance, and well-being of our employees.",
        "In addition, for certain of our productions, the Company, through in-house and third party production service companies, engages the services of writers, directors, actors and various crew members who are subject to certain specially negotiated collective bargaining agreements. Since these agreements are generally entered into on a per-project basis, negotiations occur on various agreements throughout the year. We believe that our relations with the labor unions and our employees are generally good.",
        "Engagement",
        "We believe having an engaged workforce is key to employee retention and satisfaction. Communication is central to our engagement efforts and include monthly CEO-hosted Virtual Town Halls; ERG panels and events; a Talks@AMC Networks speaker series featuring notable business and creative leaders from across our industry; regular internal company communications about business developments and other company news; company intranet; and an annual all staff company-wide meeting. ",
        "We aim to give our employees a voice in a variety of ways, including through formal engagement surveys, which solicit feedback on a range of topics such as company direction and strategy, leadership and management transparency, and diversity and inclusion.",
        "Culture",
        "Our Company has a proud past and a long history of innovation and originality in our storytelling. This legacy informs who we are and is imbued in our corporate culture and in our values. We embrace collaboration, openness, approachability, as well as agility and creativity. ",
        "We strive to empower our employees to have community and social impact in meaningful ways. In 2020, we instituted two employee-led giving programs – a COVID-19 relief fund and a Social Justice fund. We asked employees to identify charitable organizations focused on COVID-19 related relief efforts and racial inequality, with each employee identified organization receiving a $1,000 donation from the Company. ",
        "Other initiatives to foster community and social impact include paid time off for full-time employees for Juneteenth, Election Day and a volunteer day of their choice."

As a result, our growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including our primary regulator, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”), the Bank’s state regulator, the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (“WDFI”), and its primary federal regulator, the FDIC. Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), securities laws administered by the SEC and state securities authorities, and anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies, and accounting rules are significant to our operations and results.",
        "Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation, and enforcement on the operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies, and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than shareholders. These laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of our business, the kinds and amounts of investments the Corporation and the Bank may make, reserve requirements, required capital levels relative to assets, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with the Corporation’s and the Bank’s insiders and affiliates, and payment of dividends. In reaction to the global financial crisis beginning in 2008 (the “global financial crisis”) and particularly following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), we experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny. Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time and caused our compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. After the 2016 federal elections, momentum to decrease the regulatory burden on community banks gathered strength. In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”) was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations. While the Regulatory Relief Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion, like us, and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion that were considered systemically important under the Dodd-Frank Act solely because of size. Many of these changes were intended to result in meaningful regulatory relief for community banks and their holding companies, including new rules that may make the capital requirements less complex. For a discussion of capital requirements, see ",

        "The supervisory framework for U.S. banking organizations subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not publicly available and can impact the conduct and growth of their business. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law, or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations.",

It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations, and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.",
        "The Role of Capital",
        "Regulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the risks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions are generally required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects our earnings capabilities. While capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, discussed below, establish capital standards for banks and bank holding companies that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place previously.",
        "Minimum Required Capital Levels. ",
        "Banks have been required to hold minimum levels of capital based on guidelines established by the bank regulatory agencies since 1983. The minimums have been expressed in terms of ratios of “capital” divided by “total assets.” As discussed below, bank capital measures have become more sophisticated over the years and have focused more on the quality of capital and the risk of assets. Bank holding companies have historically had to comply with less stringent capital standards than their bank subsidiaries and have been able to raise capital with hybrid instruments such as trust preferred securities. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated the Federal Reserve to establish minimum capital levels for holding companies on a consolidated basis as stringent as those required for FDIC-insured institutions. A result of this change is that the proceeds of hybrid instruments, such as trust preferred securities, were excluded from capital over a phase-out period. However, if such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets, they may be retained, subject to certain restrictions. Because we have assets of less than $15 billion, we are able to maintain our trust preferred proceeds as capital but we have to comply with new capital mandates in other respects and will not be able to raise capital in the future through the issuance of trust preferred securities.",
        "The Basel III Rule",
        ". ",
        "On September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known as Basel III, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis. In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in pertinent part, and, at the same time, promulgated rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Rule”). In contrast to capital requirements historically, which were in the form of guidelines, Basel III was released in the form of enforceable regulations by each of the regulatory agencies. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies, other than “small bank holding companies” who are relieved from compliance with the Basel III Rule. While holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $3 billion, like the Corporation, are considered small bank holding companies for this purpose, the Corporation has securities registered with the SEC and that disqualifies us from taking advantage of the relief. Banking organizations became subject to the Basel III Rule on January 1, 2015, and its requirements were fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019.",
        "The Basel III Rule increased the required quantity and quality of capital and, for nearly every class of assets, it requires a more complex, detailed and calibrated assessment of risk and calculation of risk-weight amounts. ",
        "Not only did the Basel III Rule increase most of the required minimum capital ratios in effect prior to January 1, 2015, but it introduced the concept of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net ",
        "7",
        "of treasury stock), retained earnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments. The Basel III Rule also changed the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (primarily non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that meets certain requirements) and Tier 2 Capital (primarily other types of preferred stock and subordinated debt, subject to limitations). A number of instruments that qualified as Tier 1 Capital under Basel I do not qualify, or their qualifications changed. For example, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, which qualified as simple Tier 1 Capital under Basel I, does not qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but qualifies as Additional Tier 1 Capital. The Basel III Rule also constrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and requires deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital in the event that such assets exceed a certain percentage of a banking institution’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. ",
        "The Basel III Rule required minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015, as follows: ",
        "•",
        "A ratio of minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets;",
        "•",
        "An increase in the minimum required amount of Tier 1 Capital from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets; ",
        "•",
        "A continuation of the minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8% of risk-weighted assets; and",
        "•",
        "A minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly average assets equal to 4% in all circumstances.",
        "In addition, institutions that seek the freedom to make capital distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of stock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to a capital conservation buffer (fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019). The purpose of the conservation buffer is to ensure that banking institutions maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress. Factoring in the conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios depicted above to 7% for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% for Total Capital. ",
        "Well-Capitalized Requirements",
        ". ",
        "The ratios described above are minimum standards in order for banking organizations to be considered “adequately capitalized.” Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banks to hold more capital and be “well-capitalized” and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking organization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, roll-over, or renew brokered deposits. Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. For example, the Federal Reserve’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities, or securities trading activities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions (",

The total base assessment rates currently range from 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. At least semi-annually, the FDIC updates its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increases or decreases the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking. The assessment base against which an FDIC-insured institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the DIF has been calculated since effectiveness of the Dodd-Frank Act is based on its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. This method shifted the burden of deposit insurance premiums toward those large depository institutions that rely on funding sources other than U.S. deposits.  ",

The Dodd-Frank Act altered the minimum reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to FDIC-insured institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The reserve ratio reached 1.36% as of September 30, 2018, exceeding the statutory required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%. Accordingly, pursuant to rules adopted by the FDIC, in January 2019 the FDIC provided notice of assessment credits awarded to insured depository institutions, like the Bank, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The FDIC applies the credits each quarter (beginning with the September 2019 assessment invoice for the second quarter of 2019) that the reserve ratio is at least 1.38% to offset the regular deposit insurance assessments of institutions with credits. As of June 30, 2020, the most recent available date, the reserve ratio was 1.30%.",

The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance (“CRE Guidance”) provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) commercial real estate loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit banks’ levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations.

        "The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) commenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including the Bank, as well as the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like the Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators. ",
        "Because abuses in connection with residential mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the financial crisis, many new rules issued by the CFPB and required by the Dodd-Frank Act addressed mortgage and mortgage-related products, their underwriting, origination, servicing, and sales. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded underwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augmented federal law combating predatory lending practices. In addition to numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd‑Frank Act imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banks and savings associations, in an effort to strongly encourage lenders to verify a borrower’s ability to repay, while also establishing a presumption of compliance for certain “qualified mortgages.” The Regulatory Relief Act provided relief in connection with mortgages for banks with assets of less than $10 billion, and, as a result, mortgages the Bank makes are now considered to be qualified mortgages if they are held in portfolio for the life of the loan.",

        ". In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which replaces the current “incurred loss” model for recognizing credit losses with an “expected loss” model referred to as the CECL model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Pursuant to an additional FASB accounting standard update, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842),” issued in November 2019, the effective date of CECL was delayed from January 2020 to January 2023 for certain entities, including smaller reporting companies like the Corporation.",
        "On May 8, 2020, four federal banking agencies issued an interagency policy statement on the new CECL methodology. The policy statement harmonizes the agencies' policies on allowance for credit losses with the FASB’s new accounting standards. Specifically, the statement (i) updates concepts and practices from prior policy statements issued in December 2006 and July 2001 and specifies which prior guidance documents are no longer relevant; (ii) describes the appropriate CECL methodology, in light of Topic 326, for determining Allowances for Credit Losses (“ACLs”) on financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures; and (iii) describes how to estimate an ACL for an impaired available-for-sale debt security in line with Topic 326.

In particular, the PPPLF is designed to provide an adequate liquidity source to financial institutions for purposes of funding PPP loans. The federal bank regulatory agencies issued multiple rules throughout 2020 that were designed to provide relief to financial institutions from any adverse regulatory capital or liquidity impacts resulting from the Federal Reserve’s liquidity facilities.

        "The U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. These regulatory programs may require us to install expensive emissions abatement equipment, modify our operational practices and obtain permits for our existing operations, and before commencing construction on a new or modified source of air emissions, such laws may require us to reduce emissions at existing facilities. As a result, we may be required to incur increased capital and operating costs because of these regulations. We could be subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations.",
        "As part of our operations, we utilize or store petroleum products and other substances such as diesel fuel, lubricating oils and hydraulic fluid. We are subject to applicable requirements regarding the storage, use, transportation and disposal of these substances, including the relevant Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure requirements that the EPA imposes on us. ",
        "8",
        "Spills or releases may occur in the course of our operations, and we could incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including those relating to claims for damage or injury to property and persons.",
        "Additionally, some of our operations are located on properties that historically have been used in ways that resulted in the release of contaminants, including hazardous substances, into the environment, and we could be held liable for the remediation of such historical contamination. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.",
        "In addition, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. In the course of our operations, we generate industrial solid wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes.",
        "Our operations may also be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all “major federal actions” significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The granting of a federal permit for a major development project, such as a mining operation, may be considered a “major federal action” that requires review under NEPA. Therefore, our projects may require review and evaluation under NEPA. ",
        "Federal agencies granting permits for our operations also must consider impacts to endangered and threatened species and their habitat under the Endangered Species Act. We also must comply with and are subject to liability under the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for the harming of endangered or threatened species and their habitat. Federal agencies also must consider a project’s impacts on historic or archaeological resources under the National Historic Preservation Act, and we may be required to conduct archaeological surveys of project sites and to avoid or preserve historical areas or artifacts.",
        "State and Local Regulation",
        "Because our operations are located in numerous states, we are also subject to a variety of different state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states in which our projects are located or are being developed have state laws similar to NEPA; thus, our development of new sites or the expansion of existing sites may be subject to comprehensive state environmental reviews even if they are not subject to NEPA. In some cases, the state environmental review may be more stringent than the federal review. Our operations may require state law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations and scenic areas. Some states also have specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining operations, and states may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building and transportation requirements.",
        "As demand for frac sand in the oil and natural gas industry has driven a significant increase in current and expected future production of commercial silica, some local communities have expressed concern regarding silica sand mining operations. These concerns have generally included exposure to ambient silica sand dust, truck traffic, water usage and blasting. In response, certain state and local communities have developed or are in the process of developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize dust from getting airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly curtail the amount of practicable area for mining activities, provide compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining activities and, in some cases, ban issuance of new permits for mining activities. To date, we have not experienced any material impact or disruption to our existing mining operations or planned capacity expansions as a result of these types of concerns.",
        "We have a long history of positive engagement with the communities that surround our existing mining operations. We  believe our relatively stable workforce and strong relationship with our employees help foster good relations with the communities in which we operate. Although additional regulatory requirements could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, we believe our existing operations  may be less likely to be negatively impacted by virtue of our good community relations.",
        "9",
        "Planned expansion of our mining and production capacity in new communities could be more significantly impacted by increased regulatory activity. Difficulty or delays in obtaining or inability to obtain new mining permits or increased costs of compliance with future state and local regulatory requirements could have a material negative impact on our ability to grow our business. In an effort to minimize these risks, we continue to be engaged with local communities in order to grow and maintain strong relationships with residents and regulators.",
        "Costs of Compliance",
        "We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our activities. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory, cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations and the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also increase the cost of the development, construction and operation of our projects and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given project. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property may result from environmental and other impacts of our activities.",
        "The process for performing environmental impact studies and reviews for federal, state and local permits for our operations involves a significant investment of time and monetary resources. We cannot control the permit approval process. We cannot predict whether all permits required for a given project will be granted or whether such permits will be the subject of significant opposition. The denial of a permit essential to a project or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop a project. Significant opposition and delay in the environmental review and permitting process also could impair or delay our ability to develop a project. Additionally, the passage of more stringent environmental laws could impair our ability to develop new operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations We do not expect any material capital expenditures due to current regulatory compliance obligations.",

None of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. Our employees are a cornerstone of our culture and set the tone for a fun, family-friendly atmosphere with attentive service. During the first quarter, as part of managements response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had furloughed a substantial number of hourly employees as well as store management personnel to right-size our operations as the Company transitioned to an off-premise only operating model. As our restaurants reopened, we were able to rehire approximately 50% of furloughed management employees and approximately 60% of furloughed hourly employees.",

        "Our operations are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state, local and international statutes, ordinances and regulations.",
        "U.S. Federal Regulation ",
        "Consumer Lending Laws. Our consumer loan business is subject to the federal Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), and its underlying regulations, known as Regulation Z, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”). These laws require us to provide certain disclosures ",
        "12",
        "to prospective borrowers and protect against unfair credit practices. The principal disclosures required under TILA are intended to promote the informed use of consumer credit. Under TILA, when acting as a lender, we are required to disclose certain material terms related to a credit transaction, including, but not limited to, the annual percentage rate, finance charge, amount financed, total of payments, the number and amount of payments and payment due dates to repay the indebtedness. The FCRA regulates the collection, dissemination and use of consumer information, including consumer credit information. The federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”), prohibits us from discriminating against any credit applicant on the basis of any protected category, such as race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or age, and requires us to notify credit applicants of any action taken on the individual’s credit application. ",
        "Consumer Reports and Information. The use of consumer reports and other personal data used in credit underwriting is governed by the FCRA and similar state laws governing the use of consumer credit information. The FCRA establishes requirements that apply to the use of “consumer reports” and similar data, including certain notifications to consumers where their loan application has been denied because of information contained in their consumer report. The FCRA requires us to promptly update any credit information reported to a credit reporting agency about a consumer and to allow a process by which consumers may inquire about credit information furnished by us to a consumer reporting agency. ",
        "Information-Sharing Laws. We are also subject to the federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which limits the sharing of information with affiliates for marketing purposes and requires us to adopt written guidance and procedures for detecting, preventing and responding appropriately to mitigate identity theft and to adopt various policies and procedures and provide training and materials that address the importance of protecting non-public personal information and aid us in detecting and responding to suspicious activity, including suspicious activity that may suggest a possible identity theft red flag, as appropriate. ",
        "Marketing Laws. Our advertising and marketing activities are subject to several federal laws and regulations including the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”), which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices and false or misleading advertisements in all aspects of our business. As a financial services company, any advertisements related to our products must also comply with the advertising requirements set forth in TILA. Also, any of our telephone marketing activities must comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the “TCPA”) and the Telemarketing Sales Rule (the “TSR”). The TCPA prohibits the use of automatic telephone dialing systems for communications with wireless phone numbers without express consent of the consumer, and the TSR established the Do Not Call Registry and sets forth standards of conduct for all telemarketing. Our advertising and marketing activities are also subject to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, which establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to the source of content. ",
        "Protection of Military Members and Dependents. The Military Lending Act (“MLA”) is a federal law that limits the annual percentage rate to 36% on certain consumer loans made to active duty members of the U.S. military, reservists and members of the National Guard and their immediate families. The MLA’s implementing regulation also contains various disclosure requirements, limitations on renewals and refinancing, as well as restrictions on the use of prepayment penalties, arbitration provisions and certain waivers of rights. The 36% annual percentage rate cap applies to a variety of consumer loan products, including short-term consumer loans. Therefore, due to these rate restrictions, we are unable to offer certain short-term consumer loans to active duty military personnel, active reservists and members of the National Guard and their immediate dependents. Federal law also limits the annual percentage rate on existing loans when the borrower, or spouse of the borrower, becomes an active-duty member of the military during the life of a loan. Pursuant to federal law, the interest rate must be reduced to 6% per year on amounts outstanding during the time in which the service member is on active duty. ",
        "Funds Transfer and Signature Authentication Laws. The consumer loan business is also subject to the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act (“EFTA”), and various other laws, rules and guidelines relating to the procedures and disclosures required in debiting or crediting a debtor’s bank account relating to a consumer loan (i.e., Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) funds transfer). Furthermore, we are subject to various state and federal e-signature rules mandating that certain disclosures be made and certain steps be followed in order to obtain and authenticate e-signatures. ",
        "Debt Collection Practices. We use the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”) as a guide in connection with operating our other collection activities. We are also required to comply with all applicable state collection practices laws. ",
        "Privacy and Security of Non-Public Customer Information. We are also subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security. Under these laws, including the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), we must disclose to consumers our privacy policy and practices, including those policies relating to the sharing of consumers’ nonpublic personal information with third parties. These regulations also require us to ensure that our systems are designed to protect the confidentiality of consumers’ nonpublic personal information. These regulations also dictate certain actions that we must take to notify consumers if their personal information is disclosed in an unauthorized manner. ",
        "Anti-Money Laundering and Economic Sanctions. We are also subject to certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act under which we must maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program covering certain of our business activities. ",
        "13",
        "In addition, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) prohibits us from engaging in financial transactions with specially designated nationals. ",
        "Anticorruption. We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), which generally prohibits companies and their agents or intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. ",
        "CFPB ",
        "In July 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which regulates consumer financial products and services, including consumer loans that we offer. The CFPB has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services, including explicit supervisory authority to examine and require registration of such providers. Pursuant to these powers, the CFPB has examined our lending products, services and practices, and we expect to continue to be examined on a regular basis by the CFPB.",
        "On November 20, 2013, Cash America International, Inc. (“Cash America”), our parent company at the time, consented to the issuance of a Consent Order by the CFPB pursuant to which it agreed, without admitting or denying any of the facts or conclusions made by the CFPB from its 2012 examination of Cash America and us, to pay a civil money penalty of $5 million. The Consent Order relates in part to issues self-disclosed to the CFPB by us, including the making of a limited number of loans to consumers who may have been active-duty members of the military at the time of the loan at rates in excess of the annual percentage rate permitted by the federal Military Lending Act, and for which we made refunds of approximately $33,500, and for certain failures to timely provide and preserve records and information in connection with the CFPB’s examination of us. In addition, as a result of the CFPB’s review, we enhanced and continue to enhance our compliance management system and implemented additional policies and procedures to address the issues identified by the CFPB. ",
        "On July 10, 2017, the CFPB issued a final rule prohibiting the use of mandatory arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions in consumer financial services contracts. On November 1, 2017, President Trump signed a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate pursuant to the Congressional Review Act disapproving the CFPB arbitration rule and blocking it from taking effect. The joint resolution also precludes an agency from reissuing a rule in substantially the same form unless the reissued rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted subsequent to the President signing the joint resolution of disapproval. ",
        "On October 6, 2017, the CFPB issued its final rule entitled “Payday, Vehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans” (the “Small Dollar Rule”), which covers certain loans that we offer. The Small Dollar Rule requires that lenders who make short-term loans and longer-term loans with balloon payments reasonably determine consumers’ ability to repay the loans according to their terms before issuing the loans. The Small Dollar Rule also introduces new limitations on repayment processes for those lenders as well as lenders of other longer-term loans with an annual percentage rate greater than 36 percent that include an ACH authorization or similar payment provision. If a consumer has two consecutive failed payment attempts, the lender must obtain the consumer’s new and specific authorization to make further withdrawals from the consumer’s bank account. For loans covered by the Small Dollar Rule, lenders must provide certain notices to consumers before attempting a first payment withdrawal or an unusual withdrawal and after two consecutive failed withdrawal attempts. On June 7, 2019, the CFPB issued a final rule to set the compliance date for the mandatory underwriting provisions of the Small Dollar Rule to November 19, 2020. On July 7, 2020, the CFPB issued a final rule rescinding the ability to repay (“ATR”) provisions of the Small Dollar Rule along with related provisions, such as the establishment of registered information systems for checking ATR and reporting loan activity.",
        "On January 25, 2019, we consented to the issuance of a Consent Order by the CFPB pursuant to which we agreed, without admitting or denying any of the facts or conclusions, to pay a civil money penalty of $3.2 million. The Consent Order relates to issues self-disclosed to the CFPB in 2014, including failure to provide loan extensions to 308 consumers and debiting approximately 5,500 consumers from the wrong bank account. We remain subject to the restrictions and obligations of the Consent Order, including a prohibition from engaging in certain conduct.",
        "For further discussion of the CFPB and its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry— The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination authority over our U.S. consumer lending business that could have a significant impact on our U.S. business” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.",
        "U.S. State Regulation ",
        "Our consumer lending business is regulated under a variety of enabling state statutes, all of which are subject to change and which may impose significant costs or limitations on the way we conduct or expand our business. As of the date of this report, we offer or arrange consumer loans in 39 states that have specific statutes and regulations that enable us to offer economically viable products. We currently do not offer consumer loans in the remaining states because we do not believe it is economically feasible to operate in ",
        "14",
        "those jurisdictions due to specific statutory or regulatory restrictions, such as interest rate ceilings, caps on the fees that may be charged, or costly operational requirements. However, we may later offer our consumer products or services in any of these states if we believe doing so may become economically viable because of changes in applicable statutes or regulations or if we determine we can broaden our product offerings to operate under existing laws and regulations. ",
        "The scope of state regulation of consumer loans, including the fees and terms of our products and services, varies from state to state. The terms of our products and services vary from state to state in order to comply with the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. In addition, our advertising and marketing activities and disclosures are subject to review under various state consumer protection laws and other applicable laws and regulations. The states with laws that specifically regulate our consumer products and services may limit the principal amount of a consumer loan and set maximum fees or interest rates customers may be charged. Some states also limit a customer’s ability to renew a short-term consumer loan and require various disclosures to consumers. State statutes often specify minimum and maximum maturity dates for short-term consumer loans such as ours and, in some cases, specify mandatory cooling-off periods between transactions. Our collection activities regarding past due amounts may be subject to consumer protection laws and state regulations relating to debt collection practices. In addition, some states require certain disclosures or content to accompany our advertising or marketing materials. Also, some states require us to report short-term consumer loan activity to state-wide databases and restrict the number and/or principal amount of loans a consumer may have outstanding at any particular time or over the course of a particular period of time. ",
        "In Texas, where we offer our CSO program, we comply with the jurisdiction’s Credit Services Organization Act and related regulations. These laws generally define the services that we can provide to consumers and require us to provide a contract to the customer outlining our services and the cost of those services to the customer. In addition, these laws may require additional disclosures to consumers and may require us to be registered with the jurisdiction and/or be bonded. ",
        "We must also comply with state restrictions on the use of lead providers. Over the past few years, several states have taken actions that have caused us to discontinue the use of lead providers in those states. Other states may propose or enact similar restrictions on lead providers in the future. ",
        "Over the last few years, legislation that prohibits or severely restricts our consumer loan products and services has been introduced or adopted in a number of states. As a result, we have altered or ceased making consumer loans in certain states, in compliance with the new statutes. We regularly monitor proposed legislation or regulations that could affect our business. "

The federal banking agencies also issued guidance to encourage banks to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19 by providing that short-term modifications made in response to COVID-19, such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant related to the loans in which the borrower is less than 30 days past due on its contractual payments at the time a modification is implemented is not a TDR.  The Bank is applying this guidance to qualifying COVID-19 modifications.

The loans are provided through participating financial institutions, such as the Bank, that process loan applications and service the loans and are eligible for SBA repayment and loan forgiveness if the borrower meets the PPP conditions. The application period for a PPP loan closed on August 8, 2020. The SBA began approving PPP forgiveness applications and remitting forgiveness payments to PPP lenders on October 2, 2020. The CAA 2021 which was signed into law on December 27, 2020, renews and extends the PPP until March 31, 2021.  As a result, as a participating lender, the Bank began originating PPP loans again in January 2021 and will continue to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related to the PPP.",
        "Pursuant to the CARES Act, the federal banking agencies authorities adopted in April 2020 an interim rule, effective until the earlier of the termination of the coronavirus emergency declaration by the President and December 31, 2020, to (i) reduce the minimum CBLR  from 9% to 8% percent and (ii) give community banks two-quarter grace period to satisfy such ratio if such ratio falls out of compliance by no more than 1%. Effective October 1, 2020, the final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies authorities lowers the CBLR as set forth in the interim rule and provides a gradual transition back to the prior level. Under the final rule the  CBLR was 8% for 2020, and will be 8.5% for 2021, and 9% beginning January 1, 2022. The final rule also retains the grace period. A community banking organization that falls below the CBRL will still be deemed to be well capitalized during a two-quarter grace period so long as the banking organization maintains a CBRL greater than 7.5% during 2021, and greater than 8% thereafter.",

        "Derivative instruments not related to mortgage banking activities primarily relate to interest rate swap agreements accounted for as cash flow hedges. To qualify for hedge accounting, derivatives must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract. If derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value adjustments related to the effective portion are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction is reflected in earnings. Ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are reflected in earnings as they occur. Actual cash receipts and/or payments and related accruals on derivatives related to hedges are recorded as adjustments to the interest income or interest expense associated with the hedged item. During the life of the hedge, the Company formally assesses whether derivatives designated as hedging instruments continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of hedged items. If it is determined that a hedge has ceased to be highly effective, the Company will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. At such time, previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged item are reversed into current earnings and the derivative instrument is reclassified to a trading position recorded at fair value. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings, in noninterest income.",

        "The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure to variability in interest-related cash outflows attributable to changes in forecasted LIBOR-based borrowings and brokered deposits. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. The hedged item is the LIBOR portion of the series of future adjustable rate borrowings and deposits over the term of the interest rate swap. Accordingly, changes to the amount of interest payment cash flows for the hedged transactions attributable to a change in credit risk are excluded from management’s assessment of hedge effectiveness. The Company tests for hedging effectiveness on a quarterly basis. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The Company has not recorded any hedge ineffectiveness since inception.  The Company has master netting agreements with derivative dealers with which it does business, but reflects gross assets and liabilities as other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.",

        "Our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business, and these officers and key personnel may not remain with us in the future.",
        "Our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to hire and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. In particular, we are highly dependent on certain of our executive officers, particularly our President and Chief Executive Officer, Ann G. Fox, and the Chief Operating Officer, David Crombie. These individuals possess extensive expertise, talent, and leadership, and they are critical to our success. The diminution or loss of the services of these individuals, or other integral key personnel affiliated with entities that we acquire in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, we may not be able to enforce all of the provisions in any employment agreement we have entered into with certain of our executive officers, and such employment agreements may not otherwise be effective in retaining such individuals. In addition, we may not be able to retain key employees of entities that we acquire in the future, which may impact our ability to successfully integrate or operate the assets we acquire.",
        "28",
        "We may be unable to employ, or maintain the employment of, a sufficient number of key employees, technical personnel, and other skilled and qualified workers.",
        "The delivery of our services and products requires personnel with specialized skills and experience, including personnel who can perform physically demanding work, and our success depends, in large part, upon our ability to employ and retain key employees, technical personnel, and other skilled and qualified workers. To attract and retain qualified employees, we must compensate them at market levels. Recent cost-cutting measures across the organization include decreases in cash and equity compensation for our employees, which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain our liquidity and competitive position, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. Workers may choose to pursue employment with our competitors or in fields that offer a more desirable work environment as a result of the volatility in the oilfield service industry and the demanding nature of our work. The right-sizing of our and our competitors’ labor force, as well as a significant decrease in the wages paid by us or our competitors as a result of reduced industry demand, has resulted in a reduction of the available skilled labor force to service the energy industry. To the extent that there is an increase in demand for our products or services, there is no assurance that the availability of skilled labor will improve. If we are unable to employ and retain skilled workers, our capacity and profitability could be diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.",

The FDA has continued to monitor these matters, and on February 6, 2019 issued a “Letter to Health Care Providers” and a public statement detailing updated medical device report (MDR) data involving BIA-ALCL, and stating that the data and published information reviewed to date suggest that patients with breast implants have an increased risk of BIA-ALCL. The FDA states: “Over time, we have strengthened our understanding of this condition. In 2016, the World Health Organization designated breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) as a rare T-cell lymphoma that can develop following breast implants. The exact number of cases remains difficult to determine due to significant limitations in world-wide reporting and lack of global implant sales data. At this time, most data suggest that BIA-ALCL occurs more frequently following implantation of breast implants with textured surfaces rather than those with smooth surfaces.” The FDA noted it does not recommend prophylactic breast implant removal in a patient without symptoms or other abnormality.",

The primary underpinning of our pay philosophy is to award equity-based pay to all eligible employees to ensure that when we deliver for patients and for shareholders, everyone shares in the upside growth. Our practice, therefore, has been to award initial equity grants to all new hires, in addition to our comprehensive annual equity program. Total employee compensation packages include market-competitive pay (with the opportunity to receive above-market rewards), broad-based grants of equity-based awards, healthcare benefits, retirement savings options, and matching contributions.",

In addition, a company may qualify as a non-accelerated filer if it has (1) annual revenues of less than $100 million in the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available and (2) a public float of less than $700 million as of the last business day of its second fiscal quarter.",

We undertook to promote transparency by publishing our workforce demographic data internally and to increase thoughtful discussions across the Company, including holding unconscious bias training for our employees, further expanding efforts to recruit under-represented groups through referrals and by expanding beyond the traditional networks from which we recruited.

We have also directed our talent acquisition team to take the further step of interviewing at least one woman and/or person of color for every role we hire for. These efforts yielded results. At the end of 2020, we increased the percent of under-represented employees in the U.S. to over 49%, with over 4% increases in each of the percent of women and the percent of people of color. Additionally, in 2020, we completed a comprehensive employee pay equity survey for our U.S. employees, with outside advisors using regression models to determine that women and people of color at Rapid7 were not paid less for the same job, level, and location, controlling for pay differentiators such as performance and tenure/experience.

While capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress.

The accords recognized that bank assets for the purpose of the capital ratio calculations needed to be weighted (the theory being that riskier assets should require more capital) and that off-balance-sheet credit exposures needed to be factored in the calculations.  Following the global financial crisis, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the BCBS, announced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known as Basel III, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis.",
        "The Basel III Rule.  ",
        "In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies approved implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in pertinent part, and, at the same time, promulgated rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Rule”).  In contrast to capital requirements historically, which were in the form of guidelines, Basel III was released in the form of binding regulations by each of the regulatory agencies.  The Basel III Rule increased the required quantity and quality of capital and required more detailed categories of risk weighting of riskier, more opaque assets.  For nearly every class of assets, the Basel III Rule requires a more complex, detailed, and calibrated assessment of risk in the calculation of risk weightings.  The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to most bank and savings and loan holding companies.  The Company and Bank are each subject to the Basel III Rule as described below.",
        "Not only did the Basel III Rule increase most of the required minimum capital ratios in effect prior to January 1, 2015, but in requiring that forms of capital be of higher quality to absorb loss, it also introduced the concept of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus, retained e",
        "arnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments.",
        "The Basel III Rule also changed the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (primarily non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that meets certain requirements) and Tier 2 Capital (primarily other types of preferred stock and subordinated debt, subject to limitations).",

For example, a banking organization that is well capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, rollover or renew brokered deposits.  Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations.  For example, the Federal Reserve’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities, or securities trading activities.

The FDIC’s rules reduced assessment rates on all FDIC-insured financial institutions but imposed a surcharge on banks with assets of $10 billion or more until the DRR reached 1.35% and provided assessment credits to banks with assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their assessments that contribute to the increase of the DRR to 1.35%.  The DRR reached 1.36% as of September 30, 2018, exceeding the statutory required minimum DRR of 1.35%.  As a result, the FDIC provided assessment credits to banks, like the Bank, with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the DRR between 1.15% and 1.35%.  The FDIC applied the small bank credits for quarterly assessment periods beginning July 1, 2019.  However, the DRR then fell to 1.30% in 2020 as a result of extraordinary insured deposit growth caused by an unprecedented inflow of more than $1 trillion in estimated insured deposits in the first half of 2020, primarily resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Notwithstanding the decrease in the DRR to 1.30%, the FDIC determined not to cease the small bank credits and waived the requirement that the DRR be at least 1.35% for full remittance of the remaining assessment credits.  The FDIC refunded all small bank credits as of September 30, 2020.  The FDIC’s rules also changed the methodology used to determine risk-based assessment rates for established banks with less than $10 billion in assets to better ensure that banks taking on greater risks pay more for deposit insurance than banks that take on less risk.",

The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption, and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware.  A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack.  If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.",
        "State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations.  For example, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements.  Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements.  We expect this trend of increased activity and changes at the state level to continue.",

We employ an in-depth approach that leverages people, processes, and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls.  In addition, we employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats.  Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyber-attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures.",

We regularly conduct cybersecurity risk assessments, regularly engage with the Board or appropriate committees on cybersecurity matters, routinely update our incident response plans based on emerging threats, periodically practice implementation of incident response plans across applicable departments and train officers and employees to detect and report suspicious activity.  Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat, and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet and digital banking and other technology-based products and services, by us and our consumers.

        "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, state and federal regulatory authorities have temporarily loosened or waived certain regulatory requirements in order to increase the availability of telehealth services for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. For example, many state governors issued executive orders permitting physicians and other health care professionals to practice in their state without any additional licensure or by using a temporary, expedited or abbreviated licensure or registration process so long as they hold a valid license in another state. In addition, changes were made to the Medicare and Medicaid programs (through waivers and other regulatory authority) to increase access to telehealth services by, among other things, increasing reimbursement, permitting the enrollment of out of state providers and eliminating prior authorization requirements. It is uncertain how long these COVID-19 related regulatory changes will remain in effect and whether they will continue beyond this public health emergency period. A return to the status quo could have a materially negative impact on any commercial agreements we have entered into during 2020 or any time before the termination of the COVID-19 public health emergency. For example, we may be required to change our operations or terminate certain services when the government reinstates certain healthcare regulatory requirements or restrictions that were in place before the COVID-19 public health emergency, including certain restrictions on the reimbursement of telehealth visits to Medicare beneficiaries and state licensure requirements for healthcare professionals who practice medicine across state lines.",

        "Under CLIA, a laboratory is any facility which performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment or assessment of health. CLIA regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring they be certified by the federal government and comply with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality, and proficiency requirements intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable, and timely. Laboratories must register and list their tests with CMS, the agency that oversees the CLIA program. CLIA compliance and certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill for services provided to governmental payer program beneficiaries and for many private payers. CLIA is user-fee funded. Therefore, all costs of administering the program must be covered by the regulated facilities, including certification and survey costs.",
        "Clinical laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards and may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than laboratories performing fewer complex tests. In addition, a laboratory, like the one which performs our Omics services, that is certified as “high complexity” under CLIA, may develop, manufacture, validate, and use proprietary tests referred to as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs. CLIA requires full validation, including accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, and establishment of a reference range for any LDT used in clinical testing.",
        "In addition to the federal certification requirements under CLIA, certain states require clinical laboratories to maintain a state license. State licensure authorities typically regulate the day-to-day operations of a clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of its personnel and quality control. Certain states may also mandate proficiency testing, which requires the clinical laboratory to verify the accuracy of any test or procedure it performs. In addition, certain states require out-of-state laboratories to be licensed if they accept specimens from those states. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law. In some cases, state licensure programs substitute for the federal CLIA program. In other instances, the state’s regulations may be in addition to the CLIA program. If a laboratory is out of compliance with state laws or regulations governing licensed laboratories, penalties for violation vary from state to state but may include suspension, limitation, revocation or annulment of the license, assessment of financial penalties or fines, or imprisonment.",

        "The FDA regulates the sale and distribution in interstate commerce of medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, including in vitro diagnostic devices, reagents, and instruments used to perform diagnostic testing. Devices must undergo premarket review by the FDA prior to commercialization unless the device is of a type exempted from such review by statute, regulation, or pursuant to the FDA’s exercise of enforcement discretion. Although historically the FDA has not exercised its authority to actively regulate the development and use of LDTs, which are tests that are designed, manufactured, validated, and used within a single laboratory, more recently, the FDA has issued warning letters to certain genomics labs for illegally marketing genetic tests that claim to predict patients’ responses to specific medications, noting that the FDA has not created a legal “carve-out” for LDTs and retains discretion to take action when appropriate, such as when certain genomics tests raise significant public health concerns. As manufacturers develop more complex genetic tests, it is likely that the FDA will more actively regulate LDTs in the future, which will impose greater burdens on laboratories to obtain the necessary premarket notification or approval from the FDA as well as comply with applicable post-market regulatory obligations. Such requirements will likely delay market entry and will require more resources and time commitment from clinical laboratories in the in vitro diagnostic space. ",
        "In October 2014, the FDA issued draft guidance documents stating that the FDA intends to change its policy and describing an approach to regulating LDTs using a risk-based, phased-in approach. In November 2016, the FDA stated that it had decided to delay finalizing its draft guidance on regulating LDTs, and it would be seeking input from the new presidential administration and Congress on the subject. Based on the request of stakeholders and the significant amount of feedback to the 2014 Draft Guidance, in January 2017, the FDA issued a Discussion Paper on LDTs in which it announced that it would not issue a final guidance on the oversight of LDTs and provided a prospective oversight framework that focuses on new and significantly modified high and moderate risk LDTs. Subject to certain limitations, the proposed focused oversight appears to exempt a wide range of LDTs from FDA's oversight, which include, but are not limited to, previously marketed LDTs (these “grandfathered” LDTs would still be subject to adverse event reporting), traditional LDTs, and low risk LDTs (also subject to adverse event reporting). In the Discussion Paper, the FDA proposes a risk-based, phased in approach for premarket review of new and significantly modified LDTs and such premarket review would not be duplicative of CMS’s post-market oversight of laboratory operations or clinical utility determinations. The FDA also proposes to leverage existing CMS/CLIA requirements related to quality systems, while focusing its assessment on FDA Quality System requirements not covered by CLIA, and expanding third party premarket review, including coordination with a range of programs, including New York’s Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program. ",
        "Recently, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, announced rescission of guidance and other informal issuances of FDA regarding premarket review of LDT absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, stating that, absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, those seeking approval or clearance of, or an emergency use authorization, for an LDT may nonetheless ",

However, laboratories opting to use LDTs without FDA premarket review or authorization would not be eligible for liability protection under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or the PREP Act. While this action by HHS is expected to reduce the regulatory burden on clinical laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) that develop LDTs, it is unclear how this action as well as future legislation by federal and state governments and FDA will impact the industry, including our business and that of our customers. HHS’ rescission policy may change over time. Congress or the Biden administration could also enact legislation restricting LDTs. Any restrictions on LDTs by the FDA, HHS, Congress, or state regulatory authorities may decrease the demand for our products.",
        "That said, based on the November 2018 FDA Statement and warning letters issued by the FDA in 2019 to certain genomics labs for illegally marketing genetic test that claims to predict patients’ responses to specific medications, the FDA may increase its scrutiny and regulation of certain LDTs.

Many Class I devices are exempt from premarket regulation; however, some Class I devices require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.",

Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices are accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, although some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirements. Premarket notifications are subject to user fees, unless a specific exemption applies. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared 510(k) device or a pre-amendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a premarket approval, or PMA, application. In determining substantial equivalence, the FDA assesses whether the proposed device has the same intended use and technical characteristic as the predicate device, or whether the proposed device has different technological characteristics, and the information submitted in the premarket notification demonstrates the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. The FDA may request additional information, including clinical data. Under the Medical Device User Fee Amendment of 2012, the FDA’s performance goal for reviewing a 510(k) submission is 90 days, but the FDA’s review of the premarket notification can take significantly longer if the FDA requests additional information or raises new questions during the review process. If the FDA determines that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device(s), the subject device may be marketed upon grant of FDA clearance. If a manufacturer obtains a 510(k) clearance for its device and then makes a modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, or a major modification in the intended use of the device, a new premarket notification must be submitted and cleared by the FDA.",
        "Class III devices are those deemed by FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as those that are life-sustaining or life-supporting and for which reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness cannot be assured solely by the general controls and special controls described above. Some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA require the FDA’s clearance of a premarket notification in order to be marketed. However, most Class III devices are required to undergo the PMA process in which the manufacturer must demonstrate reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. A PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence, typically extensive preclinical and clinical trial data, and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. PMA applications (and supplemental PMA applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees than are 510(k) premarket notifications. Some PMA applications are exempt from a user fee, for example, a small business’s first PMA.",
        "- 20 -",
        "If a new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) premarket notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification process. This process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk and requires PMA or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.",
        "Even if regulatory approval or clearance of a device is granted, the FDA continues to impose limitations on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted, and the device remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved by the FDA. Device manufacturers must register their facilities and list their devices with the FDA within 30 days of an establishment beginning an activity or putting a device into commercial distribution. A device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of some of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which covers quality management, design controls, production and process controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, shipping, complaint handling, and adverse event reporting. Device manufacturers must submit to the FDA medical device reports for deaths, serious injuries, and certain malfunctions and report certain field corrections and product recalls or removals. Some manufacturers also may be subject to post-market surveillance regulations. Medical device establishments, including their facility records and manufacturing processes, are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA.",
        "Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: public warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, delays in or denial of 510(k) clearance or PMA applications for new products, challenges to existing 510(k) clearances or PMA applications, and a recommendation by the FDA to disallow a device manufacturer from entering into government contracts. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed. If a supplier fails to maintain compliance with a device manufacturer’s quality requirements, the manufacturer may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result.",
        "HIPAA and HITECH",
        "Under the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, the HHS issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by healthcare providers and other covered entities. Three principal regulations with which we are required to comply have been issued in final form under HIPAA: privacy regulations, security regulations, and standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions. The privacy and security regulations were extensively amended in 2013 to incorporate requirements from the HITECH Act.",
        "The privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of protected health information by healthcare providers and other covered entities. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her protected health information maintained by a covered entity, including the right to access or amend certain records containing protected health information, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of protected health information. The security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The HITECH Act, among other things, makes certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards applicable to business associates of covered entities, and established certain protected health information security breach notification requirements. A covered entity must notify affected individual(s) and the HHS when there is a breach of unsecured protected health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” that covered entities and their business associates must meet and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing protected health information. HIPAA also governs patient access to laboratory test reports. Effective October 6, 2014, individuals (or their personal representatives, as applicable), have the right to access test reports directly from clinical laboratories and to direct that copies of those test reports be transmitted to persons or entities designated by the individual.",
        "These laws contain significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information. Additionally, to the extent that we submit electronic healthcare claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, payments to us may be delayed or denied.",
        "- 21 -",
        "In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are several state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to our operations. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. Massachusetts, for example, has a state law that protects the privacy and security of personal information of Massachusetts residents that is more prescriptive than HIPAA. Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results. In some cases, we are prohibited from conducting certain tests without a certification of patient consent by the physician ordering the test. For example, California recently enacted the Genetic Information Privacy Act, California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, and California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which will increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to personally identifying and genetic information we may collect about consumers in California. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security, could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.",
        "Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws",
        "In the United States, there are various fraud and abuse laws with which we must comply and we are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including CMS, other divisions of the HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. We also may be subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws.",
        "In the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for patient referrals for, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any healthcare item or service reimbursable under a governmental payer program. Courts have stated that a financial arrangement may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, consulting fees, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the HHS issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions, which, if met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these safe harbor provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. That said, non-compliance with all the requirements of a safe harbor can increase the risk of the transaction or arrangement and may increase the risk of government scrutiny. Many states also have anti-kickback statutes, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers.",
        "In addition, federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.",
        "HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.",
        "- 22 -",
        "In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a governmental payer program. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. The costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance.",

The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.",
        "In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offence. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act 2010 faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.",
        "Federal and State Physician Self-Referral Prohibitions",
        "Under a federal law directed at “self-referral,” commonly known as the “Stark Law,” there are prohibitions, with certain exceptions, on referrals for certain designated health services, including laboratory services, that are covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have an investment or ownership interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, an entity performing the tests. The prohibition also extends to payment for any testing referred in violation of the Stark Law. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $25,820 per submitted claim, subject to periodic adjustments for inflation, and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the False Claims Act (FCA). The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $172,137 for a circumvention scheme. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of the various statutes, including the Stark Law, can be considered a violation of the federal FCA, as described further below, based on the contention that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. A determination of liability under the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Bills submitted in violation of the Stark Law may not be paid by Medicare or Medicaid, and any person collecting any amounts with respect to any such prohibited bill is obligated to refund such amounts. Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals.",

        "Physician Payment Sunshine Act",
        "The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, requires applicable manufacturers and certain distributors of prescription drugs, devices, biologics or other medical supplies available for coverage by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Secretary of HHS: (i) payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third-party as directed by that entity, to physicians and teaching hospitals or to third parties on behalf of physicians or teaching hospitals; effective January 1, 2022, reporting on payments and transfers of value made in the previous year to covered recipients will be expanded to include physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives; and (ii) physician ownership (including immediate family ownership) and investment interests in the entity. The statute requires the federal government to make reported information available to the public starting September 2014, which it has. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of $11,766 per failure up to an aggregate of $176,495 per year. Knowingly failing to submit the required information may result in a civil money penalty of up to $1,176,638. Such failures may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Additionally, there are criminal penalties if an entity intentionally makes false statements in such reports. Upon commercialization of covered products, we will be subject to the Sunshine Act and the information we disclose may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs. Additionally, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.",
        "Corporate Practice of Medicine",
        "Numerous states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. Many states also have fee splitting laws that prohibit splitting or sharing medical professional fees with other persons or entities who did not perform the medical services unless an exception applies. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. For example, California’s Medical Board has indicated that determining what diagnostic tests are appropriate for a particular condition and taking responsibility for the ultimate overall care of the patient, including providing treatment options available to the patient, would constitute the unlicensed practice of medicine if performed by an unlicensed person. Violation of these corporate practice of medicine laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against us and/or the physician through licensure proceedings. Typically, such laws are only applicable to entities that conduct business or interact with patients located in that state. Additionally, claims that violate the corporate practice of medicine or other FDA or healthcare laws may increase our liability under the federal False Claims Act and comparable state false claims laws.",
        "Healthcare Reform",
        "The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted several legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our business. In the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in the health care system with the stated goal of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. For example, the ACA contains certain measures that may be significant for our business. The ACA includes, among other things, provisions regarding initiatives to revise Medicare payment methodologies; the coordination and promotion of research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures; and initiatives to promote quality indicators in payment methodologies. The ACA also includes an annual excise tax on device manufacturers of 2.3% of the price for which manufacturers sell their devices. The excise tax was on a 4-year moratorium for calendar years 2016 through 2019. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 H.R. 1865 (Pub.L.116-94), signed into law on December 20, 2019, repealed the medical device excise tax previously imposed by Section 4191 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the \"Code\"), for sales of medical devices after December 31, 2019.",
        "There have been other health reform measures taken since the enactment of the ACA. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction (known as sequestration) to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, beginning April 1, 2013, which will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Furthermore, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, increased the statute of limitations for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three years to five years.",

We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the ACA, including as a result of executive orders and legislative actions. The impact of those legislative and regulatory changes on us and potential effect on the participants in the health care system as a whole is currently unknown. But, any changes to the ACA are likely to have an impact on our results of operations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.",

WaterStone Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the WDFI and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s deposit insurance fund and depositors, and not for the protection of security holders.  WaterStone Bank also is regulated to a lesser extent by the Federal Reserve Board, governing reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters.  WaterStone Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.",
        "Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; determine the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees. Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors. These ratings are inherently subjective and the receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution. A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as WaterStone Bank or its holding company, from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches.",
        "In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network.",
        "As a savings and loan holding company, Waterstone Financial is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.  It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board.  Waterstone Financial is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.",

A Wisconsin savings bank that fails to meet this qualified thrift lender test becomes subject to certain operating restrictions otherwise applicable only to commercial banks. At December 31, 2020, WaterStone Bank maintained 89.3% of its assets in qualified thrift investments and therefore met the qualified thrift lender requirement.",

The activity regulations provide that state banks that meet applicable minimum capital requirements would be permitted to engage in certain activities that are not permissible for national banks, including certain real estate and securities activities conducted through subsidiaries.

Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 1.5 to 30 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may increase or decrease the range of assessments uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base assessment rate without notice and comment rulemaking.  The existing system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution’s aggregate deposits.",

If the WDFI determines that the financial condition, history, management or earning prospects of a savings bank are not adequate, the WDFI may require a higher minimum capital level for the savings bank. If a Wisconsin savings bank’s capital ratio falls below the required level, the WDFI may direct the savings bank to adhere to a specific written plan established by the WDFI to correct the savings bank’s capital deficiency, as well as a number of other restrictions on the savings bank’s operations, including a prohibition on the payment of dividends. At December 31, 2020, WaterStone Bank’s capital to assets ratio, as calculated under Wisconsin law, was 17.13%.",
        "Federal Law and Regulation. Federal regulations require Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards:  a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.",
        "Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings.  Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital.  Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries.  Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital.  Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt.  Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values.  Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities).  WaterStone Bank exercised its AOCI opt-out election.  Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.",
        "In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset.  Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk.  For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential real estate loans, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.",
        "In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.  The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.",
        "In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, including the bank’s exposure to interest rate risk.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary due to a determination that an institution’s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of particular circumstances.",
        "Legislation enacted in May 2018 required the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, to establish a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8 to 10% of average total consolidated assets for qualifying institutions with assets of less than $10 billion.  Institutions with capital meeting the specified requirements and electing to follow the alternative framework are deemed to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements.  A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio on its quarterly call report.",

        "Section 4012 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020 required that the community bank leverage ratio be temporarily lowered to 8%.  The federal regulators issued a rule implementing the lower ratio effective April 23, 2020.  The rule also established a two-quarter grace period for a qualifying institution whose leverage ratio falls below the 8% community bank leverage ratio requirement so long as the bank maintains a leverage ratio of 7% or greater.  Another rule was issued to transition back to the 9% community bank leverage ratio by increasing the ratio to 8.5% for calendar year 2021 and 9% thereafter.",

In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder.",
        "Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action",
        "Federal bank regulatory authorities are required to take \"prompt corrective action\" with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the statute establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Under the regulations, a bank is deemed to be (i) \"well capitalized\" if it has total risk-based capital of 10.0% or more, has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, has a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or more and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or more, and is not subject to any written capital order or directive; (ii) \"adequately capitalized\" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or more, a Tier 1 leveraged capital ratio of 4.0% or more and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or more, and does not meet the definition of \"well capitalized\"; (iii) \"undercapitalized\" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio that is less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%; (iv) \"significantly undercapitalized\" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0% and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) \"critically undercapitalized\" if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.",
        "Federal law and regulations also specify circumstances under which a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an institution classified as less than well capitalized to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized).",
        "The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may order savings banks that have insufficient capital to take corrective actions. For example, a savings bank that is categorized as “undercapitalized” is subject to growth limitations and is required to submit a capital restoration plan, and a holding company that controls such a savings bank is required to guarantee that the savings bank complies with the restoration plan. A “significantly undercapitalized” savings bank may be subject to additional restrictions. Savings banks deemed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to be “critically undercapitalized” would be subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.",
        "At December 31, 2020, WaterStone Bank was considered well-capitalized with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 21.44%, Tier 1 leverage ratio of 16.62%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 21.44% and a total risk based capital ratio of 22.52%.",
        "The previously referenced final rule that establishes an elective community bank leverage ratio provides that a qualifying institution whose tier 1 capital equals or exceeds the specified community bank leverage ratio and opts into that framework will be considered well capitalized for prompt corrective action purposes.",

In addition, prior WDFI approval is required before dividends exceeding 50% of net profits for any calendar year may be declared and before a stock dividend may be declared out of retained earnings.  Under WDFI regulations, a Wisconsin savings bank which has converted from mutual to stock form also is prohibited from paying a dividend on its capital stock if the payment causes the regulatory capital of the savings bank to fall below the amount required for its liquidation account.",
        "The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the authority to prohibit WaterStone Bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of WaterStone Bank.

The exact amount of assets a savings bank is required to maintain as liquid assets is set by the WDFI, but generally ranges from 4% to 15% of the savings bank’s average daily balance of net withdrawable accounts plus short-term borrowings (the “Required Liquidity Ratio”). At December 31, 2020, WaterStone Bank’s Required Liquidity Ratio was 8.0%, and WaterStone Bank was in compliance with this requirement.  In addition, 50% of the liquid assets maintained by a Wisconsin savings bank must consist of “primary liquid assets,” which are defined to include securities issued by the United States Government, United States Government agencies, or the state of Wisconsin or a subdivision thereof, and cash.  At December 31, 2020, WaterStone Bank was in compliance with this requirement.",

Checking accounts, NOW accounts, Super NOW checking accounts, and certain other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to Regulation D reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits (including certain money market deposit accounts) at a savings institution.  However, effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero, thereby effectively eliminating the requirements.  The Federal Reserve Board took that action due to a change in its approach to monetary policy; it has indicated that it has no plans to re-impose reserve requirements but could in the future if conditions warrant.",

        "Federal Law and Regulation.  Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act govern transactions between an insured savings bank, such as WaterStone Bank, and any of its affiliates, including Waterstone Financial. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted Regulation W, which comprehensively implements and interprets Sections 23A and 23B, in part by codifying prior Federal Reserve Board interpretations under Sections 23A and 23B.",
        "An affiliate of a savings bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the savings bank. A subsidiary of a savings bank that is not also a depository institution or a “financial subsidiary” under federal law is not treated as an affiliate of the savings bank for the purposes of Sections 23A and 23B; however, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the discretion to treat subsidiaries of a savings bank as affiliates on a case-by-case basis. Sections 23A and 23B limit the extent to which a savings bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such savings bank’s capital stock and surplus, and limit all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions. Further, most loans and other extensions of credit by a savings bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the loan amounts, depending on the type of collateral. In addition, any affiliate transaction by a savings bank must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the savings bank as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate, and be consistent with safe and sound banking practices.",
        "A savings bank’s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of more than 10% of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider’s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation O thereunder. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider’s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, (which is generally 15% of capital and surplus).  Aggregate loans by a savings bank to its insiders and insiders’ related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the savings bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer’s children and certain loans secured by the officer’s primary residence, may not exceed the greater of $25,000 or 2.5% of the savings bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, but in no event more than $100,000. Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the savings bank, with any interested director not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider’s related interests, would exceed either $500,000 or the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the savings bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Generally, such loans must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and must not present more than a normal risk of collectability.",

Consistent with these requirements, the Bank offered employees special terms for home mortgage loans on their principal residences. Effective April 1, 2006, this program was discontinued for new loan originations.

In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund a proposed dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition.  The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff, to provide opportunity for supervisory review and possible objection, prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred.

Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquiror has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution.

Some of these protocols included, but not limited to, enhanced facility cleanings, reconfiguration of the workplace to allow for social distancing, providing our employees personal protective equipment, the implementation of a daily health screen prior to going in to the facilities, and comprehensive training for employees on these new protocols. The Company also established new initiatives to aid employees, such as a Temporary Emergency Paid Leave Program that provided employees with up to 120 hours of additional paid time off to assist with dependent care needs related to COVID-19, and $250 a week in pay premiums for frontline workers to help defray additional costs incurred while working during the initial stages of the pandemic.

It is possible that at some time in the future the CFPB could propose and adopt rules making such lending services materially less profitable or impractical, which may impact finance loans or other products that the Company offers.",

As a result, the Company paid dividends of $0.20 per share for the third and fourth quarters of 2018 and the first and second quarters of 2019.",

The Interim Policy also prohibits these banks from implementing share purchase programs, except to make share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock related to employee stock ownership plans.",
        "As a result of the Interim Policy, the Company would have been prohibited from paying a dividend or implementing share repurchase programs in the third quarter of 2020; however, in July 2020, the Company announced that the Federal Reserve Board had approved certain exceptions to the Interim Policy and that the Company was permitted to pay a dividend and continue its share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2020. In August 2020, the Company announced that it had substantially exhausted the amount of shares the Company was permitted to repurchase under the exception to the Interim Policy and that the Company expected to repurchase an immaterial number of shares remaining under the exception approval.",
        "Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Board extended the Interim Policy through the first quarter of 2021. As a result of the extension of the Interim Policy, the Company was prohibited from paying a dividend in fourth quarter of 2020 and, unless the Company obtains an exception from the Federal Reserve Board, will be prohibited from paying a dividend in the first quarter of 2021. Further, consistent with the Interim Policy, the Company may continue to repurchase a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the amount of share issuances related to the Company’s expensed employee compensation through the first quarter of 2021.",
        "It is uncertain whether the Federal Reserve will extend the Interim Policy in its present form beyond the first quarter of 2021. If it does so, the foregoing restrictions on dividends and share repurchases would continue.",

        "Diversity and inclusion. As a franchisor, human capital development and opportunity are foundational elements of our business model. Diversity and inclusion permeates our networks as we offer motivated entrepreneurs in over 110 countries and territories the opportunity to be successful small business owners in real estate. Moreover, we have been a leader in expanding opportunities for women within real estate since our founding almost 50 years ago. In our early days, one of the keys to our initial success was an intentional decision to target women to join our RE/MAX network as real estate agents, which helped create professional opportunities for women in a persistently male-dominated industry at the time. Through the years, we have made leadership opportunities for women a priority within our organization. For example, in the history of the Company, two of our five CEOs were women, and today, two of our five executive officers and five of our 12 board members are female. Globally, approximately 46% of our RE/MAX franchises have at least one female owner and 52% of our agents are women, as of December 31, 2020. We have an ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion and continue to expand our efforts around this important topic. To ensure our affiliates as well as our employees are informed, educated and engaged, we infuse education on diversity and inclusion at key Company events and routinely promote available educational resources. RE/MAX has partnered with multiple industry advocacy groups that promote diversity and equality in homeownership. These partnerships include providing financial support in their efforts, participating in panel discussions at their events, attending national and chapter educational sessions, and much more. ",
        "Seasonality ",
        "The residential housing market is seasonal, with transactional activity in the U.S. and Canada typically peaking in the second and third quarter of each year. Our results of operations are somewhat affected by these seasonal trends. Our Adjusted EBITDA margins are often lower in the first and fourth quarters due primarily to the impact of lower broker fees and other revenue as a result of lower overall sales volume, as well as higher selling, operating and administrative expenses in the first quarter for expenses incurred in connection with the RE/MAX annual convention. ",
        "Government Regulation ",
        "Franchise Regulation. The sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws, as well as by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosures to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states require registration or disclosure by franchisors in connection with franchise offers and sales. Several states also have “franchise relationship laws” or “business opportunity laws” that limit the ability of the franchisor to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. The states with relationship or other statutes governing the termination of franchises include Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. Some franchise relationship statutes require a mandated notice period for termination; some require a notice and cure period; and some require that the franchisor demonstrate good cause for termination. Although we believe that our franchise agreements comply with these statutory requirements, failure to comply with these laws could result in our company incurring civil liability. In addition, while historically our franchising operations have not been materially adversely affected by such regulation, we cannot predict the effect of any future federal or state legislation or regulation.

        "Real Estate and Mortgage Regulation. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”) and state real estate brokerage laws and mortgage regulations restrict payments which real estate brokers, mortgage brokers, and other service providers in the real estate industry may receive or pay in connection with the sales of residences and referral of settlement services, such as real estate brokerage, mortgages, homeowners’ insurance and title insurance. Such laws affect the terms that we may offer in our franchise agreements with Motto franchisees and may to some extent restrict preferred vendor programs, both for Motto and RE/MAX. Federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances related to the origination of mortgages, may affect other aspects of the Motto business, including the extent to which we can obtain data on Motto franchisees’ compliance with their franchise agreements. These laws and regulations include (i) the Federal Truth in Lending Act of 1969 (“TILA”), and Regulation Z (“Reg Z”) thereunder; (ii) the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\"ECOA'') and Regulation B thereunder; (iii) the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V thereunder; (iv) RESPA, and Regulation X thereunder; (v) the Fair Housing Act; (vi) the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act; (vii) the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing regulations; (viii) the Consumer Financial Protection Act and its implementing regulations; (ix) the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act-FACT ACT and its implementing regulations; and (x) the Do Not Call/Do Not Fax Act and other state and federal laws pertaining to the solicitation of consumers.",

Gaming authorities have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable and the burden of demonstrating suitability and the cost of the investigation is the responsibility of the applicant. While the criteria vary between jurisdictions, generally, in determining whether to grant or renew a license, the gaming authorities will consider the good character, honesty and integrity of the applicant and the financial ability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant. For individual applicants, gaming authorities consider the individual’s business experience and reputation for good character, the individual’s criminal history and the character of those with whom the individual associates. Qualification and suitability determinations for individuals requires the individual to submit detailed personal and financial information to the gaming authority, followed by a thorough background investigation. Gaming authorities may deny an application for licensing or a determination of suitability for any cause which they deem reasonable. If one or more gaming authorities were to find that an officer, director or key employee fails to qualify or is unsuitable to participate in the gaming industry in such jurisdiction, we would be required to sever all relationships with such person.

Most jurisdictions allow an “institutional investor” to apply for a waiver from such requirements provided that the institutional investor holds the ownership interest in the ordinary course of its business and for passive investment purposes only. Generally, an “institutional investor” includes an investor who is a bank, insurance company, investment company, investment advisor, or pension fund. In some jurisdictions, an application for a waiver as an institutional investor requires the submission of detailed information concerning the institutional investor and its business including, among other things, the name of each person that beneficially owns more than 5% of the voting securities of such institutional investor. If such a waiver is granted, then the institutional investor may acquire, in most cases, up to 10% of our voting securities without applying for a finding of suitability or qualification and, in some cases, a higher percentage of beneficial ownership. Even if a waiver is granted, an institutional investor may not take any action inconsistent with its status when the waiver is granted without becoming subject to a suitability determination or background investigation.

Class III gaming includes all other forms of gaming that are neither Class I nor Class II and includes a broad range of traditional casino games such as slot machines, blackjack, craps and roulette, as well as wagering games and electronic facsimiles of any game of chance. IGRA generally permits a Native American tribe to conduct Class III gaming activities on reservation lands subject to the detailed requirements of IGRA and provided that the Native American tribe has entered into a written agreement or compact with the state that specifically authorizes the types of Class III gaming the tribe may offer. The tribal-state compacts vary from state to state. Many such tribal-state compacts address the manner and extent to which the state or tribe will license manufacturers and suppliers of gaming devices and conduct background investigations and certify the suitability of persons such as officers, directors, key persons and, in some cases, shareholders of gaming device manufacturers and suppliers.",

The NIGC has authority to issue regulations related to tribal gaming activities, approve tribal ordinances for regulating gaming, approve management agreements for gaming facilities, conduct investigations and monitor tribal gaming generally. IGRA is subject to interpretation by the NIGC and may be subject to judicial and legislative clarification or amendment. The gaming ordinance of each Native American tribe conducting gaming under IGRA and the terms of any applicable tribal-state compact establish the regulatory requirements under which we must conduct business on Native American tribal lands.",

A “management contract” includes any agreement between a Native American tribe and a contractor if such contract or agreement provides for the management of all or part of a gaming operation. To the extent that any of our agreements with Native American tribes are deemed to be management contracts, such agreements would require the approval of the NIGC in order to be valid. To our knowledge, none of our current agreements with Native American tribes qualify as management contracts under IGRA.",

Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by properties used for business purposes such as office buildings, industrial facilities and retail facilities. At December 31, 2020, $266.2 million of our commercial real estate portfolio was owner occupied commercial real estate, and the remaining $2.233 billion was secured by income producing, or non-owner occupied commercial real estate. We intend to continue to grow our commercial real estate loan portfolio while maintaining prudent underwriting standards. In addition to originating these loans, we also participate in loans with other financial institutions. ",
        "We originate a variety of fixed- and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans for terms and amortization periods up to 30 years, which may include balloon loans. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans adjust every three, five, seven or ten years and generally are adjusted to a rate equal to a percentage above the corresponding U.S. Treasury rate or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing rate. Most of our adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans adjust every five years and amortize over terms of 25 to 30 years. We also include prepayment penalties on loans we originate. Loan amounts generally do not exceed 75% of the property’s appraised value at the time the loan is originated. In addition, properties are generally required by policy to have a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.20x. We require independent appraisals on all loans secured by commercial real estate from an approved appraisers list. We require most of our commercial real estate loan borrowers to submit annual financial statements and/or rent rolls on the subject property. These properties may also be subject to annual inspections to support that appropriate maintenance is being performed by the owner/borrower. Our policy is to review all commercial real estate loans over $1 million at least annually along with each of these loan’s commercial real estate borrower and, as applicable, each guarantor. The loan and its borrowers and/or guarantors are subject to an annual risk review verifying that the loan is properly risk rated based upon covenant compliance and other terms as provided for in the loan agreements. While this process does not prevent loans from becoming delinquent, it provides us with the opportunity to better identify problem loans in a timely manner and to work with the borrower prior to the loan becoming delinquent.

        "The average outstanding loan size in our commercial real estate portfolio was $4.0 million as of December 31, 2020. We currently target new individual commercial real estate loan originations to owners and investors in our market area and generally originate loans to one borrower up to $100.0 million. We generally do not make commercial real estate loans outside our primary market areas. Our largest single commercial real estate relationship at December 31, 2020 totaled $110.2 million. These loans are secured by office buildings. Our next largest borrowing relationship at December 31, 2020 was for $89.7 million and is secured by hotels, office buildings and retail space. The third largest relationship was for $78.8 million at December 31, 2020 and is secured by industrial/warehouse properties. At December 31, 2020, all of these loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms. ",
        "One- to Four-Family Residential Loans. Our one- to four-family residential loan portfolio consists of mortgage loans that enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the owner. At December 31, 2020, one- to four-family residential loans were $564.1 million, or 10.2% of our total loan portfolio.  The one- to four-family residential portfolio consists of $52.0 million and $512.1 million of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, respectively, at December 31, 2020. We generally offer fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans with terms up to 30 years. Generally, our fixed-rate loans conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines and those with longer terms (more than 10 years) are originated with the intention to sell. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally adjust annually or ",
        "6",
        "every three years after an initial fixed period that ranges from three to ten years. Management has the ability to hold the remaining fixed-rate loans in our loan portfolio for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate equal to a percentage above the one or three year U.S. Treasury index. Depending on the loan type, the maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2% per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate caps range from 2% to 6% over the initial interest rate of the loan. Our residential loans generally do not have prepayment penalties. ",
        "Borrower demand for adjustable-rate compared to fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans as compared to the interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment. The loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions. ",
        "While our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans. We do not offer loans with negative amortization and generally do not offer interest-only, one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Additionally, our current practice is generally (1) to sell to the secondary market newly originated longer-term (terms of 10 years or greater) fixed-rate, one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and (2) to hold in our portfolio shorter-term, fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans. We sell residential real estate loans in the secondary market primarily with servicing released. We also sell loans to Fannie Mae, the Federal Home Loan Bank Mortgage Partnership Finance Program and other investors with servicing retained. ",
        "We will make loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 95% (100% for first time home buyers) with such value measured at origination; however, we generally require private mortgage insurance for loans with a loan-to-value ratio over 80%. We require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a licensed real estate appraiser. We generally require title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance is required for loans on properties located in a flood zone. ",
        "In an effort to provide financing for first-time buyers, we offer fixed-rate 30-year residential real estate loans through the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency First Time Home Buyer Program. We offer mortgage loans through this program to qualified individuals and originate the loans using modified underwriting guidelines and loan conditions. ",
        "We also offer adjustable-rate loans secured by one- to four-family properties that are not owner-occupied. Non-owner-occupied one- to four-family residential loans generally can be made with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 75% with such value measured at origination. At December 31, 2020, these loans totaled $339.5 million. Non-owner-occupied residential loans can have higher risk of loss than owner-occupied residential loans, as payment on such loans often depends on successful operation and management of the properties. In addition, non-owner-occupied residential borrowers may be more willing to default on a loan than an owner-occupied residential borrower as the non-owner-occupied residential borrower would not be losing his or her residence. ",
        "Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2020, multi-family real estate loans were $880.6 million, or 16.0% of our total loan portfolio. The multi-family loan portfolio consisted of $104.7 million of fixed-rate loans and $775.9 million of adjustable-rate loans at December 31, 2020. Our multi-family real estate loans are generally secured by apartment buildings. We intend to continue to grow our multi-family loan portfolio, while maintaining prudent underwriting standards. In addition to originating these loans, we also participate in loans with other financial institutions. ",
        "We originate a variety of adjustable-rate, multi-family real estate loans for terms up to 30 years.

        "Construction Loans.  Historically, we have originated construction loans for commercial real estate, multi-family properties and one- to four-family residential developments.  Although well diversified with respect to price ranges and borrowers, our construction loans are significantly concentrated in the greater Boston metropolitan area.  At December 31, 2020, construction loans were $731.4 million, or 13.2% of our total loan portfolio. ",
        "We primarily make construction loans for commercial development projects, including apartment buildings, condominiums, small industrial buildings and retail and office buildings. Most of our construction loans provide for the payment of only interest during the construction phase, which is usually up to 12 to 36 months, although some construction loans are renewed, generally for one or two additional years. At the end of the construction phase, the loan may convert to a permanent mortgage loan or the loan may be paid in full. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75% of the appraised market value upon completion of the project. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We also will generally require an inspection of the property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. ",
        "We also originate construction and site development loans to contractors and builders to finance the construction of single-family homes and subdivisions. While we may originate these loans whether or not the collateral property underlying the loan is under contract for sale, we consider each project carefully in light of current residential real estate market conditions. We actively monitor the number of unsold homes in our construction loan portfolio and local housing markets to attempt to maintain an appropriate balance between home sales and new loan originations. The maximum number of speculative loans (loans that are not pre-sold) approved for each builder is based on a combination of factors, including the financial capacity of the builder, the market demand for the finished product and the ratio of sold to unsold inventory the builder maintains. We have attempted to diversify the risk associated with speculative construction lending by doing business with a large number of experienced small and mid-sized builders within our market area. ",
        "We regularly monitor the construction loan portfolio and the economic conditions and housing inventory in each of our markets and increase or decrease this type of lending as we observe market conditions change.  We believe that the underwriting policies and internal monitoring systems we have in place have helped to mitigate some of the risks inherent in construction and land lending.",

Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare. In the U.S, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including the ACA. While it is difficult to assess the impact of the ACA in isolation, either in general or on our business specifically, it is widely thought that the ACA increases downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of, and the price we may charge for, LUPKYNIS. Further, the U.S. and foreign governments regularly consider reform measures that affect healthcare coverage and costs. Such reforms may include changes to the coverage and reimbursement of healthcare services and products. In particular, there have been recent judicial ",

Additionally, the United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing the constitutionality of the ACA, but it is unclear when a decision will be made. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.  It is unclear how these decisions, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business.

For example, the new Biden administration has indicated that lowering prescription drug prices is a priority, but we do not yet know what steps the administration will take or whether such steps will be successful.

To maintain compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, for example, we are required to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which has been both costly and challenging. We will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, continue to engage outside consultants and follow a detailed work plan to continue to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. There is a risk that in the future neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404.

The Company faces additional competition for deposits from online financial institutions and non-depository competitors, such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms, and insurance companies. We compete for deposits by offering depositors a high level of personal service and expertise together with a wide range of financial services. Our deposit sources are primarily concentrated in the communities surrounding our banking offices. As of June 30, 2020, our FDIC-insured deposit market share in the counties we serve, out of 59 bank and thrift institutions, was 0.65%. Such data does not reflect deposits held by credit unions.",

Included in residential real estate loans are traditional one- to four-family mortgage loans, home equity installment loans, and home equity lines of credit. We generate loans through our marketing efforts, existing customers and referrals, real estate brokers, builders and local businesses. At December 31, 2020, $344.1 million, or 32.9%, of our total loan portfolio was invested in residential loans.",
        "One- to Four-Family Mortgage Loans",
        ".",
        " One of our primary lending activities is the origination of fixed-rate, one- to four-family, owner-occupied, residential mortgage loans with terms up to 30 years secured by property located in our market area. At December 31, 2020, one- to four-family mortgage loans totaled $251.4 million. Our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans are generally conforming loans, underwritten according to secondary market guidelines. We generally originate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which, for 2020, is typically $510,400 for single-family homes, except in certain high-cost areas in the United States. At December 31, 2020, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with principal balances in excess of $510,400, commonly referred to as jumbo loans, totaled $38.5 million. Our mortgage loans amortize monthly with principal and interest due each month. These loans often remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods than their contractual terms because borrowers may refinance or prepay loans at their option without a prepayment penalty.",
        "When underwriting one- to four-family mortgage loans, we review and verify each loan applicant’s income and credit history. Management believes that stability of income and past credit history are integral parts in the underwriting process. Written appraisals are generally required on real estate property offered to secure an applicant’s loan. We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans to 80% of the purchase price or appraised value of the property, whichever is less. For one- to four-family real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios of over 80%, we generally require private mortgage insurance. We require fire and casualty insurance on all properties securing real estate loans. We require title insurance, or an attorney’s title opinion, as circumstances warrant.",
        "Our one- to four-family mortgage loans customarily include due-on-sale clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the underlying real property serving as collateral for the loan.",
        "Fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with terms of 15 years or more are originated for resale to the secondary market. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we originated $32.1 million and $10.7 million of fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, respectively, which were subsequently sold in the secondary mortgage market.",
        "The origination of fixed-rate mortgage loans versus adjustable-rate mortgage loans is monitored on an ongoing basis and is affected significantly by the level of market interest rates, customer preference, our interest rate risk position and our competitors’ loan products. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate totaled $40.3 million at December 31, 2020. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans make our loan portfolio more interest rate sensitive. However, as the interest income earned on adjustable-rate mortgage loans varies with prevailing interest rates, such loans do not offer predictable cash flows in the same manner as long-term, fixed-rate loans. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans carry increased credit risk associated with potentially higher monthly payments by borrowers as general market interest rates increase. It is possible that during periods of rising interest rates that the risk of delinquencies and defaults on adjustable-rate mortgage loans may increase due to the upward adjustment of interest costs to the borrower, resulting in increased loan losses.",
        "7",
        "We do not offer an “interest only” mortgage loan product on one- to four-family residential properties (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer a “subprime loan” program (loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (traditionally defined as loans having less than full documentation). We may originate loans to consumers with a credit score below 660. This may be defined as subprime loans, however there are typically mitigating circumstances that according to FDIC guidance and our opinion would not designate such loans as “subprime.”",
        "Home Equity Loans.",
        " At December 31, 2020, home equity loans totaled $92.7 million. Our home equity loans and lines of credit are generally secured by the borrower’s principal residence. The maximum amount of a home equity loan or line of credit is generally 85% of the appraised value of a borrower’s real estate collateral less the amount of any prior mortgages or related liabilities. Home equity loans and lines of credit are approved with both fixed and adjustable interest rates, which we determine based upon market conditions. Such loans are fully amortized over the life of the loan. Generally, the maximum term for home equity loans is 20 years.",
        "Our underwriting standards for home equity loans include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally from any verifiable secondary income. We also consider the length of employment with the borrower’s present employer. Creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration; however, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount.",
        "We primarily originate home equity loans secured by first lien mortgages. Home equity loans in a junior lien position totaled $12.1 million at December 31, 2020 and entail greater risks than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans or home equity loans secured by first lien mortgages. In such cases, collateral repossessed after a default may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of damage or depreciation in the value of the property or loss of equity to the first lien position. Further, home equity loan payments are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Finally, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans in the event of a default.",
        "Commercial Real Estate Loans.",
        " We originate commercial real estate loans that are secured primarily by improved properties, such as retail facilities, office buildings and other non-residential buildings as well as multifamily properties. At December 31, 2020, $373.6 million, or 35.9% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial real estate loans.",
        "Our commercial real estate loans generally have adjustable interest rates with terms of up to 15 years and amortization periods up to 25 years. The adjustable rate loans are typically fixed for the first five years and adjust every five years thereafter. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial real estate loans is generally 75% to 80% of the lower of cost or appraised value of the property securing the loan.",
        "We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including project-level and global cash flows and debt service coverage, credit history and management expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property, securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with the Bank and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors considered include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the property. We generally will not lend to high volatility commercial real estate projects. All commercial real estate loans are appraised by outside independent state certified general appraisers. Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial real estate loan borrowers, although this requirement may be waived in limited circumstances depending upon the loan-to-value ratio and the debt-service ratio associated with the loan. The Bank requires property and casualty insurance and flood insurance if the property is in a flood zone area.",
        "We underwrite commercial real estate loan participations to the same standards as loans originated by us. In addition, we consider the financial strength and reputation of the lead lender. We require the lead lender to provide a full closing package as well as annual financial statements for the borrower and related entities so that we can conduct an annual loan review for all loan participations. Loans secured by commercial real estate generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the successful operation or management of the properties securing the loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the ",

        "successful operation of the related business and real estate property. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.",
        "Construction Loans.",
        " We originate construction loans to individuals to finance the construction of residential dwellings and also originate loans for the construction of commercial properties, including hotels, apartment buildings, housing developments, and owner-occupied properties used for businesses. At December 31, 2020, $72.6 million, or 6.9% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of construction loans. Our construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually 12 to 18 months. At the end of the construction phase, the loan generally converts to a permanent residential or commercial mortgage loan. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% on both residential and commercial construction. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require a pro forma appraisal of the property, as completed by an independent licensed appraiser. We also will require an inspection of the property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. We typically do not lend to developers unless they maintain a 15% cash equity position in the project.",
        "Commercial and Industrial Loans.",
        " We originate commercial and industrial loans and lines of credit to borrowers located in our market area that are generally secured by collateral other than real estate, such as equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, and other business assets. At December 31, 2020, $126.8 million, or 12.1% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial and industrial loans, of which $55.1 million are Payroll Protection Program (\"PPP\") loans. ",
        "Exclusive of PPP loans, commercial and industrial loans generally have terms of maturity from five to seven years with adjustable interest rates tied to the prime rate, LIBOR or the weekly average of the FHLB of Pittsburgh three- to ten-year fixed rates. We generally obtain personal guarantees from the borrower or a third party as a condition to originating the loan. On a limited basis, we will originate unsecured business loans in those instances where the applicant’s financial strength and creditworthiness has been established. Commercial business loans generally bear higher interest rates than residential loans, but they also may involve a higher risk of default because their repayment is generally dependent on the successful operation of the borrower’s business.",
        "Our underwriting standards for commercial business loans include a determination of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan from normal cash flows generated in the applicant’s business. We assess the financial strength of each applicant through the review of financial statements and tax returns provided by the applicant. The creditworthiness of an applicant is derived from a review of credit reports as well as a search of public records. We periodically review business loans following origination. We request financial statements at least annually and review them for substantial deviations or changes that might affect repayment of the loan. Our loan officers may also visit the premises of borrowers to observe the business premises, facilities, and personnel and to inspect the pledged collateral. Lines of credit secured with accounts receivable and inventory typically require that the customer provide a monthly borrowing base certificate that is reviewed prior to each draw request. Underwriting standards for business loans are different for each type of loan depending on the financial strength of the applicant and the value of collateral offered as security. All commercial loans are assigned a risk rating, which is reviewed internally, as well as by independent loan review professionals, annually.",
        "The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and provided over $2.0 trillion in emergency economic relief to individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which included authorizing the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) to temporarily guarantee loans under a new 7(a) loan program called the PPP. On April 16, 2020, the original $349 billion funding cap was reached. On April 23, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (the “PPP Enhancement Act”) was signed into law and included an additional $484 billion in COVID-19 relief, including allocating an additional $310 billion to replenish the PPP. ",
        "PPP was designed to help small businesses keep their workforce employed and cover expenses during the COVID-19 crisis. Under the PPP, participating SBA and other qualifying lenders originated loans to eligible businesses that are fully guaranteed by the SBA as to principal and accrued interest, have more favorable terms than traditional SBA loans and may be forgiven if the proceeds are used by the borrower for certain eligible purposes. PPP loans have an interest rate of 1% per annum. Loans issued prior to June 5, 2020 have a term to maturity of two-years and loans issued after June 5, 2020 have a term to maturity of five-years. Loan payments were deferred for six months. The Bank received a processing fee from the SBA ranging from 1% to 5% depending on the size of the loan, which was offset by a 0.75% third-party servicing agent fee. ",
        "In 2020, the Bank originated 639 loans totaling $71.0 million. Among the largest sectors impacted were $15.6 million in loans for health care and social assistance, $12.6 million for construction and specialty-trade contractors, $6.1 million for professional and technical services, $6.1 million for retail trade, $5.1 million for wholesale trade, $4.6 million for manufacturing and $3.4 million for restaurant and food services. Net deferred origination fees were $2.2 million, of which $1.1 million was recognized during year ended December 31, 2020. Processing of PPP loan forgiveness began in the fourth quarter of 2020 and at December 31, 2020, PPP loans totaled $55.1 million. No allowance for loan loss was allocated to the PPP loan portfolio due to the Bank complying with the lender obligations that ensure SBA guarantee. ",

        "Consumer Loans.",
        " We originate consumer loans that primarily consist of indirect auto loans and, to a lesser extent, secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit. As of December 31, 2020, consumer loans totaled $113.9 million, or 10.9%, of our total loan portfolio, of which $106.4 million were indirect auto loans. Consumer loans are generally offered on a fixed-rate basis. Our underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally from any verifiable secondary income. We also consider the length of employment with the borrower’s present employer as well as the amount of time the borrower has lived in the local area. Creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration; however, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount.",
        "Indirect auto loans are loans that are sold by auto dealerships to third parties, such as banks or other types of lenders. We work with various auto dealers throughout our lending area. The dealer collects information from the applicant and transmits it to us electronically for review, where we can either accept or reject the applicant without ever meeting the applicant. If the Bank approves the applicant’s request for financing, the Bank purchases the dealership-originated installment sales contract and is known as the holder in due course that is entitled to receive principal and interest payments from a borrower. As compensation for generating the loan, a portion of the rate is advanced to the dealer and accrued in a prepaid dealer reserve account. As a result, the Bank’s yield is below the contractual interest rate because the Bank must wait for the stream of loan payments to be repaid. The Bank will receive a pro rata refund of the amount prepaid to the dealer only if the loan prepays within the first six months or if the collateral for the loan is repossessed. The Bank is responsible for pursuing repossession if the borrower defaults on payments.",
        "Consumer loans entail greater risks than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, particularly consumer loans secured by rapidly depreciating assets, such as automobiles, or loans that are unsecured. In such cases, collateral repossessed after a default may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of damage, loss or depreciation. Further, consumer loan payments are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Such events would increase our risk of loss on unsecured loans. Finally, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans in the event of a default.",
        "Loan Portfolio Maturities and Yields.",
        " The following table summarizes the scheduled repayments of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. Demand loans, loans having no stated repayment schedule or maturity, and overdraft loans are reported as being due in one year or less. Consumer loans consist primarily of indirect automobile loans whereby a portion of the rate is prepaid to the dealer and accrued in a prepaid dealer reserve account. Therefore, the true yield for the portfolio is significantly less than the note rate disclosed below.",

In the approval process for residential loans, we assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the value of the property securing the loan. To assess the borrower’s ability to repay, we review the borrower’s income and expenses and employment and credit history. In the case of commercial loans, we also review projected income, expenses and the viability of the project being financed. We generally require appraisals of all real property securing loans. Appraisals are performed by independent licensed appraisers. The Bank’s loan approval policies and limits are also established by its Board. All loans originated by the Bank are subject to its underwriting guidelines. Loan approval authorities vary based on loan size in the aggregate. Individual officer loan approval authority generally applies to loans of up $1.0 million. Loans above that amount and up to 65% of the Bank’s legal lending limit may be approved by the Loan Committee.

Collection efforts continue until it is determined that the debt is uncollectable.",

In Pennsylvania, an Act 91 Notice is mailed to the borrower stating that they have 33 days to cure the default before foreclosure is initiated. In West Virginia, a Notice of Default is mailed and in Ohio, a demand letter is mailed when a loan is 60 days delinquent. When a loan becomes 90 or more days delinquent, it is forwarded to the Bank’s attorney to pursue other remedies. An official mortgage foreclosure complaint typically occurs at 120 days delinquent. In the event collection efforts have not succeeded, the property will proceed to a Sheriff Sale to be sold.",

Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed from interest income. Loans that are 90 days or more past due may still accrue interest if they are well secured and in the process of collection. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied against principal.

        "The Company uses an eight-point internal risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The first four categories are not considered criticized and are aggregated as “pass” rated. The criticized rating categories used by management generally follow bank regulatory definitions. The special mention category includes assets that are currently protected but are below average quality, resulting in an undue credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a substandard classification. Loans in the substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and have a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified as substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current conditions and facts, is highly improbable.

        "Allowance for Loan Losses.",
        " The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance based on losses in the current loan portfolio, which includes an assessment of economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, loan loss experience, volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as other loan modifications, quality of the Company’s loan review system, the degree of oversight by the Company’s Board, existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations, effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements and other relevant factors. While management uses the best information available to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making evaluations. Additions are made to the allowance through periodic provisions charged to income and recovery of principal and interest on loans previously charged-off. Losses of principal are charged directly to the allowance when a loss occurs or when a determination is made that the specific loss is probable. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available.",
        "The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due for principal and interest according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a loan’s effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, the observable market price, or, if the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the underlying collateral. When the measurement of an impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the impairment is recorded in a specific valuation allowance through a charge to the provision for loan losses. Any reserve for unfunded lending ",

Accordingly, we do not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment measurements, unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower.",
        "The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical charge-off experience and expected loss given our internal risk rating process. The loan portfolio is stratified into homogeneous groups of loans that possess similar loss characteristics and an appropriate loss ratio adjusted for other qualitative factors is applied to the homogeneous pools of loans to estimate the incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The other qualitative factors considered by management include, but are not limited to, the following:",

        "Commercial real estate loans generally have higher credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, payment experience on loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the related real estate project, and this may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the real estate market and in the general economy.",
        "Commercial and industrial business loans involve a greater risk of default than one- to four-residential mortgage loans of like duration because their repayment generally depends on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and the sufficiency of collateral, if any.",
        "This specific valuation allowance is periodically adjusted for significant changes in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows, observable market price or fair value of the collateral. The specific valuation allowance, or allowance for impaired loans, is part of the total allowance for loan losses. Cash payments received on impaired loans that are considered non-accrual are recorded as a direct reduction of the recorded investment in the loan. When the recorded investment has been fully collected, receipts are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until the previously charged-off principal is fully recovered. Subsequent amounts collected are recognized as interest income. If no charge-off exists, then once the recorded investment has been fully collected, any future amounts collected would be recognized as interest income. Impaired loans are not returned to accrual status until all amounts due, both principal and interest, are current and a sustained payment history has been demonstrated. Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR) loans are generally considered impaired loans until such loans are performing in accordance with their modified terms. Once a TDR loan establishes a consistent payment history under the modified terms, then it is considered to return to accrual status. A consistent payment history is generally demonstrated by payment under the modified terms for a period of least six consecutive months. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class, including commercial loans not considered impaired, as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential real estate and consumer loans. An unallocated component, which is a part of the general allowance component, is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect the Company’s estimate of probable losses. Generally, management considers all nonaccrual and TDR loans and certain renegotiated debt, when it exists, for impairment. The maximum period without payment that typically can occur before a loan is considered for impairment is 90 days. The past due status of loans receivable is determined based on contractual due dates for loan payments.",

The investment policy also permits investments in certificates of deposit, securities purchased under an agreement to resell, banker’s acceptances, commercial paper and federal funds. Our current investment policy generally does not permit investment in stripped mortgage-backed securities, short sales, derivatives, or other high-risk securities. Federal and Pennsylvania state laws generally limit our investment activities to those permissible for a national bank.",
        "The accounting rules require that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held to maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent. Securities available for sale are reported at fair value, while securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. Our entire portfolio is designated as available-for-sale.",

Liquidity levels may be increased or decreased depending upon the yields on investment alternatives and upon management’s judgment as to the attractiveness of the yields then available in relation to other opportunities and its expectation of the level of yield that will be available in the future, as well as management’s projections as to the short-term demand for funds to be used in our loan originations and other activities.",

At December 31, 2020, these securities had an average expected life of 0.6 years.

Municipal bonds may be general obligation of the issuer or secured by specific revenues. The majority of our municipal bonds are general obligation bonds, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the municipality, paid off with funds from taxes and other fees, and have ratings (when available) of A or above.

        "MBS’s are created by pooling mortgages and issuing a security with an interest rate that is less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages. CMO’s generally are a specific class of MBS’s that are divided based on risk assessments and maturity dates. These mortgage classes are pooled into a special purpose entity, where tranches are created and sold to investors. Investors in a CMO are purchasing bonds issued by the entity, and then receive payments based on the income derived from the pooled mortgages. The various pools are divided into tranches are then securitized and sold to the investor. MBS’s typically represent a participation interest in a pool of one- to four-family or multifamily mortgages, although we invest primarily in MBS’s backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors. Some security pools are guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest to investors. MBS’s generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements. However, MBS’s are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, MBS’s may be used to collateralize our specific liabilities and obligations. Finally, MBS’s are assigned lower risk-weightings for purposes of calculating our risk-based capital level.",
        "Investments in MBS’s involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may result in adjustments to the amortization of any premium or acceleration of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities.",

There are periodic examinations of the Bank by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC to review the Bank’s compliance with various regulatory requirements. The Bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a commercial bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.

However, the Dodd-Frank Act’s changes go well beyond that and affect the lending, investments and other operations of all depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital for holding companies are restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. The legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect upon passage, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.",

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, such as the Bank, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks with $10 billion or less in assets are still examined for compliance by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also gave state attorney generals the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.",

        "The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The legislation also increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008. The Dodd-Frank Act increased shareholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so called “golden parachute” payments. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. Further, the legislation requires that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans, directs the Federal Reserve to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage origination.",

        "Bank Regulation",
        "Business Activities.",
        " The Bank derives its lending and investment powers from the applicable Pennsylvania law, federal law and applicable state and federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, The Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits.",
        "Capital Requirements.",
        " Federal regulations require state banks to meet three minimum capital standards: a 1.5% tangible capital ratio, a 4% core capital to assets leverage ratio (3% for savings associations receiving the highest rating on the composite, or “CAMELS,” rating system for capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk), and an 8% risk-based capital ratio.",
        "The risk-based capital standard for state banks requires the maintenance of Tier 1 (core) and total capital (which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 4% and 8%, respectively. In determining the amount of risk weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor of 0% to 1250%, assigned by the regulations, based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Core capital is defined as common shareholders’ equity (including retained earnings), certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships. The components of supplementary capital include cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock, the allowance for loan losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities with readily determinable fair market values. Overall, the amount of supplementary capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital. Additionally, an institution that retains credit risk in connection with an asset sale is required to maintain additional regulatory capital because of the purchaser’s recourse against the institution. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual associations where necessary.",
        "At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.",
        "The risk-based capital rule and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets by the FDIC and the other federal bank regulators are consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The rule applies to all depository institutions (such as the Bank) and top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $3.0 billion or more. Among other things, the rule established a common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4.0% to 6.0% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain available-for-sale securities to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-in or opt-out is exercised. The Bank elected the one-time opt-out election for accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to be excluded from the regulatory capital calculation. The rule limits a banking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in at 0.625% per year beginning January 1, 2016 and ended January 1, 2019, when the full 2.5% capital conservation buffer requirement became effective.",
        "Loans-to-One Borrower.",
        " Generally, a Pennsylvania-chartered commercial bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of capital. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.",
        "24",
        "Capital Distributions.",
        " The Pennsylvania Banking Code states, in part, that dividends may be declared and paid only out of accumulated net earnings and may not be declared or paid unless surplus is at least equal to capital. Dividends may not reduce surplus without the prior consent of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement.",
        "Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.",
        " All insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. The FDIC is required to assess the Bank’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. Failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications, such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.",
        "The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. The Bank received a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent federal examination.",
        "Transactions with Related Parties.",
        " A state-chartered bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls or is under common control with an insured depository institution, such as the Bank. The Company is an affiliate of the Bank because of its control of the Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a state-chartered bank from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.",
        "The Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank’s capital. In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank’s Board. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.",
        "Standards for Safety and Soundness.",
        " Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.",
        "Prompt Corrective Action Regulations.",
        " Under the Federal Prompt Corrective Action statute, the FDIC is required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized state-chartered banks under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital. An institution that has total risk-based capital of less than 8% or a leverage ratio or a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that generally is less than 4% is considered to be “undercapitalized”. An institution that has total risk-based capital less than 6%, a Tier 1 core risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or a leverage ratio that is less than 3% is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized.” An institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.”",
        "Generally, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the “Pennsylvania Department of Banking” or “PDBS”) is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a state-chartered bank that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date that an institution is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any bank holding company of an institution that is required to submit a capital restoration plan ",
        "25",
        "must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5% of the institution’s assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC or the amount necessary to restore the institution to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures, such as restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The PDBS may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.",
        "At December 31, 2020, the Bank met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized.”",
        "In addition, the final capital rule adopted in July 2013 revises the prompt corrective action categories to incorporate the revised minimum capital requirements of that rule.",
        "Enforcement.",
        " The Pennsylvania Department of Banking maintains enforcement authority over the Bank, including the power to issue cease and desist orders and civil money penalties and to remove directors, officers or employees. It also has the power to appoint a conservator or receiver for a bank upon insolvency, imminent insolvency, unsafe or unsound condition or certain other situations. The FDIC has primary federal enforcement responsibility over non-Federal Reservice Bank (“FRB”)-member state banks and has authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution-affiliated parties, including shareholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful actions likely to have an adverse effect on the bank. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or even $1 million per day in especially egregious cases. In general, regulatory enforcement actions occur with respect to situations involving unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, violations of law or regulation or breaches of fiduciary duty. Federal and Pennsylvania laws also establish criminal penalties for certain violations.",
        "Insurance of Deposit Accounts.",
        " The Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions, such as the Bank. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the DIF.",
        "The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target DIF ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC was required to seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020, and insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more were supposed to fund the increase. On September 30, 2018, the 1.35% ratio was exceeded, reaching 1.36%. Insured institutions of less than $10 billion of assets will receive credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to raising the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35% effective when the fund rate achieves 1.38%. The fund rate achieved 1.40% as of June 30, 2019, and the FDIC first applied small bank credits on the September 30, 2019 assessment invoice (for the second quarter of 2019). The FDIC will continue to apply small bank credits so long as the ratio is at least 1.35%. After applying small bank credits for four quarters, the FDIC will remit to banks the value of any remaining small bank credits in the next assessment period in which the ratio is at least 1.35%. A total of $308,000 of DIF credits were recognized in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. All DIF credits available to the Bank have been utilized. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC to establish a maximum fund ratio. The FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-range fund ratio of 2%. The FDIC announced that the ratio had declined to 1.30% at September 30, 2020  due largely to consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDIC adopted a plan to restore the fund to the 1.35% ratio within eight years but did not change its assessment schedule.",
        "In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980's to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO matured in 2019.",
        "The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.",
        "Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. The Bank complies with the foregoing requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually and, for 2021, establish a 3% reserve ratio for aggregate transaction accounts up to $182.9 million, a 10% ratio above $182.9 million, and an exemption of $21.1 million.

The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary depository institution becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve supervisory staff before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred.

        "The regulatory framework relating to privacy and data protection issues worldwide is evolving rapidly and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws, regulations and applicable industry standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws, regulations and standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our existing privacy and data management practices. As we expand into new jurisdictions or verticals, we will need to understand and comply with various new requirements applicable in those jurisdictions or verticals. For example, we have entered into agreements and are actively pursuing opportunities to provide our aiWARE SaaS solutions to customers in Europe, which involve processing of personal data.  In providing our aiWARE SaaS solutions and related services, we are deemed to be a data processor and are required to comply with the GDPR, which applies to all companies processing personal data of EU residents regardless of the company’s location, as well as with additional obligations to our customers to support their compliance with the GDPR.  We are also obligated to comply with the GDPR (and similar regulations in other jurisdictions including the United Kingdom) as a data controller with respect to personal data of certain employees and individuals employed or engaged by our current or prospective customers, vendors and service providers, which we receive and process in the course of our business.  The GDPR imposes financial penalties for non-compliance, which can be up to four percent of global revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater.  We are also required to comply with the CCPA and the regulations implemented thereunder, with respect to personal information of California consumers that we collect and process, both directly and indirectly as a service provider to our customers.  ",

        "To the extent applicable to our business or the businesses of our customers, these laws, regulations and industry standards could have negative effects on our business, including by increasing our costs and operating expenses, and delaying or impeding our deployment of new core functionality and products. Compliance with these laws, regulations and industry standards requires significant management time and attention, and failure to comply could result in negative publicity, subject us to contractual liability, fines or penalties or result in demands that we modify or cease existing business practices. In addition, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and industry standards may adversely affect our customers’ ability or desire to collect, use, process and store personal information using our software solutions, which could reduce overall demand for them. Even the perception of privacy and data security concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market acceptance of our software solutions in certain markets. Furthermore, privacy and data security concerns may cause our customers’ customers, vendors, employees and other industry participants to resist providing the personal information necessary to allow our customers to use our products and services effectively. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our business and operating results. ",

In the event these jurisdictions challenge our approach or our customers do not satisfy the sales or use tax obligation, such jurisdictions may assert tax assessments, penalties and/or interest, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. These fluctuations have been, and may continue to be, even more pronounced in the trading market for our common stock. ",
        "Further, on some occasions, our stock price may be, or may be purported to be, subject to “short squeeze” activity. A “short squeeze” is a technical market condition that occurs when the price of a stock increases substantially, forcing market participants who had taken a position that its price would fall (i.e., who had sold the stock “short”), to buy it, which in turn may create significant, short-term demand for the stock not for fundamental reasons, but rather due to the need for such market participants to acquire the stock in order to forestall the risk of even greater losses. A “short squeeze” condition in the market for a stock can lead to short-term conditions involving very high volatility and trading that may or may not track fundamental valuation models.",
        "In addition, in the past, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Securities litigation brought against us following volatility in our stock price, regardless of the merit or ultimate results of such litigation, could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and operating results and divert management’s attention and resources from our business. ",
        "If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. ",
        "As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules implemented by the SEC.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  This report must contain, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a ",

",
        "We identified control deficiencies in our financial reporting processes, which constituted a material weakness for the year ended December 31, 2019. The material weakness related primarily to the accounting for advertising net revenues.  The identified control deficiencies resulted in a number of financial statement adjustments. The net impact of these adjustments on our financial statements was not material. During 2020, we implemented measures to remediate this material weakness, and we concluded that it had been fully remediated as of December 31, 2020.  However, our remedial actions may not prevent this or similar weaknesses from re-occurring in the future.",
        "Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on NASDAQ.",
        "We are an “emerging growth company” and a “smaller reporting company” under the U.S. federal securities laws, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors. ",
        "We are an “emerging growth company” and a “smaller reporting company” under U.S. federal securities laws. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company and/or a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (to the extent we continue to qualify as an emerging growth company) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company until May 2022, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30, 2021, in which case, we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2021. Even if we do not qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a smaller reporting company, which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements that are applicable to emerging growth companies. Investors may not find our common stock attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. ",
        "We expect to incur increased costs as a public company, including costs relating to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations, in the future. ",
        "When we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will be subject to additional reporting requirements as a public company, including the requirement to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  We expect that we will incur increased legal, accounting and other costs as we continue to improve existing, and implement new, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to prepare for and comply with these additional requirements.  As noted above, we may no longer qualify as an emerging growth company as early as December 31, 2021, in which case we would need to accelerate our compliance efforts and, as a result, we may incur significant additional costs in 2021. ",
        "We do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends. ",
        "The continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. Accordingly, we do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock.

Additionally, we expect these restrictions ",
