Holistic safety and business performance are interconnected, as an environment lacking emotional and psychological safety creates distraction, which may lead to workplace missteps and can result in physical accidents. At Chemours, the way in which we work is grounded in our Safety Obsession, which encompasses the physical, emotional, and psychological dimensions of safety.

It is more apparent than ever that we are all in this together, and as a company, we need to set up our employees for success and continue to cultivate their engagement with our company. We conduct an annual employee engagement survey as a means of measuring employee engagement and satisfaction, as well as a tool for improving our human capital strategies in the year ahead. Engagement is also directly correlated to the interactions our employees have with each other and their teams.

As we continue to monitor the global spread of COVID-19, we have implemented and will continue to implement measures to ensure the safety of our employees and our patients. We formed a COVID-19 Response Team, which is continuously evaluating the guidance from federal and local authorities and has created strict polices and guidelines that put our employee’s health and safety first. The EH&S management system incorporates processes to proactively assess risks to the health and safety of our employees and the community, as well as tracking compliance, incidents, inspections, and corrective actions. Our training program provides enhanced training to individuals that is parallel to the level of risk exposure to ensure that employees always have the knowledge and equipment at hand to mitigate risk. ",
        "Professional Development Programs and Opportunities: Our greatest asset is our employees and we aspire to provide them with opportunities so they can continue to grow and excel within their field, and our company. Professional growth of our employees leads to engagement and allows us to leverage opportunities so we can hire key talent from within. We have also implemented a personal development plan program, along with leadership and management development programs. Through development planning, we strive for employees at all levels to focus on strengthening the skills required in their current role or a potential future role. We conduct formal annual performance reviews for all employees, but as importantly, we are focused on building a culture of coaching, feedback and open communication between managers and their direct reports throughout the entire year. We provide managers and employees with training on how to conduct effective forward-looking performance conversations and to set effective goals that are realistic, measurable, attainable, relevant and timebound (SMART). Another example where we provide leadership and development opportunities is through the Wave Learning Series, which was developed to build awareness of all functional areas at Wave, and to expand knowledge of industry trends and other matters of interest and relevance within the biopharmaceutical industry. The Wave Learning Series is conducted through company-wide presentations by employees at various levels, providing opportunities for development and cross-functional exposure for our employees. To further assist our employees, we also offer all full-time employees the option to participate in our Education Assistance Program, where we reimburse employees for tuition and eligible expenses.",

We provide an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”), as a cost-free benefit, which is available to help employees and their household members confidentially manage everyday life, work challenges, stress, and other personal issues by providing consultation, referrals and resources.  In 2020, in light of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we partnered with our EAP provider to provide a series of virtual meetings where employees could discuss the challenges and successes they have had during these unprecedented times, and discuss the importance of staying resilient while facing uncertainty.

Hiring for diversity of thought, background and experience, and diversity of personal characteristics such as gender, race and ethnicity is intentional at Wave and continues to be an area of focus as we build our workforce. Despite the historical lack of institutional emphasis on the importance of girls and women focusing on education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (“STEM”) and the resulting disproportionate occupation by men in the STEM-educated talent pool, the Company has prioritized and hired a gender diverse workforce. As of December 31, 2020, women make up approximately 51% of our global workforce and constitute approximately 43% of management. We are also committed to building a racially and ethnically diverse workforce. As of December 31, 2020, racially diverse employees (those self-identifying as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, or being two or more races) make up approximately 42% of our global workforce and approximately 21% of management (12% of our employees did not provide us with this information).

        "Community Outreach and Engagement: Our community engagement activities are focused on seeking to better understand the lives of people living with rare disease and identifying opportunities to support the rare disease community. We believe that partnering with and understanding the lives of patients and their families differentiates Wave and enhances our ability to discover and develop potential therapies. Through collaboration with patients, families and advocacy organizations, face-to-face meetings, and participation in patient-focused conferences and community events, we aim to broaden our understanding of the needs of patients and families and incorporate those critical learnings into every aspect of our company. These insights inform the design and execution of our clinical trials, the enrichment of our corporate culture, and the development of programs and services that make a positive impact on people’s lives. Employee volunteerism is another important component of our community engagement initiatives. We partner with advocacy and service organizations to provide opportunities for employees to contribute directly to our local communities.

We seek to deliver performance-driven, market competitive reward opportunities commensurate with company and individual performance.  All employees of Wave receive base salaries, cash bonuses, new hire equity grants and annual long-term incentive grants, in addition to our generous benefits package. We believe that providing employees with an ownership interest in the Company will further strengthen the level of employee engagement. Furthermore, equity awards help align the interests of our employees with the long-term interests of our shareholders.  In addition, we have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which provides our employees with an opportunity to purchase shares of our Company at a 15% discount to the market price.

In addition, during fiscal year 2020, to bring costs in line with decreased demand caused by the pandemic, we reduced the size of our workforce by eliminating open positions and laying off approximately 5% of our associates.

Our failure to effectively renegotiate any CBAs could result in work stoppages. From time to time, we may face increased efforts to subject us to multi-location labor disputes, as individual labor agreements expire or labor disputes arise. This would place us at greater risk of being unable to continue to operate one or more facilities, possibly delaying deliveries, causing customers to seek alternative distributors, or otherwise being materially adversely affected by labor disputes. When there are labor related issues at a facility represented by a local union, sympathy strikes may occur at other facilities that are represented by other local unions. While we generally believe we have good relations with our associates, including the unions that represent some of our associates, a work stoppage due to a failure to renegotiate union contracts or for other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",
        "Further, potential changes in labor legislation and case law could result in current non-union portions of our workforce, including warehouse and delivery personnel, being subjected to greater organized labor influence. If additional portions of our workforce became subject to CBAs, this could result in increased costs of doing business as we would become subject to mandatory, binding arbitration or labor scheduling, costs and standards, which may reduce our operating flexibility.",
        "We are subject to a wide range of labor costs. Because our industry's labor costs are, as a percentage of net sales, higher than many other industries' labor costs, even if we are able to successfully renegotiate CBAs and avoid work stoppages, we may be significantly impacted by labor cost increases. In addition, labor is a significant cost of many of our customers in the U.S. food-away-from-home industry. Any increase in their labor costs, including any increases in costs as a result of increases in minimum wage requirements, could reduce the profitability of our customers and reduce their demand for our products.",
        "We may be unable to attract or retain a qualified and diverse workforce.",
        "A labor shortage could potentially increase labor costs, reduce our profitability and/or decrease our ability to effectively serve customers. In addition, in response to the decreased demand for our products and services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, during fiscal year 2020, we implemented multiple cost savings measures relating to our workforce, including temporary furloughs or hours reductions, freezing non-business critical hiring, deferring annual corporate salary and wage increases, reducing our board of directors, executive and other senior leadership compensation, and reducing the size of our workforce. While we have ended the furloughs and discontinued the temporary salary reductions, employees who were impacted by these actions may seek and find other employment.  If key personnel terminate their employment, become ill as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations, our business operations may be adversely affected.",
        "The success of our business depends on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Recruiting and retention efforts (particularly with respect to driver and warehouse personnel) and actions to increase productivity may not be successful, and we could encounter a shortage of qualified employee talent in the future. Furthermore, as a government contractor, we are subject to oversight by the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, which reviews our employment practices including affirmative action and non-discrimination based on race, sex and disability, among other characteristics. If an audit or investigation reveals a failure to comply with regulations, we could become subject to civil or criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions, including government pre-approval of our government contracting activities, termination of government contracts, and suspension or debarment from doing further business with the U.S. government and could also be subject to claims for breach of contract by our customers. Any of these actions could increase our expenses, reduce our revenue and damage our reputation as a reliable government supplier."

        "We are committed to an inclusive workforce that fully represents many different cultures, backgrounds and viewpoints. Our Team Member Resource Groups (TMRGs), which are voluntary, employee-led groups, play an integral part in our culture of inclusion as we strive to foster openness, integrity and respect. We currently have six TMRG’s: African American, Asia Pacific Islander, Hispanic Latino, LGBTQ & Friends, Military and Women’s. Each group is sponsored by a senior executive who provides leadership and helps drives initiatives across the business. In addition, we believe that multiple perspectives generate better solutions and relatability with our diverse base of customers and consumers. We strike to ensure a common inclusion that we believe is reflected in our programs and initiatives, and we regularly seek team member feedback through our annual engagement survey and ongoing discussions with our TMRG’s.",

        "Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off ",
        "On January 3, 2017, when the spin-off was completed, Hilton and Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. ceased to be related parties of HGV. In connection with the spin-off, we entered into various agreements with Hilton and Park. Certain provisions of the spin-off agreements survive the performance of the principal transactions to which they related. The following is a summary of the terms of certain agreements we entered in connection with the spin-off from Hilton, which continue to govern our ongoing relationships with Hilton and Park after the spin-off.",
        " ",
        "License Agreement",
        " ",
        "In connection with the spin-off, we entered into a license agreement with Hilton granting us the exclusive right to use, for an initial term of 100 years, to use certain Hilton marks and intellectual property in our timeshare business.  For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we incurred license fee expense of $51 million, $101 million and $98 million, respectively.    ",
        "Subject to the terms and conditions of the license agreement, Hilton has granted us the right to use the trademarks “Hilton Grand Vacations,” “HGV” and “Hilton Club” (collectively, the “Hilton Marks”) in connection with the current and future operation of a Hilton branded vacation ownership business (the “Licensed Business”).  We have also received a license or right to use certain other Hilton-owned intellectual property, including promotional content and access to Hilton’s reservation system and property management software (collectively with the Hilton Marks, the “Hilton IP”).  We also have the right to use Hilton’s loyalty program data and other customer information (“Hilton Data”) to promote the Licensed Business and for other internal business purposes, but may not disclose or sell such information to third parties without Hilton’s consent.",
        "Subject to the following two sentences, Hilton will not compete or use the Hilton IP or Hilton Data in the vacation ownership business (or license others to do so) for the first 30 years of the term of the license agreement, and we may extend this exclusivity for additional 10-year terms if we achieve certain revenue targets in the last year of the initial 30-year term or any subsequent renewal term, or make a payment to cover any revenue shortfall, for a maximum of five such payments during any 10-year renewal term.  If Hilton merges with or acquires a company that owns a vacation ownership business and a hotel business, Hilton shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow us to acquire or manage the acquired vacation ownership business.  If we do not do so, then after such acquisition by Hilton, notwithstanding the foregoing exclusivity, Hilton may use the Hilton IP, Hilton Data and Hilton’s loyalty program (but not the Hilton Marks) to allow such acquired vacation ownership business to compete with the Licensed Business for the remainder of the term of the license agreement.",
        "The initial term of the license agreement will expire on December 31, 2116.  After the initial term ends, we may continue to use the Hilton IP and Hilton Data on a non-exclusive basis for a “tail period” of 30 years in connection with products and projects that were using the foregoing rights, or were approved by Hilton for development, when the term ended, provided that we continue to comply with the terms of the license agreement, including payment of royalty and other fees.",
        "We pay a royalty fee of five percent of gross revenues to Hilton quarterly in arrears, as well as specified additional fees.  Gross revenues include our gross sales for the initial sale or re-sale of interests in the Licensed Business (subject to certain Hilton Grand Vacations Club exceptions), property operations revenue, transient rental revenue and other certain revenues earned.  We also owe Hilton an annual transition fee of $5 million for each of the first five years of the term and certain other fees and reimbursements.  The license agreement contains customary requirements with respect to our record-keeping and Hilton’s audit rights.",
        "We are required to comply with the Hilton brand standards applicable to the Licensed Business.  Hilton has inspection and approval rights to monitor our compliance with these standards. Hilton brand standards include: construction and design brand standards; graphic standards for use of the Hilton IP; sales, service and operating standards; and quality assurance and customer satisfaction requirements.",
        "11",
        " ",
        "During the term of the license agreement, we will participate in Hilton’s loyalty program, currently known as the Hilton Honors program.  We can purchase Hilton Honors points at cost for the first 20 years of the term of the license agreement, and thereafter at the market rate (with a most favored nation provision, pursuant to which such market rate is no higher than the price paid by strategic partners that purchase a comparable volume of points annually on comparable business terms).  All members of Hilton’s loyalty program have the right to redeem loyalty program points at our properties in the Licensed Business, consistent with the tiers and rules of Hilton’s current loyalty program.  We can convert points associated with our own point-based reservations and exchange system into Hilton loyalty program points through an exchange program at a conversion rate to be determined by us.  We may not participate in a loyalty program of a Hilton competitor in connection with the Licensed Business. Under our Honors program arrangement with Hilton prior to the spin-off, we purchase Hilton Honors points from Hilton based on an estimated cost per point for the costs of future club exchanges.  For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we paid Hilton $41 million, $58 million and $56 million, respectively, for Hilton Honors points.",
        "We are required to operate the Licensed Business in strict compliance with all of Hilton’s standards and guidelines and all applicable laws. We are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all necessary approvals, permits and licenses required and paying all taxes related to the Licensed Business.  We may subcontract or delegate property-level, non-management functions, including housekeeping, security and maintenance, if we comply with Hilton’s standards and guidelines. Hilton has the right to enter our vacation ownership properties at any time without notice and additional permission from us in order to verify that we are complying with the license agreement and Hilton’s standards and guidelines.",
        "We are required to comply with Hilton’s customer data privacy and security standards and protocols.  We are required to notify Hilton immediately after discovering any actual or attempted circumstances that could compromise the security of our information technology systems.  We are required to remedy any such breach at our own expense.",
        "We can operate vacation ownership properties under other brands (with no royalty due to Hilton) if we do so without using any Hilton IP or Hilton Data and they are otherwise separate operations from the Licensed Business.",
        "We are required to obtain Hilton’s consent to develop or operate any additional vacation ownership properties under the Hilton Marks (including on our own undeveloped parcels).  Hilton may not unreasonably withhold its approval for these projects as long as they comply with existing law, do not involve a co-investor that is a competitor of Hilton or is of bad moral character, and are not reasonably likely to harm Hilton, the Licensed IP or the Hilton Data.  Hilton has a right of first refusal if we want to sell an undeveloped parcel to a Hilton competitor.",
        "We have entered into an agreement with Hilton that governs the transfer of calls from Hilton to us.  Under this agreement, Hilton is required to use its reasonable best efforts to transfer calls to us at a level consistent with past practice prior to the spin-off for the first ten years.  Hilton is required to provide the call transfer services at cost for the first 30 years and at market rates thereafter.  We have entered into other agreements that govern other services that Hilton is required to provide us.",
        "Under the license agreement, our right to use the Hilton Marks as a trade, corporate, d/b/a or similar name will automatically terminate if (i) the aggregate number of units of accommodation in our Licensed Business falls below two-thirds of the total number of units of accommodation in our entire vacation ownership business; (ii) we merge with or acquire control of the assets of Marriott International, Inc., Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, Wyndham Destinations and Interval Leisure Group, Inc. or their respective affiliates and we or they use their brands in any business after such acquisition; or (iii) we become an affiliate of another Hilton competitor.",
        "Hilton has the right to terminate the license agreement as a whole if, among other things: (i) we file for bankruptcy or cease business operations; (ii) 25 percent or more of our Hilton-branded vacation ownership properties fail certain performance thresholds or the overall customer satisfaction score for all our Hilton-branded vacation ownership properties falls below a certain threshold level, and we do not promptly cure such failures; (iii) we operate the Licensed Business in a way that has a material adverse effect on Hilton; (iv) we fail to pay certain amounts due to Hilton (and in certain cases, do not promptly cure such failures); (v) we contest Hilton’s ownership of the Hilton IP or the Hilton Data; (vi) we merge with, consolidate with or are acquired by a competitor of Hilton; or (vii) we assign the agreement to a non-affiliate without Hilton’s consent.",
        "12",
        " ",
        "Hilton also has the right to “deflag” (prevent use of any Hilton IP or Hilton Data at) any property in our Licensed Business in certain circumstances, including if (i) a $10 million or more final judgment is assessed against such property or a foreclosure suit is initiated against such property and not vacated; (ii) an ongoing threat or danger to public health or safety occurs at such property; (iii) such property fails to meet certain quality assurance system performance thresholds; or (iv) such property is not operated in compliance with the license agreement or Hilton’s other standards and agreements, and such breaches are not cured in accordance with the license agreement.",
        "If we breach our obligations under the license agreement, Hilton may, in addition to terminating the license agreement, be entitled to (depending on the nature of the breach): seek injunctive relief and/or monetary damages; suspend our access to and terminate our rights to use Licensed IP and/or Hilton Data (other than the Hilton Marks and certain other content); or terminate our rights to use the Licensed IP (including the Hilton Marks) and Hilton Data at specific locations that are not in compliance with performance standards.",
        "If the license agreement terminates due to our fault before the end of the term, we are required to cease use of the Hilton IP and Hilton Data according to a specified schedule.  Hilton has the right to demand liquidated damages based upon its uncollected royalties and fees for the remainder of the term.",
        "Hilton has registered certain of the Hilton Marks for vacation ownership services in jurisdictions in which we currently operate vacation ownership resorts and residential projects under the Hilton Marks.  However, Hilton does not have affirmative trademark rights in the Hilton Marks in relation to every aspect of our business in every country around the world, and we, therefore, may not be able to use one or more of the Hilton Marks to expand various aspects of our business into one or more new countries.  If we want to use a Hilton Mark in a country where it is not registered, we will have to seek Hilton’s consent, which may not be withheld if the new trademark would not reasonably be expected to harm or jeopardize the value, validity, reputation or goodwill of the Hilton Marks or subject Hilton to any risk of legal liability.",
        "Unless we obtain Hilton’s prior written consent, we may not be able to: (i) merge with or acquire a Hilton competitor or a vacation ownership business that has entered into an operating agreement with a Hilton competitor; (ii) merge with or acquire a vacation ownership business together with a lodging business; or (iii) be acquired or combined with any entity other than an affiliate.  We may acquire control of a business that is not a vacation ownership business or a lodging business without Hilton’s consent, but we are required to operate such business as a separate operation that does not use the Hilton IP or Hilton Data unless Hilton consents to such use.  Without Hilton’s prior consent, we may not assign our rights under the license agreement, except to one our affiliates as part of an internal reorganization for tax or administrative purposes.",
        "We are required to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Hilton from and against any claim or liability resulting from (i) third-party claims based on (a) our breach of the license agreement; (b) the operation of our vacation ownership properties; (c) any use of the Hilton IP or Hilton Data in violation of the license agreement and (d) any use of any content provided to us pursuant to the license agreement; or (ii) claims based on any security breach of our systems and/or unauthorized use or disclosure of Hilton Data.",

        "Distribution Agreement",
        "We entered into a Distribution Agreement with Hilton and Park (the “Distribution Agreement”) in connection with the spin-off. The Distribution Agreement provided for certain transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities by each of Hilton, HGV and Park and the settlement or extinguishment of certain liabilities and other obligations among Hilton, HGV and Park. In addition, HGV, Hilton and Park agreed that losses related to certain contingent liabilities (and related costs and expenses) that generally are not specifically attributable to any of the separated real estate business, the timeshare business or the retained business of Hilton (“Shared Contingent Liabilities”) will be apportioned among the parties according to fixed percentages of 65 percent, 26 percent and nine percent for Hilton, Park and HGV, respectively. Costs and expenses of, and indemnification obligations to, third party professional advisors arising out of the foregoing actions also may be subject to these provisions. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, Hilton will generally be vested with the exclusive management and control of all matters pertaining to any such Shared Contingent Liabilities. To date, there have been no contingent liabilities subject to these provisions since the spin-off. The Distribution Agreement also provides for cross-indemnities that, except as otherwise provided in the Distribution Agreement, are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of each business with the appropriate company.

        "Tax Matters Agreement ",
        "We have entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Hilton and Park (the “Tax Matters Agreement”) that governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Hilton, Park and us after the spin-off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns.  Although binding between the parties, the Tax Matters Agreement is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).  We and Park each will continue to have several liabilities with Hilton to the IRS for the consolidated U.S. federal income taxes of the Hilton consolidated group relating to the taxable periods in which we and Park were part of that group.  The Tax Matters Agreement specifies the portion, if any, of this tax liability for which we and Park will bear responsibility, and each party has agreed to indemnify the other two parties against any amounts for which they are not responsible.  The Tax Matters Agreement also provides special rules for allocating tax liabilities in the event that the spin-off is not tax-free.  In general, under the Tax Matters Agreement, each party is responsible for any taxes imposed on Hilton that arise from the failure of the spin-off and certain related transactions to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, as applicable, and certain other relevant provisions of the Code, to the extent that the failure to qualify is attributable to actions taken by such party (or with respect to such party’s stock).  The parties share responsibility, in accordance with sharing percentages applicable to Shared Contingent Liabilities, for any such taxes imposed on Hilton that are not attributable to actions taken by a party. In addition, to the extent that any taxes that may be imposed on the Hilton consolidated group for the taxable periods prior to the spin-offs relates to our timeshare business, we would be liable for the full amount under the Tax Matters Agreement.",

Other potential impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on our various clinical trials include patient dosing and study monitoring, which may be paused or delayed due to changes in policies at various clinical sites, federal, state, local or foreign laws, rules and regulations, including quarantines or other travel restrictions, prioritization of healthcare resources toward pandemic efforts, including diminished attention of physicians serving as our clinical trial investigators and reduced availability of site staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials, interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA, or other reasons related to the coronavirus pandemic. The FDA recently published guidance on manufacturing investigational cellular and gene therapy products during the COVID-19 pandemic and provided risk-based recommendations to minimize potential transmission of the coronavirus to patients and facility personnel. The FDA expects manufacturers to evaluate whether the coronavirus poses new risks in the context of their specific products, facilities, processes, and manufacturing controls, and identify and mitigate factors that may allow for transmission of the coronavirus to patients and facility personnel and include a description of the risk assessment and mitigation strategies in any IND and BLA. If the coronavirus pandemic continues, other aspects of our clinical trials may be adversely affected, delayed or interrupted, including, for example, site initiation, patient recruitment and enrollment, availability of clinical trial materials, and data analysis. Some patients and clinical investigators may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols and patients may choose to withdraw from our studies or we may have to pause enrollment or we may choose to or be required to pause enrollment and or patient dosing in our ongoing clinical trials in order to preserve health resources and protect trial participants.

Since March 2020, foreign and domestic inspections by the FDA have largely been on hold with the FDA announcing plans in July 2020 to resume prioritized domestic inspections. Should the FDA determine that an inspection is necessary for approval of a marketing application and an inspection cannot be completed during the review cycle due to restrictions on travel, the FDA has stated that it generally intends to issue a complete response letter. Further, if there is inadequate information to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility, the FDA may defer action on the application until an inspection can be completed. In 2020, several companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA's inability to complete required inspections for their applications.

        "Each “Ten Percent Shareholder” (as defined below) in a non-U.S. corporation that is classified as a “controlled foreign corporation,” or a CFC, for United States federal income tax purposes generally is required to include in income for U.S. federal tax purposes such Ten Percent Shareholder’s pro rata share of the CFC’s “Subpart F income” and investment of earnings in U.S. property, even if the CFC has made no distributions to its shareholders. Subpart F income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties, gains from the sale of securities and income from certain transactions with related parties. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, each Ten Percent Shareholder of a CFC is also required to include in income such Ten Percent Shareholder’s share of “global intangible low-taxed income” with respect to such CFC. In addition, a Ten Percent Shareholder that realizes gain from the sale or exchange of shares in a CFC may be required to classify a portion of such gain as dividend income rather than capital gain. A non-U.S. corporation generally will be classified as a CFC for United States federal income tax purposes if Ten Percent Shareholders own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of either the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation entitled to vote or of the total value of the stock of such corporation. A “Ten Percent Shareholder” is a United States person (as defined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, who owns or is considered to own 10% or more of (1) the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or (2) the value of all classes of stock of such corporation.

We implemented various measures to protect our seafarers and shore-based personnel and reduce the spread of the virus.

We leveraged our IT infrastructure and various technology tools to enable our shore-based personnel to work seamlessly from home.

        "The IMO’s third study of GHG emissions from the global shipping fleet which concluded in 2014 predicted that, in the absence of appropriate policies, greenhouse emissions from ships may increase by 50% to 250% by 2050 due to expected growth in international seaborne trade. Methane emissions are projected to increase rapidly (albeit from a low base) as the share of LNG in the fuel mix increases. With respect to energy efficiency measures, the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (“MEPC”) adopted guidelines on the Energy Efficiency Design Index (“EEDI”), which reflects the primary fuel for the calculation of the attained EEDI for ships having dual fuel engines using LNG and liquid fuel oil (see discussion below). The IMO is committed to developing limits on greenhouse gases from international shipping and is working on proposed mandatory technical and operational measures to achieve these limits. In April 2018, IMO adopted an initial strategy on the reduction of GHG emissions from ships, with the ultimate goal of eliminating GHG emissions from international shipping as soon as possible during this century. More specifically, under the identified “levels of ambition,” the initial strategy envisages the halt of the growth in GHG emissions from international shipping as soon as possible and then the reduction of the total annual GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels.  In 2019, the IMO launched a project for an initial two-year period to initiate and promote global efforts to demonstrate and test technical solutions for reducing GHG emissions and improve energy efficiency throughout the maritime sector.

To this end, IMO is in the process of crafting the 2023 measures and it is expected that these measures will include vessel design and efficient operation.

We have a multifaceted talent development framework that includes functional training, management training and targeted development problems, such as our Six Sigma training that aims to further enhance operational skills in our Government Solutions business unit. We also develop our employees through an annual performance review and assessment process that incorporates a dual-performance rating system and provides each employee with concrete, actionable feedback that will enable them to succeed at our Company.  ",

        "Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who have critical experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan and growth strategy. Additionally, as our business grows, we may need to attract and hire additional management personnel. We have employment agreements with some members of senior management that include non-competition provisions; however, we cannot prevent our executives from terminating their employment and may not be able to fully enforce non-competition provisions limiting former executives from competing with us following any departure. Moreover, we do not carry “key-man” life insurance on the lives of our executive officers, employees or advisors. Our ability to retain our key management personnel or to identify and attract additional management personnel or suitable replacements should any members of the management team leave or be terminated is dependent on a number of factors, including the competitive nature of the employment market and our industry. Any failure to retain key management personnel or to attract additional or suitable replacement personnel could cause uncertainty among investors, employees, customers and others concerning our future direction and performance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

        "Our business depends on highly skilled technical, managerial, engineering, sales, marketing and customer support personnel and qualified and competent subcontractors. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially during times of low unemployment or economic recovery or growth. Any failure to attract, hire, assimilate in a timely manner and retain and motivate key qualified personnel, particularly software development, product development, analytics and other technical personnel, or inability to contract with qualified, competent subcontractors, could impair our success. Additionally, certain portions of our Government Solutions operations are dependent on employees who are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. When the collective bargaining agreement becomes subject to renegotiation or if we face union organizing drives, any disagreement between us and the union on important issues may lead to a strike, work slowdown or other job actions in one or more locations we serve. A strike, work slowdown or other job action could disrupt our services, resulting in reduced revenues or contract cancellations. State or local law in some jurisdictions requires that subcontractors for our Government Solutions segment are certified by the jurisdiction, and the failure on the part of our subcontractors to obtain and maintain such certification could impact their ability to perform services for us. Further, our acquisition activity could increase the challenge of retaining our key employees and subcontractors and those of the acquired businesses. The loss of any key technical employee or the termination of a key subcontractor relationship, and any inability to identify suitable replacements or offer reasonable terms to these candidates, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (“TCA”), finally agreed to between the EU and UK on December 24, 2020, came into force on January 1, 2021, and is expected to be formally approved by the EU legislature in March 2021. The TCA goes some way to liberalizing trade in goods between the UK and EU. However, in terms of trade in services, cooperation between national authorities, and business travel, the TCA introduces rules that are far more restrictive than those offered by membership in the EU’s Single Market, and the overall impact on the movement of goods, services, people and capital between the U.K. and the EU, as well as customer behavior, economic conditions, interest rates, currency exchange rates, availability of capital or other matters remains to be seen. Economists predict that Brexit will lead to some short-term disruption in the UK and a longer-term reduction in GDP. The impact of more restrictive rules, including additional inspections and documentation checks, on cross-border services may have an impact on our wholly owned subsidiary, EPC, as their effects become clearer. Also, the inability for the UK and EU vehicle licensing authorities to transfer certain data using current methods may have an impact on EPC’s ability to obtain information that is necessary to its operations in certain parts of the EU. These restrictions may have an impact on EPC’s ability to obtain information that is necessary to its operations in certain parts of the EU. In addition, EPC’s ability to obtain information from its customers outside the UK may also be adversely impacted. The EU has agreed under the TCA to allow EU personal data to be transferred to the UK for up to six additional months on current terms, pending an expected ‘adequacy’ decision in June 2021, which will allow permanent free flow of personal data.

In many of these markets, long-standing relationships between potential customers and their local partners and protective regulations, including local content requirements and approvals, and disparate networks and systems used by each country, will create barriers to entry. Difficulties in foreign financial markets and economies and of foreign financial institutions, particularly in emerging markets, could also adversely affect demand in the affected areas.

        "On March 27, 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) to address the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "The CARES Act appropriated $349.0 billion for PPP loans and on April 24, 2020, the PPP received another $310.0 billion in funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act appropriated $284.0 billion for both first and second draw PPP loans, bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. PPP is scheduled to end on May 31, 2021, unless extended by further legislation. Loans under the PPP that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had received SBA approval for over 1,000 PPP applications, of which the Bank disbursed 957 loans totaling $85.3 million. PPP loans have a two-year or five-year term, provide for fees of up to 5% of the loan amount and earn interest at a rate of 1% per annum. It is our expectation that a significant portion of these loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. These loans resulted in $3.1 million in gross processing fee income to be recognized over the life of the respective loans. The average authorized loan size is $89,000 and the median authorized loan size is $17,000. We have estimated that approximately 10,918 jobs have been positively impacted. The Bank, both an MDI and a CDFI, made 957 PPP loans in the amount of $85.3 million significantly exceeding the reported average MDI/CDFI performance.",
        "In conjunction with the PPP, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) has created a lending facility for qualified financial institutions. The Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility will extend credit to depository institutions until June 30, 2021, unless the Board and the Department of Treasury determine to extend the Facility at an interest rate of 0.35%. Only loans issued under the PPP can be pledged as collateral to access the facility.",
        "Although New York is no longer the hotbed of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the Company continues to alter the way it has historically provided services to its deposit customers while seeking to maintain normal day-to-day back-office operations and lending functions. To that end, all back-office and lending personnel continue to work in a remote work environment while the branch network continues to provide traditional banking services to its communities and has for the most part returned to normal operating hours while continuing to shift service delivery to electronic and web-based products. The Company continues its extensive and intensive communications program geared to informing customers of the alternative resources provided by the Company for retaining access to financial services, closing loans and conducting banking transactions, such as ATM networks, online banking, mobile applications, remote deposits and the Company’s Contact Center. The Company proactively manages its day-to-day operations by using video and telephonic conferencing. Currently, the Company is renovating its office spaces to make these more accessible with employees’ working environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Of those 412 loans, 339 loans aggregating $306.5 million are no longer in deferment and continue performing and 73 loans in the amount of $73.8 million remained in deferment. Of the 73 loans in deferment, 72 loans in the amount of $73.5 million are in renewed forbearance and one loan in the amount of $297,000 is in its original forbearance. All of these loans had been performing in accordance with their contractual obligations prior to the granting of the initial forbearance. The Company actively monitors the business activities of borrowers in forbearance and seeks to determine their capacity to resume payments as contractually obligated upon the termination of the forbearance period. The initial and extended forbearances are short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in furtherance of governmental policies. ",

        "Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management and that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for loan losses.",
        "The allowance for loan losses is established as probable incurred losses are estimated to occur through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.",
        "The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of the Company’s assets and liabilities and results of operations.

Significant one-time costs were incurred to implement the upgrades.",

These services range from on-line banking, mobile banking, bill pay, positive pay, remote deposit capture, cash management services, e-statements, data storage and management, ACH services, social media capabilities, electronic document storage, a paperless environment and VoIP telecommunications with an automation-based, dual-language Customer Contact Center. The expansion of electronic banking capabilities was accomplished largely with minimal additional operating expenses as a result of renegotiations of the Company’s core processing arrangements. Importantly, these services enabled the Company to continue serving its customers as they, and the Company, switched to remote work environments. ",

Additionally, the Company protected its asset quality by increasing ALLL by $2.5 million in response to plausible the COVID-19 pandemic repercussions.

The product, Grain, is a mobile application geared to the underbanked and new generations entering the financial services market that uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans to consumers, with credit lines currently not to exceed $1,000. Grain services the loans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank’s origination and servicing standards. To the extent such standards are not maintained, Grain is responsible for any related losses. As of December 31, 2020, the Company, pursuant to its partnership with Grain, has originated 37,858 consumer loans with balances totaling $25.5 million and 8,693 deposit accounts totaling $1.8 million. The Company is also finalizing a Fintech-based small business automated lending product in partnership with LendingFront Technologies, Inc. The product is mobile application that enables the Company to originate, close and fund small business loans within very short spans of time, without requiring a physical presence within banking offices with automated underwriting using non-traditional methods. The Company expects that all of its Commercial Relationship Officers and Business Development Managers will utilize these capabilities upon the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It has involved the redesign of its retail branches, the shift of branch operations to a centralized back office, the deployment of smart ITM-enabled ATMs and Teller Cash Recyclers, the automation of manual processes and, importantly, the adoption of universal bankers and retail sales. In 2019, the Company earned national recognition as Branch Innovators of the Year for its retail banking model at the 2019 Future Branches Retail Banking Summit in Austin, Texas. The Company has completed the redesign and renovation of two branches at a buildout cost of $2.4 million, including the relocation of one branch to a smaller footprint.

        "The Company anticipates renovating most, if not all of its branches over the next 18 months, at costs significantly less than previous efforts largely as a result of economies of scale, design modifications and adoption of buildout techniques used by non-bank retail organizations. The project to fully renovate our Flatlands branch was completed in late November 2020 on time and within the original budget of $356,000 despite modifications made to the original design and construction process related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bidding to renovate the Bank’s Riverdale branch into a new flagship recapturing space that had previously been subleased is complete and the project has been awarded for a contract cost of $1.5 million. Construction commenced on this project on March 1, 2021 and should be completed early in the third quarter of 2021. A bid has also been accepted for renovation of our Astoria branch with construction scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2021. The awarded contract is $315,000. The Company expects to incorporate into its retail branches mortgage origination personnel, now that the acquisition of Mortgage World has been completed, and plans to create kiosk branches in certain of Mortgage World’s current locations while creating a full service branch at the site of a Mortgage World mortgage office located in Flushing, Queens, New York.

As of December 31, 2020, the initiative has resulted in an investment of $808,000, with over 6,909 net new deposit accounts with balances of $142.8 million, excluding deposit accounts opened as a result of PPP lending. Vision 2020 will enable the Company to manage the process of returning to more normal operations upon governmental authorities adopting enabling pronouncements.

        "Our workforce is critical to our success. We seek out employees who are passionate about pop culture, our products and our business, and who can help us build strong relationships with our partners, customers, fans and local communities. Pop culture changes constantly, and we look to build teams that are nimble and can execute in our fast-paced environment. We strive to foster a sense of community with our employees and make the workplace fun despite the demands of our rapidly changing business. We believe our passion for pop culture of all forms is reflected in our fans around the world.  We believe that fully serving those fans requires a diverse and inclusive workforce. We have implemented programs to advance these principles and embrace the opportunity to work with people of diverse backgrounds and perspectives.",
        "In addition to offering market competitive salaries and wages, we offer comprehensive health and 401(k) benefits to eligible employees. Our core benefits packages are supplemented with specific programs centered around voluntary benefits, paid time away from work and employee physical and mental wellbeing. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes adopting remote work policies for our corporate employees as appropriate, while also implementing significant safety measures designed to protect the health of all those working at or entering our distribution centers, retail outlets and other facilities that have remained open during the pandemic.",
        "As of December 31, 2020, we employed 777 full-time employees. We employed 617 people in the United States, 151 people in Europe and 9 people in Asia. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages.

Any of these factors may have a materially adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in managing our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and vendors have unionized workforces.

        "— We believe that creating a work environment where employees feel welcome, supported and valued results in increased employee engagement and reduced turnover. In order to achieve these goals we carefully observe all applicable laws and have adopted and actively enforce policies in our employee handbook and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that ensure equal employment opportunities for all and prohibit harassment and discrimination of any kind. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires adherence to the highest standards of personal integrity and assures the protection of human rights. We have a compliance hotline so that employees can report any violation of these policies, anonymously if they wish. In 2020, we created a diversity committee which is in the process of creating diversity and inclusion goals and strategies. We treat each of our employees with the same high level of respect regardless of such employee’s age, color, disability, ethnicity, family or marital status, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, physical and mental ability, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, veteran status or other characteristics that make such employee unique. As reflected in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we are committed to working in partnership with vendors and other business partners directly linked to our operations that share our commitment to these same principles. ",
        "— Prioritizing safety protects our workforce, our stakeholders and the communities in which we operate. We therefore hold ourselves to the highest standards for responsible and reliable performance, striving to achieve safe, effective and efficient operations. We foster a culture of safety by providing employees with in-depth, role-appropriate safety training upon hiring and as part of the continuous development of our employees. Each employee receives annual Talos-specific refresher safety training, and we conduct triweekly field safety meetings with all offshore employees where they hear directly from senior management and discuss safety culture. After any serious incident we reach out to all offshore employees with a lessons learned report following an in-depth incident investigation process and follow-up throughout the year to ensure any resulting changes to safety protocols are implemented. The Company incentivizes employees to focus on conducting operations in accordance with our strict safety standards and encourages employees to immediately report any breach of safety protocol to their supervisor or our compliance hotline. Safety performance is an element of each employee’s performance review and 10% of the value of the 2020 short-term incentive award pool was based upon the Company’s achievement of safety goals. Additionally, our offshore employees are eligible to receive a quarterly safety bonus, the value of which is contingent upon active observation and recording of safety behaviors (whether good or in need of improvement) and the number of safety or environmental incidents of non-compliance recorded at the employee’s facility location during the quarter. Finally, many of our offshore employees participate in our ESG sub-committees so that they can have a voice in corporate-level decisions about ESG matters. Our employees are empowered and obligated by our Chief Executive Officer to exercise the Stop Work Authority (“SWA”). With the SWA, our employees can call an immediate stop to any work for any safety concern without fear of retaliation or intimidation.",

This is one of the reasons why every year since our inception, we have earned a ranking as a Top Workplace on the Houston Chronicle Top Workplaces list. We implement an inclusive and dynamic recruiting process that utilizes online recruiting platforms, referrals, internships and professional recruiters. We foster the growth and professional development of our employees through the use of a robust performance review process, which includes the creation of performance development goals and plans to achieve those goals in order to help each employee reach their full potential. We also offer in-house training and reimburse the costs of outside training in further support of developing our employees. In early 2020, we launched a tuition reimbursement policy to support our employees’ pursuit of higher education at accredited institutions. We believe this emphasis on development and training has contributed to our 3.1% turnover rate for 2020.",

In response to the COVID – 19 pandemic, we transitioned office-based employees to a work from home schedule and increased safety measures and protocols for those employees choosing to report to the office, such as mandatory temperature checks, limiting third party visitors, encouraging the use of masks and social distancing. For our employees offshore, we increased pre-departure screenings, which included symptom reporting questionnaires, contact tracing, temperature screenings, and in some cases, negative COVID-19 tests.

        "Capital",
        "We and the Bank are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on our and the Bank's capital levels. The relevant capital measures are the total risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, common equity Tier 1 or “CET1” capital ratio, as well as, the leverage capital ratio.",
        "The Federal Reserve has risk-based capital rules for bank holding companies and the OCC has similar rules for national banks. These rules required at year end 2020 a minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) and capital conservation buffer of 10.50%. Tier 1 capital includes common equity and related retained earnings and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock, less goodwill and certain core deposit intangibles. Voting common equity must be the predominant form of capital. Tier 2 capital consists of non-qualifying preferred stock, qualifying subordinated, perpetual, and/or mandatory convertible debt, term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock, up to 45% of pre-tax unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable market values that are prudently valued, and a loan loss allowance up to 1.25% of its standardized total risk-weighted assets, excluding the allowance. We collectively refer to Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital as Total risk-based capital.",
        "In addition, the Federal Reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies, which provide for a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average quarterly assets (“leverage ratio”) equal to 4%. However, regulators expect bank holding companies and banks to operate with leverage ratios above the minimum. The guidelines also provide that institutions experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it will continue to consider a “tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio” (deducting all intangibles) in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activity. Higher capital may be required in individual cases and depending upon a bank holding company’s risk profile. All bank holding companies and banks are expected to hold capital commensurate with the level and nature of their risks, including the volume and severity of their problem loans. The level of Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets is becoming more widely used by the bank regulators to measure capital adequacy. Neither the Federal Reserve nor the OCC has advised us of any specific minimum leverage ratio or tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio applicable to the Company or the Bank, respectively. Under Federal Reserve policies, bank holding companies are generally expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios. The Federal Reserve believes the risk-based ratios do not fully take into account the quality of capital and interest rate, liquidity, market and operational risks. Accordingly, supervisory assessments of capital adequacy may differ significantly from conclusions based solely on the level of an organization’s risk-based capital ratio.",

Non-advanced approaches institutions were permitted to implement the Capital Simplifications Final Rule as of its revised effective date in the quarter beginning January 1, 2020, or wait until the quarter beginning April 1, 2020. As of the date of implementation, the required deductions from regulatory capital CET1 elements for mortgage servicing assets (“MSAs”) and temporary difference deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) are only required to the extent these assets exceed 25% of CET1 capital elements, less any adjustments and deductions (the “CET1 Deduction Threshold”). MSAs and temporary difference DTAs that are not deducted from capital are assigned a 250% risk weight. Investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions are deducted from capital when these exceed the 25% CET1 Deduction Threshold. Minority interests in up to 10% of the parent banking organization’s CET1, Tier capital and total capital, after deductions and adjustments are permitted to be included in capital effective October 1, 2019. Also, effective October 1, 2019, the final rule made various technical amendments, including reconciling a difference in the capital rules and the bank holding company rules that permits the redemption of bank holding company common stock without prior Federal Reserve approval under the capital rules. Such redemptions remain subject to other requirements, including the BHC Act and Federal Reserve Regulation Y. The Company adopted these simplified capital rules in the first quarter of 2020 and had no material effect on the Company’s regulatory capital and ratios.",

FDICIA establishes five capital categories for insured deposit institutions: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital category will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. To qualify as a “well-capitalized” institution, a bank must have a leverage ratio of not less than 5%, a Tier 1 Common Equity ratio of not less than 6.5%, a Tier 1 Capital ratio of not less than 8%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of not less than 10%, and the bank must not be under any order or directive from the appropriate regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level.",

The degree of regulatory scrutiny of a financial institution will increase, and the permissible activities of the institution will decrease, as it moves downward through the capital categories.",
        "Immediately upon becoming undercapitalized, a depository institution becomes subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act which: (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the FDIC’s DIF.",

Under the final rules, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio of greater than 9%, off-balance-sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated assets and trading assets plus trading liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets, are deemed “qualifying community banking organizations” and are eligible to opt into the “community bank leverage ratio framework.” A qualifying community banking organization that elects to use the community bank leverage ratio framework and that maintains a leverage ratio of greater than 9% is considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules and, if applicable, is considered to have met the “well capitalized” ratio requirements for purposes of its primary federal regulator’s prompt corrective action rules, discussed above. The final rules include a two-quarter grace period during which a qualifying community banking organization that temporarily fails to meet any of the qualifying criteria, including the greater-than-9% leverage capital ratio requirement, is generally still deemed “well capitalized” so long as the banking organization maintains a leverage capital ratio greater than 8%. A banking organization that fails to maintain a leverage capital ratio greater than 8% is not permitted to use the grace period and must comply with the generally applicable requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules and file the appropriate regulatory reports.

This could include enhanced strategic planning, CRE underwriting policies, risk management, internal controls, portfolio stress testing and risk exposure limits as well as appropriately designed compensation and incentive programs. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The guidance provides the following criteria regulatory agencies will use as indicators to identify institutions that may be exposed to CRE concentration risk: (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending ; (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE; (iii) Total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land of 100% or more of a bank’s total risk-based capital; or (iv) Total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land are 300% or more of a bank’s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the institutions CRE portfolio has increased by 50% or more in the prior 36 months. We have always had significant exposures to loans secured by CRE due to the nature of our markets. We believe our long term experience in CRE lending, underwriting policies, internal controls, and other policies currently in place, as well as our loan and credit monitoring and administration procedures, are generally appropriate to manage our concentrations as required under the guidance.",

In 2014, a committee of private-market derivative participants and their regulators, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, or “ARRC,” was convened by the Federal Reserve to identify an alternative reference interest rate to replace LIBOR. In June 2017, the ARRC announced the Secured Overnight Funding Rate, or “SOFR,” a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative to LIBOR. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. In April 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began to publish SOFR rates on a daily basis.

On June 5, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (the “Flexibility Act”) was enacted, which among other things, gave borrowers additional time and flexibility to use PPP loan proceeds, and made significant changes to the PPP to provide additional relief for small businesses. The Flexibility Act increased flexibility for small businesses that have been unable to rehire employees due to lack of employee availability, or have been unable to operate as normal due to COVID-19 related restrictions, extended the period that businesses have to use PPP funds to qualify for loan forgiveness to 24 weeks, up from 8 weeks under the original rules, and relaxed the requirements that loan recipients must adhere to in order to qualify for loan forgiveness. In addition, the Flexibility Act extended the payment deferral period for PPP loans until the date when the amount of loan forgiveness is determined and remitted to the lender.  For PPP recipients who do not apply for forgiveness, the loan deferral period is 10 months after the applicable forgiveness period ends. On July 4, 2020, Congress enacted a new law to extend the deadline for applying for a PPP loan to August 8, 2020.

Cigna also offers an education reimbursement program for both full and part-time employees who meet the continuing education criteria. We believe these strategies and programs contribute to employee engagement and retention. In 2020, the voluntary turnover rate was 3.9% for exempt employees in the United States.",

Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in regulatory agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease-and-desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company.",
        "Activity Limitations.   Bank holding companies are generally restricted to engaging in the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and certain other activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking. In addition, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any nonbanking activity or terminate its ownership or control of any nonbank subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company.",

The BHC Act requires that a bank holding company obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any additional bank or bank holding company, (ii) taking any action that causes an additional bank or bank holding company to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. The Federal Reserve may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider: (1) the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including performance under the Community Reinvestment Act (\"CRA\"); and (4) the effectiveness of the companies in combatting money laundering.",

Upon receipt of such notice, the bank regulatory agencies may approve or disapprove the acquisition. The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a person or group acquires the power to vote 10% or more of our outstanding common stock. The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of the Company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies.

The banking agencies issued proposed rules in 2011 and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies. In 2016, the Federal Reserve and the OCC also proposed rules that would, depending upon the assets of the institution, directly regulate incentive compensation arrangements and would require enhanced oversight and recordkeeping.

Public companies must give shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation at least every three years and the opportunity to vote on frequency at least every six years, indicating whether the say-on-pay vote should be held annually, biennially, or triennially.

        "Capital Requirements",
        "The Bank is required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the federal banking agencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risks arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on our capital levels.",
        "The Bank is subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, retained earnings, and certain qualifying minority interests, less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt, other preferred stock and certain hybrid capital instruments, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, certain “high volatility” commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings.",
        "The leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. The required minimum leverage ratio for all banks is 4.0%.",
        "16",
        "Table of Contents",
        "In addition, the capital rules require a capital conservation buffer of up to 2.5% above each of the minimum capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital), which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. These buffer requirements must be met for a bank to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without restriction.",
        "The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: “well capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized”, and “critically undercapitalized”. A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC, are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans for regulatory approval. A depository institution’s holding company must guarantee any required capital restoration plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5 percent of the depository institution’s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. Federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. The Bank was well capitalized at December 31, 2020, and brokered deposits are not restricted.",
        "To be well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios:",
        "Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. For example, only a well-capitalized depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth.",
        "In 2020, the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were above the applicable well-capitalized standards and met the then-applicable capital conservation buffer. Based on current estimates, we believe that the Bank will continue to exceed all applicable well-capitalized regulatory capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer in 2021.",
        "The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”) signed into law in May 2018 scaled back certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and provided other regulatory relief. Among the provisions of the Economic Growth Act was a requirement that the Federal Reserve raise the asset threshold for those bank holding companies subject to the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (“Policy Statement”) to $3 billion. As a result, as of the effective date of that change in 2018, the Company was no longer required to comply with the risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank as described above.

        "As a result of the Economic Growth Act, the federal banking agencies were also required to develop a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. A “qualifying community bank” that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered “well capitalized” under prompt corrective action statutes. The federal banking agencies may consider a financial institutions risk profile when evaluation whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the capital ratio requirement. The federal banking agencies set the minimum capital for the new Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 9%. The Bank does not intend to opt into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework.",
        "On December 21, 2018, federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the upcoming implementation of the “current expected credit losses” (“CECL”) accounting standard under GAAP; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations. for more information regarding Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, which introduced CECL as the methodology to replace the current “incurred loss” methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost, and changed the approaches for recognizing and recording credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased credit impaired financial assets, including the required implementation date for the Company, see the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.",
        "Payment of Dividends",
        "We are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and our other subsidiaries. Our primary source of cash, other than securities offerings, is dividends from the Bank. The prior approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank (such as the Bank) in any calendar year will exceed the sum of such bank’s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. Federal law also prohibits any national bank from paying dividends that would be greater than such bank’s undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debts in excess of such bank’s allowance for possible loan losses.",
        "In addition, we and the Bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal bank regulatory authority may prohibit the payment of dividends where it has determined that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The OCC and the Federal Reserve have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsound and unsafe banking practice. The OCC and the Federal Reserve have each indicated that depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.",
        "Under a Federal Reserve policy adopted in 2009, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position, and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios, such as potential events that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if:",

        "As a national bank, our primary bank subsidiary, Bank First, N.A., is subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the OCC and is subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC and, accordingly, the Bank is also subject to certain FDIC regulations and the FDIC has backup examination authority and some enforcement powers over the Bank. The Bank also is subject to certain Federal Reserve regulations.",
        "In addition, as discussed in more detail below, the Bank and any other of our subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products and services are subject to regulation and potential supervision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Authority to supervise and examine the Company and the Bank for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. The CFPB also may participate in examinations of our other direct or indirect subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products or services. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce certain federal consumer financial protection rules adopted by the CFPB. As the Company and the Bank each had less than $10 billion in consolidated assets in 2020, they are not subject to the routine supervision of the CFPB, but this may change in the future as the Company and the Bank grow.",

The Bank is subject to restrictions on extensions of credit and certain other transactions between the Bank and the Company or any nonbank affiliate. Generally, these covered transactions with either the Company or any affiliate are limited to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus, and all such transactions between the Bank and the Company and all of its nonbank affiliates combined are limited to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. Loans and other extensions of credit from the Bank to the Company or any affiliate generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. In addition, any transaction between the Bank and the Company or any affiliate are required to be on an arm’s length basis. Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on certain extensions of credit by insured banks, such as the Bank, to their directors, executive officers and principal shareholders.",

In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including those of the parent bank holding company.",

The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.",
        "Anti-Money Laundering. A continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act broadened the application of anti-money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as broker-dealers, investment advisors and insurance companies, and strengthened the ability of the U.S. government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal provisions of Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act require that regulated financial institutions: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components; (ii) comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account; (iii) take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned accounts; and (iv) perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act's requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.

The agreement generally governs, among other things, the subject employees’ compensation, vacation, severance, and working conditions and contains a “no-strike” clause, whereby, during the term of the agreement, the union will not strike and we will not initiate a lockout. On March 11, 2020, we and the OPEIU entered into an Amended and Restated Collective Bargaining Agreement, which (i) extended the term of the collective bargaining agreement to June 30, 2023, (ii) provided for a 3% wage increase effective the 1st of July 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and (iii) reflected the minimum hourly wage increase of $20 per hour or $39,000 annually for entry level positions while also increasing the minimum hourly and annual salary for all subsequent union grade levels.

We seek to hire and retain highly talented employees and empower them to create value for our stockholders. In our employee recruitment and selection process and operation of our business, we adhere to equal employment opportunity policies and provide annual employee trainings on diversity, inclusion and equity. We have established Employee Resource Groups to support employees from marginalized populations to help cultivate a healthy workplace culture. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 59% of our employees identify as women and women hold nine of 36 senior management positions, and 61% of our employees identify as under-represented minorities and they hold 19% of senior management positions.

We perform engagement surveys annually to allow us to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement to ensure continued satisfaction and retention of our employees.  Our President and Chief Executive Officer holds a Town Hall-style meeting annually with our employees, covering topics such as business strategy and outlook, our competitive landscape, emerging industry trends and offers a question and answer session with management.

        "Risks Related to Our Human Capital",
        "We depend on our executive officers and other key employees, and our ability to attract additional key personnel, to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy, and we could be harmed by the unexpected loss of their services. ",
        "We believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our executive officers and other key employees and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals, as well as our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management and other skilled employees. Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business strategy may be lengthy. If the services of any of our of key personnel should become unavailable for any reason, we may not be able to identify and hire qualified persons on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and future prospects. We may not be successful in retaining our key personnel, and the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business because of their skill, knowledge of our primary markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement ",

        "personnel. In particular, Keith Mestrich, our President and Chief Executive Officer, resigned effective January 31, 2021. The board of directors appointed Lynne P. Fox to act as our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer while we conduct a search for a permanent successor. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage, and an inadequate transition to a permanent successor may cause disruptions to our business due to, among other things, diverting management’s attention or causing a deterioration in morale.  ",
        "In addition, we do not currently have employment agreements with any of our other executive officers, although we have a change in control policy applicable to certain executive officers and we have severance and retention agreements with Andrew LaBenne, our Chief Financial Officer and Sam Brown, our Head of Commercial Banking to facilitate their long-term retention, particularly during the period that we search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer. In addition, our officers have agreed to a one-year non-solicitation covenant; therefore, these officers could leave us and immediately begin competing against us and after one year begin soliciting our customers. The departure of any of our other personnel could also have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects.",
        "The market for investment managers is extremely competitive and the loss of a key investment manager to a competitor could adversely affect our investment advisory and wealth management business. ",
        "We believe that investment performance is one of the most important factors that affect the amount of assets under our management. As a result, we rely heavily on our investment managers to produce attractive investment returns for our clients. However, the market for investment managers is extremely competitive and is increasingly characterized by frequent movement of investment managers among different firms. In addition, our individual investment managers often have regular direct contact with particular clients, which can lead to a strong client relationship based on the client’s trust in that individual manager. As a result, the loss of a key investment manager to a competitor could jeopardize our relationships with some of our clients and lead to the loss of client accounts. Losses of such accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. ",
        "Our business could suffer if we experience employee work stoppages, union campaigns or other labor difficulties, and efforts by labor unions could divert management attention and adversely affect operating results.",
        "As of December 31, 2020, we had 370 full-time employees, of which approximately 28% are represented by collective bargaining agreements or an employee union. Although we believe that our relationship with our employees is good, and we have not experienced any material work stoppages, work stoppages may occur in the future. Union activities also may significantly increase our labor costs, disrupt our operations and limit our operational flexibility. From time to time, we are subject to unfair labor practice charges, complaints and other legal, administrative and arbitration proceedings initiated against us by unions, the National Labor Relations Board or our employees, which could negatively impact our operating results. In addition, negotiating collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention, which could also adversely affect operating results. On March 11, 2020, we entered into an amended and restated collective bargaining agreement with the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 153, AFL-CIO (“OPEIU”) (the “CBA”) which expires on June 30, 2023. The CBA was updated to include certain provisions in accordance with law and/or in line with our mission, vision and values, such as (i) an expansion of the non-discrimination language, (ii) the inclusion of a lactation provision, (iii) paid family leave, and (iv) the reflection of the $20/hour minimum wage and additional raise to each grade accordingly. It also provided for a 3% wage increase effective July 1, 2020, July 1, 2021 and July 1, 2022, respectively. The CBA made no other material changes to the prior collective bargaining agreements."
