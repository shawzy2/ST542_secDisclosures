        "The Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop quality talent. To support these objectives, the Company’s human resources initiatives are designed to: keep people safe and healthy; enhance the Company’s culture; acquire and retain diverse talent; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefits and other programs; and develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions. In 2020, the Company deployed resources to positively impact all of these objectives. For example, we implemented substantial COVID-19-related safety measures, transitioned much of our workforce to work-from-home, expanded our recruiting efforts and strategies, amplified our total rewards packages, and provided skills, competency and compliance training to more of our team members than ever before.",
