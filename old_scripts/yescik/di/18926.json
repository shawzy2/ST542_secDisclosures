        "We believe that understanding and respecting another’s perspective, experience, background and beliefs provide an opportunity to expand horizons, challenge complacency and foster empathy. For Lumen, diversity of perspective, experience, background and beliefs fuel our innovative, collaborative, and engaged workplace. Realizing greater ethnic, racial and gender diversity across all levels of an organization is, and will continue to be, an ongoing journey. Our Diversity & Inclusion Steering Committee comprised of a cross-functional team of senior executives and led by our Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer, regularly evaluates and seeks to define our diversity, inclusion and belonging strategy. We aim for the highest standards of fairness and equal opportunity, in recruitment, hiring, promotions, job assignments and compensation (including undertaking periodic gender and race/ethnicity pay equity studies of our U.S., non-represented employees and making pay adjustments when warranted). Inclusive recruiting and outreach programs for diverse candidates, employee resource groups, and management-led listening circles are among some of Lumen’s initiatives to create greater diversity and belonging among our employees."
