        "Diversity and Inclusion.  We continue to take steps to expand our role as an employer that champions diversity and inclusion, as we believe it is a key to our future success. This commitment is most recently reflected in the goals of the People Pillar of our Sustainability program, which is being led by our VP Talent Sustainability, who was hired in 2020. We measure gender and racial/ethnic representation and are focusing on our incoming new hires to assist in increasing diversity within the company. In addition, we are committed to engaging in events and outreach that align with our goals to enhance our diversity and inclusion. Our strategy to grow our diversity over time includes (1) providing annual training to employees on diversity and inclusion topics, (2) demonstrating year over year improvement in the diversity of our organization measured by representation of female, minorities and veterans at every level of the organization, and (3) providing employees an annual opportunity to share their views on topics that matter to them."
