        "The Company is committed to establishing a culture of diversity and inclusion where everyone is accepted, valued, supported and encouraged to thrive. We value the different perspectives and solutions our communities bring to the Company, and we believe these perspectives have a positive impact on how we innovate and grow. Our expectation is that our diversity and inclusion program will guide improvements in our culture - specifically, recruiting, training, policies and reporting, leader expectations, and benefits. In 2020, we announced we would launch new employee resource groups in 2021, including Women in the Workplace and Multi-Cultural. We are continuing to enhance our diversity and inclusion initiatives, in conjunction with our CARE Council, to recruit, retain and promote a diverse workforce. These efforts will not only promote innovation and growth but will also strengthen our relationships with customers spanning more than 100 countries with diverse cultural, gender, racial and other profiles."
