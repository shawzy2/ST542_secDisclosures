        "Our culture is strengthened by our core values, which includes a steadfast commitment to diversity and inclusion. As part of our investment in our people, we make diversity and inclusion a priority. Our goal is to create a culture where we value, respect, and provide fair treatment and equal opportunities for all employees. ",
        "In addition, the Company has created a Diversity and Inclusion Committee, led by senior leadership and representatives from each business unit to ensure accountabilities exist to advance new initiatives and causes directed at leveling the playing field for all concerned. Our commitment includes supporting organizations that advance the interests of impacted individuals as well as supporting our communities in need. In the year ended December 31, 2020, our senior leaders also participated in training and discussions around the creation of an inclusive workplace. Employees at all levels across the organization are also participating in trainings to gain a better understanding of unconscious bias and its impact on the business.  Our efforts are also directed internally where we encourage the exchange of ideas, actively listen to employee dialogue, provide appropriate training, and ensure that the interests of all our employees are supported and advanced.  Overall, the Company seeks to create an environment where there is a sense of belonging and all voices are valued. ",
