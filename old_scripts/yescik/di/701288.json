        "The tenets of diversity and inclusion have long been baked into the DNA of our Company. We have always operated our business in the United States, with a highly diverse workforce. Although we laud the popular focus on diversity in the boardroom—our Board had its first female director 18 years ago, one of our four independent directors is a person of color, and we are seeking to add a female director to our Board with the result that two of our five independent directors will be a woman and a person of color—we also believe that the focus on diversity and inclusion should be at all levels of every company. Companies that do not offer opportunities to those who are struggling are failing in this mission. Over half of our employees have at most a high school degree. We proudly employ individuals who have come from difficult circumstances that all too often have the effect of disqualifying them from being hired at many companies, and we believe that businesses that ignore them often are losing out on exceptional talent. Additionally, we do not have a mandatory retirement age, and many of our employees have tenures with us ranging from 10 to 40 years. We believe that our business benefits from the different perspectives a diverse workforce brings us."
