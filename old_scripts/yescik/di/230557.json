        "We recognize that when employees with diverse cultural backgrounds, ideas and experiences work together, it fosters innovation.  We have initiatives to increase representation and cultivate greater inclusion of people with differences in gender, ethnicity, race, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, and socio-economic background.  We have taken steps to (i) promote greater diversity in first-level management positions to create a pipeline to increase future diversity in senior and executive leadership, and (ii) increase members of our Board of Directors (\"Board\") who have diverse backgrounds with a wide range of skills and experience, including the addition of three directors who are Black and Latinx.",
        "As of December 31, 2020, women represented 57% of our non-officer workforce and 31% of our officer workforce.  We have three women on our Board, and increasing the representation of women in senior management roles is a prioritized goal.  Our ethnic diversity for officers and non-officers is consistent with the national average for financial services, but our objective is to increase this representation over time.  Currently, approximately 82% of our workforce is White; and 18% of our workforce is a combination of Black, Latinos, Asians, and all other ethnicities combined."
