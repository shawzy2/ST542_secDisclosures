        ": We believe that a culture of inclusion and diversity enables us to create, develop, and fully leverage the strengths of our workforce to exceed players' and fans' expectations and meet our growth objectives. We remain committed to building and sustaining a culture of belonging, built on equitable processes and systems, where everyone thrives. By embedding DE&I practices and programs in the full employee lifecycle, we work to recruit, attract, retain, and grow world-class talent. Our employee resource groups play an active role in our DE&I efforts by building community and awareness. We also offer leadership and management development opportunities on the topics of unconscious bias and inclusive leadership and train our recruiting workforce in diverse sourcing strategies.",
        "Our Corporate Governance Principles and Policies provide that the initial list from which any new independent director nominee is chosen includes qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates and, similarly, if we conduct an external search for a new CEO, that the initial list of external candidates includes qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates. As of December 31, 2020, two of our ten directors were women. ",
        "Additionally, we have been recognized for our efforts to create an inclusive workplace, including receiving the distinction for two consecutive years as a “Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality” by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index. We are proud of these accolades because we believe that the most innovative work comes from a culture in which all employees can be, and bring, their authentic and best selves."
