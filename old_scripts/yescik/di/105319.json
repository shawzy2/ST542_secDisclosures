        "We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce helps us to explore and realize the many different paths to health and wellness for our members, which leads to better execution of our strategic initiatives. For example, over 50% of the members of our Executive Committee, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, are women. To further our commitment to create an inclusive and diverse culture, we appointed a Head of Inclusion & Diversity who reports directly to our Chief People Officer. Additionally, we offer forums and formal training programs for our employees to enable them to share best practices and experiences with respect to diversity and inclusion in the workplace. "
