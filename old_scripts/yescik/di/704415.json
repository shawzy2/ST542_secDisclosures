        "We embrace diversity and inclusion and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures.  Our CEO has pledged his commitment to the CEO Action for Diversity & InclusionTM, which outlines a specific set of actions the CEO will take to cultivate a trusting environment where all ideas are welcomed, and employees feel comfortable and empowered to have discussions about diversity and inclusion.  To further this effort and in addition to our existing communication vehicles, we have created an internal diversity and inclusion council, launched a diversity-focused listening series, and conducted unconscious bias training sessions with our employees. With the assistance of our diversity and inclusion council, we continue to explore additional diversity and inclusion initiatives."
