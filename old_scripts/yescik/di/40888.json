        " (\"ID&E\") â€“ We believe in the strength of engaged and diverse teams in an inclusive work environment to unleash the potential of our employees. Through the efforts of these diverse and collaborative teams, we seek to be on the cutting edge of technology and exceed customer expectations. We have established a corporate-wide ID&E council and a number of executive-sponsored employee resource groups (\"ERG\") across the enterprise, where employees can foster connections and develop in a supportive environment. Our ERGs support the acquisition of diverse talent internally and externally. To assess and improve employee engagement, we survey our employees and take actions to address areas of employee concern."
