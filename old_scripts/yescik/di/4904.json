We foster an inclusive workplace that encourages diversity of thought, culture and background, and actively work to eliminate unconscious biases.  We believe our workforce should reﬂect the diversity of our customers and the communities we serve so that we may better understand how to tailor our services to meet their demands and expectations.  As of December 31, 2020, females comprised approximately 20% of AEP’s workforce while approximately 19% was represented by minorities.",
        "AEP has taken actions to denounce all forms of racism in the wake of the racial and social unrest across the country.  AEP Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Nicholas Akins joined more than 1,400 other CEOs as a signatory to the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion within the workplace.  To accelerate our diversity and inclusion strategy, AEP has initiated a “Seize the Moment: Let’s Keep the Momentum Going” action plan that included candid conversations about race, Town Hall webcasts and “Let’s Talk” discussions with the top 20 African American leaders at AEP."
