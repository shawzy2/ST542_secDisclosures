        "The Company believes in an inclusive workforce, where employees from a number of cultures and countries are engaged and encouraged to leverage their collective talents. We have employees in over 40 countries around the world.  As of the date of filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, women comprised roughly 30% of our leadership positions on a global basis, which we define as director level and above. We expect to provide further information regarding our diversity demographics in our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report or elsewhere on our website at www.perkinelmer.com, including summarized data from our EEO-1 form. An EEO-1 form is a report filed with United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission describing the racial, ethnic and gender composition of our US-based workforce. Information on our website, including the CSR Report, shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report."
