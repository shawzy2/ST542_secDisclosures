        "Our leadership is committed to attracting, retaining and developing a highly engaged, high-performing, diverse workforce and cultivating an inclusive workplace where all employees feel valued and have a sense of belonging. Increasing our diversity and inclusion efforts is an organizational priority and strategic oversight of our efforts is provided by our Compensation Committee. We have introduced diversity awareness programs focused on increasing the number of underrepresented persons in engineering roles in our refineries and corporate office. Our university recruiting team has partnered with historically Black colleges and universities to offer full-time and summer internship opportunities and various diversity and inclusion organizations at universities to sponsor and participate in events, such as the North Texas Womenâ€™s Energy Network and the National Society of Black Engineers Convention. In addition, to help foster a culture of inclusion, we have two employee resource groups focused on strengthening our support of women and veterans in the workplace."
