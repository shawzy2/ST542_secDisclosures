        "Chevron is committed to advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace so that employees are enabled to contribute to their full potential. The company believes innovative solutions to its most complex challenges emerge when diverse people, ideas, and experiences come together in an inclusive environment. Chevron reinforces the value of diversity and inclusion through accountability, communication, training and personnel selection processes. Examples of initiatives to further advance diversity and inclusion include the companyâ€™s Neurodiversity program through which the company employs neurodiverse individuals and leverages their talents, its Elevate program which focuses on learning opportunities to promote a deeper understanding of employees in underrepresented groups, and its Returnship initiative which provides support for women re-entering the workforce. In addition, Chevron has twelve employee networks (voluntary groups of employees that come together based on shared identity or interests) and more than fifteen diversity councils across its business units that help align diversity and inclusion efforts with business strategies."
