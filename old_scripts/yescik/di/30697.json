        "We believe our strategic focus on diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) helps the Company deliver on our values as well as support our financial performance and global growth strategy.  Creating and fostering inclusive work environments and teams allows us to create an engaging and welcoming culture for our employees, which we believe positively affects the quality of products and experience we deliver to our customers. ",
        "Our DE&I strategy is built around three pillars.  First, we seek to increase our knowledge and accountability to ensure we have a diverse and inclusive mindset.  Next, we work to ensure our recruiting and hiring initiatives are reaching a broad audience, so that our workforce represents the communities in which we serve.  Third, we strive to expand and develop a strong, diverse pipeline of talent by providing opportunities for growth and development at all levels of our organization.  Our senior management and Board of Directors serve an integral role in our DE&I strategy, providing guidance and oversight.",
        "We are fortunate to have several thriving Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), which are voluntary employee-led groups, each sponsored by a Wendy’s senior leadership team member.  Our ERGs serve an important role in support of our DE&I strategy, creating forums for learning and inclusion, opportunities to celebrate different backgrounds, empowering employees to bring their authentic self to work, and creating leadership and professional development opportunities.  Our ERGs focus on employees and allies who identify as Women (Women of Wendy’s), LGBTQ+ (WeQual), Military Veterans & Families (WeVets), Culturally Diverse (WCDN), Black (WeBERG) and Young Professional (WenGEN).
