        "Diversity and Inclusion are core to our culture, and we believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success. GP Strategies strives to create an environment that welcomes, and values inclusion and diversity based on age, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, personality type, and thinking style.  To foster our goals surrounding diversity and inclusion, we have created several Employee Resource Groups based on employee feedback, including those supporting Women, Black, and the LGBTQ+ communities.  The Company has a dedicated Vice President of Diversity & Engagement, and a Diversity Council made up of employees, that provides regular updates to senior management.  "
