Our goal is to reflect the diversity of our consumers throughout our Company. We report to our Board of Directors on a periodic basis about the actions we have taken to make progress on our ED&I journey, and we are firmly committed to continuing to advance our ED&I priorities. Our focus on equity, diversity and inclusion enables us to build a culture where employees are inspired to share their passion, talents and ideas.  ",
