        "We embrace ID&E in our workforce, customers, partners and shareholders, valuing their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and talents. Our mission is to empower all employees to bring their full authentic selves to work as One Deluxe and to foster an environment that reflects the diverse communities we serve. We strive to cultivate a culture and vision that supports and enhances our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level. We provide our customers, partners, and shareholders information about our ID&E program and our activities supporting social justice within the communities we serve. In addition, we are focused on furthering our ID&E initiatives throughout our business and have, among other things, created an ID&E council that is sponsored by our Chief Communications and Human Resources Officer and our Chief Revenue Officer. This council is comprised of employee-owners across multiple functions and business segments. Its top priorities for the next two years include implementing a comprehensive ID&E learning and development plan to build awareness and drive inclusive behaviors, further developing our diversity pipeline through hiring, mentoring and coaching, and establishing goals and metrics to ensure progress.",
