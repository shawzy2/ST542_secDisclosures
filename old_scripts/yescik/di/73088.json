        " A diverse and inclusive workforce adds value to our company and helps us succeed in an ever-changing environment. By embracing diversity and fostering inclusion, we aim to enable each employee, executive, and director to contribute fully to the company. We believe diversity is important because varied perspectives expand our ability to bring unique professional experiences to our business. Diversity in the workforce may be considered when relevant to hiring, promotions, work assignments, or other decisions related to the terms and conditions of employment. Our workforce reflects the relative diversity of our available talent in the communities we serve. Our employment data is tested annually by a third party as part of our Affirmative Action plan development to identify any needed corrective placement goals that are required. This testing determined that there is no current need to establish corrective placement goals in our plan.",
        "Of our total workforce, 28 percent of our employees are female, and 24 percent of our employees in management positions are female, including three of our eight executive officers. Additionally, 2020 Women on Boards has recognized our gender diversity, with four females among our ten directors who sit on our board. We have implemented methods to provide pay equity between our female and male employees performing equal or substantially similar work. We have engaged with a third party to review our pay equity between our male and female employees, share the results with our Board of Directors, and take corrective action as necessary. Our most recent study was performed in 2019, with no corrective action required. "
