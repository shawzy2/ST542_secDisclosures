We always seek to attract, develop and retain the most qualified people for all our positions while focusing on embedding diversity inclusion to build a unique blend of cultures, backgrounds, skills and beliefs that mirror the world we live in.  We strongly believe our ongoing initiatives in minority, women and veterans hiring contribute to gains in employee retention, growth and development, which invariably lead to improved operating and financial performance. For example, we believe that the contributions of the women at World Fuel Services are instrumental for the success of our global business and therefore, we strive to seize each opportunity to encourage and support women within our organization, as we recognize the importance of empowering women to reduce the gender inequalities in our society.  We recently gathered more than 200 of our female colleagues globally as part of an International Women’s Day event to celebrate women’s accomplishments and provided opportunities for development, networking and mentorship. These types of events offer a great platform to facilitate the exchange of experiences among our female colleagues, with the goal of empowering the women of World Fuel Services in their professional and personal lives."

We are therefore actively engaged in, and maintain programs driven at attracting, developing, and retaining a team of individuals who will exemplify the goals of our first pillar. As of December31, 2020, we employed 2,462 full-time equivalent employees, none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. This represents a decrease of 11 full-time equivalent employees from December31, 2019. We believe this relatively minor decrease, experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, is a testament to the strength of our relationships with our employees and is evidence that our retention tools are working. As of December31, 2020, approximately 72.3% of our full-time equivalent workforce was female, 27.7% was male, and their average tenure was 8.3 years, an increase of 3.8% from an average tenure of 8.0 years as of December31, 2019.
