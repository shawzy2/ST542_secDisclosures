We always seek to attract, develop and retain the most qualified people for all our positions while focusing on embedding diversity inclusion to build a unique blend of cultures, backgrounds, skills and beliefs that mirror the world we live in.  We strongly believe our ongoing initiatives in minority, women and veterans hiring contribute to gains in employee retention, growth and development, which invariably lead to improved operating and financial performance. For example, we believe that the contributions of the women at World Fuel Services are instrumental for the success of our global business and therefore, we strive to seize each opportunity to encourage and support women within our organization, as we recognize the importance of empowering women to reduce the gender inequalities in our society.  We recently gathered more than 200 of our female colleagues globally as part of an International Women’s Day event to celebrate women’s accomplishments and provided opportunities for development, networking and mentorship. These types of events offer a great platform to facilitate the exchange of experiences among our female colleagues, with the goal of empowering the women of World Fuel Services in their professional and personal lives."
