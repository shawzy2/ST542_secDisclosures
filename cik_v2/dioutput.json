We always seek to attract, develop and retain the most qualified people for all our positions while focusing on embedding diversity inclusion to build a unique blend of cultures, backgrounds, skills and beliefs that mirror the world we live in.  We strongly believe our ongoing initiatives in minority, women and veterans hiring contribute to gains in employee retention, growth and development, which invariably lead to improved operating and financial performance. For example, we believe that the contributions of the women at World Fuel Services are instrumental for the success of our global business and therefore, we strive to seize each opportunity to encourage and support women within our organization, as we recognize the importance of empowering women to reduce the gender inequalities in our society.  We recently gathered more than 200 of our female colleagues globally as part of an International Women’s Day event to celebrate women’s accomplishments and provided opportunities for development, networking and mentorship. These types of events offer a great platform to facilitate the exchange of experiences among our female colleagues, with the goal of empowering the women of World Fuel Services in their professional and personal lives."

Further, AbbVie is committed to pay equity and conducts pay equity analyses annually. A critical component of AbbVie's strategy is to instill an inclusive mindset in all AbbVie leaders and employees, so the company can realize the full value of a diverse workforce from recruitment through retirement.

In 2020, DFIN hosted a series of conversations with its global workforce that generated ideas on how the Company could continue to create an inclusive, equitable and diverse environment, with emerging themes of education and awareness, advocacy and support and fairness and equality. An employee-led DEI task force is creating recommendations around each of those areas. While the Company supports employee-led efforts, the Company believes it is equally important that leadership is engaged. DFIN’s Chief Executive Officer, Dan Leib, expressed the Company’s commitment to DEI in a letter that was shared with employees and posted to its website in the fall of 2020. DFIN has made progress in bringing more diverse perspectives to leadership. Since the beginning of 2020, approximately 32% of all hires and promotions at the Vice President level were women or part of an underrepresented group and approximately 31% of all hires and promotions at the Director level were women. Women and people who are part of an underrepresented group constitute approximately 30% and 15% of the Company’s independent Board of Directors, respectively. Approximately 33% of DFIN’s employees in managerial roles were female and approximately 24% of its employees in managerial roles were part of an underrepresented group. Creating an inclusive community in which all voices are heard is key to the Company’s success."
